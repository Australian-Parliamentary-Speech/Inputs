        —Madam Speaker, I rise on a matter of privilege. On 15 December in the Australian Financial Review an article by Mr Steve Burrell stated:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       A spokeswoman for the Government House Leader, Mr Beazley, said the House would almost certainly be recalled next Wednesday and would probably sit for about two hours-the bare minimum necessary to debate the amendments.
      </para>
      <para>
       We will gag, gag, gag', she said.
      </para>
      <para>
       Madam Speaker, under our procedures and practices, as you would be aware, a very grave restraint is imposed on anybody who seeks to impede the freedom of speech in this place. The Bill of Rights, which some on the other side sought to restate, replace and rephrase, said that the freedom of speech and debates or proceedings in Parliament ought not to be impeached or questioned in any court or place out of Parliament. Madam Speaker, I submit to you that it is totally inappropriate for any member of staff in any way to seek to impede the rights of members in this place to act as they believe proper on issues that they might wish to canvass.
      </para>
      <para>
       If one goes through both Pettifer's House of Representatives Practice and May's Parliamentary Practice, one sees that there are any number of references to the extent to which the privileges of speech in this place, freedom of speech and freedom of canvassing issues are sacrosanct. I suggest to you that for a member of staff to be quoted in that way is totally improper. Whatever the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) might do in here is different. For the Leader of the House in this place to move the guillotine or to move a gag is a procedure and practice which is condoned. But to have somebody who is a member of staff outside the place saying that it is not permissible for anybody in this Parliament to act other than in the way which she says I regard as not only an impertinence but also quite contrary to the procedures and practices laid down.
      </para>
      <para>
       Madam Speaker, there are any number of references such as:
      </para>
      <para>
       In so far as the House claims and Members enjoy those rights and immunities which are grouped under the general description of `privileges', they are claimed and enjoyed by the House in its corporate capacity and by its Members on behalf of the citizens whom they represent.
      </para>
      <para>
       That statement affects not any one of us; it affects us as a collection of individuals who are here, having been elected by our constituency.
      </para>
      <para>
       I have referred to the Bill of Rights and to the sacrosanct role that that imposes on us. Among the interpretations that have been placed on this, Madam Speaker, as you would be aware, there are a number of interpretations that are worthy of note. For example, in chapter X May refers to the fact that to attempt to influence members in their conduct by threats is a breach of privilege. May also says:
      </para>
      <para>
       Conduct not amounting to a direct attempt to influence a Member in the discharge of his duties, but having a tendency to impair his independence in the future performance of his duty, will also be treated as a breach of privilege.
      </para>
      <para>
       I refer in that instance to page 151 of May.
      </para>
      <para>
       Madam Speaker, I put it to you that it is improper for any member of staff to act in this way. I think it is important on a day such as this, when we have been called back for a specific purpose on a matter which very much affects the interests of all the members of this House and we seek to canvass matters which we regard as of prime moment, to note that it is not proper for any member of staff to act in that way. I submit to you that there is a prima facie case of breach of privilege and I trust that you will act accordingly.

         —Mr Chairman, I understand that the matter before us at the moment is not the series of amendments which the Senate has it in mind to make to this Bill but rather the request that the House of Representatives should agree to the proposition that establishment grants for some non-government schools should be reinstated in 1989. That is the request we have before us at the moment. The other amendments in respect of this Bill presumably will come before us later, once the Senate has had the opportunity to consider the attitude of the House to this particular request.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The Government does not accept this request from the Senate, basically because it involves an increase in expenditure over and above that which the Government had accepted earlier. The context in which this decision was made was that earlier in the year, in the May statement, the Government was reviewing its policy in relation to the funding of schools and agreed to continue the second four-year period of funding for government and non-government schools. In the context of that decision it was decided to review certain other policy aspects, including the provision of establishment grants for new schools. At that time we agreed to eliminate establishment grants except in respect of those schools which were already in receipt of establishment grants.

        What we have at the moment is a Senate, and more particularly an Opposition, which is trying to increase the Government's outlays and therefore overturn a decision which was taken in the Budget context. There have been numerous examples of where the Opposition has said that it is not its intention to change or amend Budget decisions in such a way as would increase outlays. Indeed, only today we had the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) again calling for expenditure reductions. How on earth can he support a proposition on the one hand which is to reduce expenditure and yet at the same time overturn or be party to overturning a Government decision which would do precisely that, that is, reduce government outlays in this particular area. To accept this request would involve increased expenditure of some $1.8m over the next three years.
       </para>
       <para>
        The important thing about this issue is that there is a question of principle here about whether the Senate should be able to interfere with the Budget measures of the Government, particularly in a context where the Opposition has said on numerous occasions that it would not participate in the Senate in some arrangement which would overturn properly made Budget decisions. It is all very well for some non-entity senator from South Australia, purporting to act as the Opposition's spokesman in this area, to propose these amendments but there comes a time when the Opposition in this House has to stand up and decide whether it is going to be part of that caprice on the part of a non-entity senator from South Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        The other point about this proposal is that it is in fact technically deficient. Even if one were to accept this request in its current form, it would have no effect. In other words, the drafting of it has been so sloppy, so ill-considered, that whereas it is purported to re-establish establishment grants for certain schools, in its current wording, its current drafting, it would not have such an effect. It is quite clear what the intent of this amendment is and it is for that reason that the Government will not accept the amendment, either in this form or any amended and therefore technically operative form.
       </para>
       <para>
        There are other amendments which the Senate intends to advise us of in relation to this Bill. I will refrain from making my observations about those matters until they are properly before us.

My third point is that it is quite clear that what the Senate has in mind is to require the Government, with these changes, to account more fully on the whole question of its funding for schools.

If the Opposition does manage to get its amendments in the Senate in order, its action will have the effect of increasing Commonwealth outlays by an amount of $1.8m. It is worth making some comment on this matter at the start of today's business because two or three similar situations will occur during the morning. Requests will come in from the Senate for the Government in effect to increase Commonwealth outlays. This is the first of them.

        What needs to be clearly understood in this regard is that we have an Opposition going around the country touting itself as a Budget cutter. Opposition members are attempting to sell their position on tax reform and on other issues on the basis of their capacity to conduct their affairs in a disciplined manner and to conduct the business of this Government in a disciplined manner by the alleged courage of their actions on Commonwealth outlays. Indeed, they have in the past talked about $13 billion worth of cuts. Every time that matter is tested in this place-and this is one of those tests-they fail the test. They are failing the test on this $1.8m proposal. It needs to be quite clearly understood in the country that this is the case.
       </para>
       <para>
        We have here, in these amendments, a test of the Opposition's capacity to discipline public funding. This is a test for the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard). When this matter is divided on as it subsequently will be in this chamber today-and there will be other occasions when there will be these tests set by the Opposition's activity in the Senate-we will know by Opposition members' deeds in this place how serious they are about their capacities to deliver on funding cuts in order to be able to fund their tax promises and the other promises that they make. I am quite sure that, when we see their deeds in this chamber, we will know that they are members of an Opposition without the courage to take hard decisions and without the capacity to set sensible priorities. They run around this country constantly looking for opportunities to flatter any particular group, which takes their fancy at any time, with promises of handouts. This is one such example of that.
       </para>
       <para>
        We on this side of the Committee have learned over the years that the only way to govern this country is to govern it on the basis of a degree of fiscal discipline, in other words, to make hard choices. What these decisions that we are debating at the moment represent is one of many examples of this Government's ability to take hard decisions. What we see, of course, is the total incapacity of the Opposition when confronted with this proposal in the Senate to eschew the opportunity for a minor degree of grandstanding, to walk away from the short term political benefit of an element of grandstanding and to come into this place and actually to put themselves on the record as supporting the Government in the area of fiscal discipline. As usual the Opposition fails the test.
       </para>
       <para>
        From what the Opposition shadow spokesman has just said, he blatantly intends to fail the test here today. He says, when he makes his point here today, `The Government does not control the Budget'. The Government does put the Budget before the House. That is conceded. It puts it before the Senate. What happens in the House and the Senate is a demonstration to the public whether there is will in the House and the Senate to accept, as in this instance, the hard medicine that is sometimes required when effectively operating the economy of this country. He is quite accurate when he says that, in the final analysis, the Budget has to be determined by the House and the Senate. What we saw from the House was a willingness to face up to that discipline with no help from the Opposition. What we saw from the Senate, where the Opposition has the numbers, is the presentation of the fact that the Opposition is unwilling to face that discipline in the formal processes of its consideration of these problems. What we on this side of the House are happy to do is to see Opposition members obliged now to put their stamp on their discipline in the Senate. They will have, as I said, two or three opportunities this day to put their stamp on their discipline. We are going to provide them with the opportunity to do just that.

         —The argument put forward by the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) might have some substance if indeed he knew something about the subject of the funding of schools. But, since he quite clearly indicates that he does not, his point has absolutely no substance. What we are talking about is a small measure of support for the establishment of non-government schools. As every schoolboy knows, whenever a student goes to a non-government school as opposed to a government school there is a net saving to the taxpayer which is very substantial. Certainly, you, Mr Chairman, would be aware of this as am I, given the origins of our schooling. Also, I think the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr John Brown) would have to agree with that proposition too.

       <para>
        The proposal is a relatively modest one in terms of current expenditure. The actual savings to the Commonwealth over the longer period when these schools are established is very, very substantial indeed. It has to be understood that schooling in Australia is a cooperative effort between governments and private institutions. All we are doing here is attempting to assist parents to have choice in education. But, of course, when they exercise that choice, they also accept a financial responsibility and relieve the taxpayer of a great deal of that responsibility. I have to say to the Minister that the argument that he has put up is totally without substance. Honourable members on this side of the Committee can quite happily vote in favour of the Senate's sensible action without taking into account these nonsensical arguments.

         —Notwithstanding the meaningless interjection from the honourable member, who is at the table, I remind him that the Opposition still had time to foreshadow at least the amendments that have been moved in the Senate. One must ask oneself why this chamber had to be recalled today at great expense to the taxpayer to deal with these Bills. As the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) was pointing out quite rightly, what this action really means is expending more money. Wherever we look, the Opposition is talking about how it is going to cut spending. In turn, we talk about the fiscal responsibility Opposition members are about to show; and we ask them where the money is coming from to pay for these tax cuts that they are always holding out. I contrast that with a proposal like this from the Opposition. It actually increases expenditure. It does not decrease it at all. We on this side of the Committee are starting to wonder where these cuts are ever to be made because the Opposition is very non-specific about them. In the recess, we had the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard), in response to unemployment levels, saying the Opposition was going to make 19- to 21-year-olds or perhaps it was 18- to 21-year-olds work for the dole. What a mindless statement from the leader of a major party in addressing one of the most pressing problems facing this country today. Certainly, the Government has taken the view that, if unemployment is to be tackled in a meaningful way, what we really have to do is to provide more training. The Bills that were passed by this chamber and amended in the Senate do just that. We have only to look at the record of this Government compared with those of its predecessors to recognise that training under this Government has received a very high priority. This action is reflected in the schools. When we came into Government, the retention rate in our high schools was only 36 per cent, which is one of the lowest in OECD countries. That demonstrated the record of the Opposition on education. Today, retention rates are in excess of 50 per cent. We will get the figure up to 65 per cent by the early 1990s and go on from there.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I mention technical and further education (TAFE), where huge amounts of money have been invested by this Government and skills for employment have received a very much greater priority than they did in the past. We have played our part in making sure that TAFE is relevant in the 1980s. In higher education, a net gain of about 140,000 places up to 1991 has been foreshadowed by this Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        This amendment was carried with the intent of reversing the Government's decision, announced in the May statement, to discontinue the establishments grants scheme for new non-government schools from 1989. We all remember prior to 1983 when the approval for non-government schools was given by State governments, yet it was the Federal Government which paid the bill. So, the State governments could go around and curry favour with local constituencies by allowing them to establish these non-government schools and pass the bill on to the Federal Government. That ended as soon as this Government was elected.
       </para>
       <para>
        Of course, we have looked at the school situation as a total overall package, not in a piecemeal fashion, as this amendment does. That decision, announced in the May statement, was made as part of a generous overall package, which included a commitment, being given effect to by this legislation, to provide guaranteed real increases in general recurrent funding to government and non-government schools from 1989 to 1992. It also provides for the retention of existing funding categories for all non-government schools for the same period-from 1989 to 1992. It included a decision to allow non-government schools to increase their private income without affecting the level of the Government's general recurrent funding over the funding period. It provided further for the removal of the legislative requirement that proposed non-government schools be able to demonstrate that they have reasonable prospects of financial viability prior to receiving approval. All of those matters are covered by legislation. All of them are progressive. Yet we have to come back here today because the Senate in its lack of wisdom sought to amend these Bills and to take a step backwards, which is something we have come to expect from this Opposition.
       </para>
       <para>
        The amendment does not, however, meet its intention. It does not enable the payment of any new establishment grants in 1989 as the necessary enabling provision in the body of the Bill has not been amended. Even when the Opposition amended this Bill to give effect to some desire to go back in time, the Opposition did not do it correctly. Furthermore, the amendment of the schedule establishes per capita rates for establishment grants in respect of three years. The establishment grant scheme, however, provided for the payment of grants over four years. We can see that in the Senate the Opposition did not do its homework even on this amendment. We have been recalled here today at great expense to the taxpayers. I have seen estimates ranging from $500,000 to $2m to bring this chamber back today to deal with this amendment which is not even put up in its correct form. Of course, the Government will not accept this amendment.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government also does not accept the intent behind the amendment. Establishment grants were not paid on the basis of applications from schools and their subsequent approval. Establishment grants were effectively automatically paid to schools located in developing areas following their meeting the final approval requirements for Commonwealth general recurrent funding. It seems to me that everything this Government has done in establishing private schools and maintaining those private schools that have already been established has been done on both educational and financial grounds. There is no use putting up schools in areas where the student population will not maintain them. There has to be fiscal restraint in the provision of private or public education. There has to be a fiscal requirement that the establishment of those facilities is necessary, that we are not wasting money by duplicating educational services in areas that cannot sustain them. That has been the whole intention of the Government in the legislation embodied in this package of Bills. The Senate's amendment goes back to the old scheme.
       </para>
       <para>
        It seems to me that those who supported the amendment in the Senate should have made themselves aware of what the Government's intentions were and brought themselves up to the 1980s. When one hears some of the contributions from the other side of the chamber one can be forgiven for thinking that one is in a time warp and one is really back in the 1950s. It is required of members of the Opposition that they address educational matters, economic matters and matters of great importance to this Parliament in the context of the 1980s, not the 1950s. Certainly the amendment of the Senate that is before us today is ample demonstration of the fact that we have in the Senate, in one small space, the greatest collection of incompetents in Australia. They put up amendments such as this which are incomplete, which do not match the intentions of the Government, which are not progressive and which force those of us who are working hard in our electorates on behalf of our constituents to give up that work and fly all the way back here to deal with the amendments.

         —I want to respond to a couple of the points made by the honourable member for Deakin (Mr Beale). He purports to say that the Opposition has well-considered views on these matters and was denied the opportunity to express those views because of the circumstances in which the debate was held in this chamber. I refer honourable members to a debate which occurred here nearly a month ago when we were considering this matter and other education matters. Whilst members of the Opposition did not have their act together at that point, it is true that the honourable member for Deakin did foreshadow that the Opposition would be making certain observations in the form of moving amendments to some of these measures in the Senate.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I want to point out that the honourable member said at that point that their amendments would be criticising the Government for its tightening of the rules governing non-systemic, non-government, schools, as announced in the May statement. He went on to say that the amendments would also criticise us for the removal of establishment grants for 1989. There is a huge difference between moving amendments which have the effect of criticising the Government for making certain decisions-any Opposition, whether here or in the Senate, is entitled to do that-and moving amendments which have the effect of changing policy in a way which increases outlays on the part of the Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Constitution is very clear about this. At section 53 it says that the Senate may not make amendments which have the effect of increasing the burden on the people, that is, by increasing outlays which have to be met by taxpayers' funds. Therefore, what the Opposition has in fact done in the Senate is not what the Opposition foreshadowed here a month ago when the honourable member for Deakin said it would seek to criticise the Government for certain decisions that the Government had taken. No, the Opposition went much further than that and actually proposed in this request a change to the Bill in a way which, instead of criticising the Government, reverses a decision which the Government took.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is unacceptable conduct by members of the Opposition in the Senate to pick and choose on government measures, to agree with those things which they like and to disagree with those things which they do not like in a way which has the effect of increasing outlays. The Minister for Defence (Mr Beazley) was perfectly right in saying that the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) cannot strut around this country saying that the Government must reduce expenditure-indeed, saying that the Opposition would reduce expenditure, without having the courage to identify where it would reduce expenditure-and then propose in the Senate, and support in this chamber, measures which would not reduce expenditure but, in fact, increase expenditure. That is why this is such a wicked measure on the part of the Opposition; one which the Opposition in this chamber is now going to support actively, quite out of context with what the enfeebled shadow Minister for education-the honourable member for Deakin-said when he addressed the chamber one month ago.
       </para>
       <para>
        In terms of the technical deficiencies in this measure, the honourable member for Deakin says, `That is just a simple matter of changing a figure here or there'. That is not the case at all. The fact of the matter is that the Senate has sought to change the Bill in one part but not in another part and unless it is changed in both areas the request has no effect. Has the honourable member come in here with a measure to rectify that deficiency? No, because he would not understand what the technical deficiency was and he would not know how to go about rectifying it if he did. If he was going to do something to rectify it, this was his opportunity to do so. But no, he sits there glued to his chair, petrified because he does not even understand how the request might be changed in a way to make it technically efficient.
       </para>
       <para>
        The other point I want to make is that this was part of a package of measures, an historically important package of measures, to support government and non-government schools throughout Australia. This was just one part of an historically generous set of measures designed to improve the confidence with which government and non-government schools, particularly non-government schools, can plan for the future. We were not only legislating funds for the next four years for the non-government sector as well as the government school sector but also legislating very substantial increases for those schools over the next four years. We have an eight-year funding period and we are now legislating for the second part of that. There will be 40 per cent increases in real terms for primary schools and 30 per cent for secondary schools as far as the non-government school sector is concerned.
       </para>
       <para>
        This is a very important package of measures, a package which involves the expenditure next year of $1.8 billion, expenditure which inevitably will be delayed as a result of the conduct of the Senate. This capricious Senate seeks to meddle around in these matters. It does not understand. It cannot get it right when it tries and it does it in a way which verges on the unconstitutional in any event. The Senate is prepared to delay the expenditure of $1.8 billion on the support of Australian school children all round the country in order to make this trite point, a point which the Senate cannot even get correct technically. As a result of this meddling in matters which the Senate clearly does not understand and clearly has no place in, the Senate is going to ensure that the payments which we had hoped to be making on time for the non-government school sector will be delayed. By all accounts they will be delayed as a consequence of the Senate's action and as a result of the recall of the House of Representatives.

        These are serious matters. We are talking about delaying the provision of $1.8 billion to, particularly, the non-government schools sector, whose sources of funds are not as extensive as those of the government school sector. This is the real issue which has to be confronted by the Opposition. The Opposition wants to do what it said it would never do; that is, change Budget decisions in a way which would increase the overall outlays of the Budget. Secondly, the Opposition wants to do it in a way which will delay the timely payment of subsidies by the Government to the non-government school sector. It is quite clear that the Senate has raised a series of alarms amongst those who are dependent on these funds. The National Catholic Education Commission has expressed to me its concern about the prospect of the payments being delayed as a result of these matters not being resolved quickly as between the two Houses.

        These measures must be seen as a package. We are increasing substantially the per capita grants to both government and non- government schools. We are making a number of other important changes as well. One of them involves the discontinuation of establishment grants. It seems to me that if this Opposition wants to be taken seriously in the electorate as a party which can make difficult decisions in difficult economic circumstances, it ought to be recanting and saying, `Those senators, once again, have got out of control. They have not only abandoned an important principle of the Opposition parties of not opposing Budget measures in a way which would increase outlays but also mucked up the way in which they have proposed it'.
       </para>
       <para>
        Those are the reasons why the Government cannot accept this request. This request must be turned down. We would hope that, as a result of the turning down of that request, the Senate will realise the folly of its ways and quickly return the Bill to the House of Representatives in a way in which it can be approved quickly here so that these payments can flow to the eligible recipients.

         —I rise simply to draw the attention of the House to the fact that the Government is working on what is called the Goebbels principle-if the Government repeats a point often enough, it will be believed. We continually hear from the other side of the chamber the claim that in this measure the Opposition is not working in the direction of containing government expenditure, as the Opposition advocates has to be done, but is in fact advocating an increase. But the point is that the Opposition is concerned to maintain this aspect of the legislation-these establishment grants-basically, at least in the first instance, to increase choice, something in which we believe very strongly indeed.

        But it is also important to recognise that when non-government schools are established the parents, often at very considerable sacrifice, thereupon assume a significant proportion of the burden of the cost of educating Australian children. So while in the first instance it may have the effect of slightly increasing expenditure, the fact is that in the longer run it reduces the level of government expenditure because a proportion of the financial burden is assumed by the parent.

         —It is just a matter of a short period of time, as my colleague says. The Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) and other Government speakers will go on insisting that the Opposition, which says that government expenditure ought to be cut-indeed, it ought and, indeed, the Government will find that it will have to get round to that early in the new year-is not being true to its principles. But the point is that it should be recognised that the effect of this amendment is to facilitate the development of non- government schools. That is a good thing from the point of view of increasing the choice available to parents, but it also has the effect that the parents who subsequently support the children assume some of the financial burden and that reduces, in effect, government outlays and the burden on the taxpayer.

        To ensure passage of the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill (No. 2) the Government will accept it as amended by the Senate. However, the Government wishes to place on the record that it does not accept the Opposition's views concerning the date of effect of the amendment to item 92 of the first schedule of the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act.

         —As the Minister Assisting the Treasurer (Mr Peter Morris) indicated, the proposed amendment is one moved by the Opposition in the Senate. It is all very well the Minister saying he wants to place on the record that he does not accept our view of the matter; the fact is that we have before us once again an amendment brought about by Opposition action striking out an outrageous form of retrospectivity. The Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Amendment Bill (No. 2) seeks to give full effect to sales tax changes announced in the Budget and the phrase sales tax changes, which I ought to put in quotes, is of course a Government euphemism for sales tax increases. Among other things the Treasurer (Mr Keating) announced on Budget night was that taxation on all goods of the kind used to wrap or secure goods for marketing or delivery would increase from zero to 20 per cent. That is a 20 per cent increase, of course, and also there will now be a 10 per cent tax on thick shake mixes used in the manufacture of thick shakes. They were previously exempt. Ice-creams that were previously exempt will now be taxed at 10 per cent. In addition, accessories to takeaway food containers such as spoons and serviettes will now be subject to a tax of 10 per cent. They were also previously exempt.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The Government describes these changes as `correcting anomalies and inconsistencies'. As I have said before, the Government is very adept at using such euphemisms. For years it has been talking about its great tax reforms. What it means, of course, is its great tax increases. There is no disputing that this Government, as we have said time and again, is the highest taxing government in the peacetime history of our nation. It has just plundered the pockets of Australian taxpayers and much of this has been done through taxation by stealth in the form of the wholesale sales tax system.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the case of Sales Tax Bill (No. 2), the Government has become worried that it may lose some of the revenue it has greedily sought to suck in. It seems that the original sales tax legislation introduced on Budget night, dealing with the changes I referred to before, was ambiguous in its meaning. A number of accountants were advising their clients that certain types of packaging material were not covered by the new legislation. The Government, always speedy when it sees a leakage in revenue, pounced on this gap and introduced Sales Tax Bill (No. 2) to cover all eventualities. Typically, however, instead of admitting it had made a mistake and acknowledging that the claims of the accountants were correct, the Government arrogantly backdated the second lot of legislation to Budget night and effectively said such advice was wrong, retrospectively speaking. There is obviously an outrageous retrospective penalty on those firms which took advantage of their accountants' legitimate advice that certain areas of packaging were not taxable. As a result, the Opposition correctly moved in the Senate a motion that struck out the retrospectivity by making the new Bill apply from the date of its introduction. It should have been taken into account when the Government introduced the legislation. So the Minister makes some brief remarks saying he places on the record that he disagrees with our interpretation, but honourable members will note that he did not seek to argue in support of that proposition-because there is no case to argue. This was an outrageous attempt at retrospectivity.
       </para>
       <para>
        I would have thought that, after stupidly trying and failing to get the 3 1/2-year retrospective, non-cash business benefits legislation through the Senate, the Government would have learned its lesson. But no, it does not seem to understand the principle of a fair go and it is only after it has been beaten in the Senate that it seems to take any notice of what people are saying. This Government, frankly, is only interested in the numbers-be it the numbers in the House, where it uses them maliciously to gag debate and stifle democracy, or the numbers in the Australian Taxation Office where they watch those piles of tax revenue increase and increase. Thankfully the Government does not have the numbers in the upper House, thankfully we are able to be zealous in our pursuit of such retrospective legislation and as a consequence the Opposition has prevented yet another unacceptable case of retrospective legislation.

        The first amendment will change the date the transitional provisions relating to dividend imputation come into effect. The date of effect for these provisions will be 1 January 1989 rather than the date on which the amending Act receives royal assent. The transitional imputation provisions will prevent franked dividends paid by early balancing companies with imputation credits that are calculated on the basis of the 39 per cent company tax rate being channelled through later balancing companies to be subsequently credited at the 49 per cent company tax rate. This amendment will ensure that franked dividends paid by early balancing companies during the period between 1 January 1989 and the day on which the amending Act receives royal assent will be subject to the same requirement as those paid on or after the date of royal assent. This amendment will prevent any revenue loss that might arise if royal assent does not occur before 1 January 1989.
       </para>
       <para>
        The second amendment will omit part 4 from the Bill. Part 4 proposed an amendment of the sales tax law to give effect to a proposal announced by the former Government on 20 August 1981. The proposal was to ensure that where overpaid sales tax had been passed on to others, refunds were available only if all persons to whom the tax was passed on had been recompensed. It has become apparent that the proposal would place an unacceptable compliance burden on certain wholesalers and retailers and for this reason the Government has decided not to proceed with this amendment. I commend the amendments to the Committee.

         —The proposed amendments put forward by the Government simply highlight the Government's gross incompetence. There are a few other words to describe it, too. The first amendment seeks to ensure that an amendment in the Taxation Laws Amendment Bill (No. 5) will have effect from 1 January 1989 and not when the Bill is given royal assent. The reason for this change is simple. The Government has so incompetently handled its legislative program-and those listening to the Minister Assisting the Treasurer (Mr Peter Morris) will have heard his words of concern about the date that the Bill may receive royal assent-that it is afraid that the Bill introduced in the first week of November will not be passed by 1 January. It is the same administrative incompetence that has forced this chamber to sit today. We do not oppose this amendment to clause 2 of the Bill.

         —The harsh reality is that if the Minister had looked at the line of the Government's legislative program in regard to that sort of amendment he would not be mucking about with us today, changing the date of operation of a Bill. If he could foresee the consequences of his actions he would not be using this amendment. He would have had it applying from a specific date, and that is why this particular measure is going through. But it does give me, on behalf of the Opposition, the opportunity to bring into the full light of day what is a legislative shambles in terms of drafting, preparation and seeing through measures in this Parliament. There seems to be no stopping the continuing stream of badly drafted and ill-considered legislation for the Government. It was only a matter of weeks ago that the Attorney-General and Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Lionel Bowen) introduced some 290 amendments to his own piece of legislation.

        The second amendment that the Minister has put before the House will strike out the measure restricting sales tax refunds. As the Minister noted, it has become apparent that the proposal would place an unacceptable burden on certain wholesalers and retailers. This is just another example of unintended consequences. The question ought to be asked, `Why was this not foreseen and where was the consultation with business on this matter?'. As I understand it, there was none. The fact is that this Government-which, as I said earlier and have said repeatedly in this Parliament, is the highest taxing government in Australia's peacetime history-simply focused its greedy eye on the higher tax revenue that stems from this proposal.
       </para>
       <para>
        It was obvious that introducing a requirement, as the original Bill did, to force businesses to show that they could pass on sales tax refunds to the ultimate consumer of merchandise would be an administrative nightmare. Also, of course, it was based on some ivory towered, detached, inexplicable notion of retailing. It did not take account of the fact that retail prices are determined as a result of a variety of factors, including market forces. Many businesses do not simply price goods on some cost plus mark-up basis. Instead, they are price takers in a competitive market. It is extremely difficult to prove or disprove the level of sales tax, if any, `passed on' to consumers.
       </para>
       <para>
        Under the original Bill it could be anticipated that almost all refund applications would be rejected because the Commissioner of Taxation would never be satisfied that refunds were in fact, or at law, passed on. Again, this was simply a case of a Treasurer and an arrogant Government seeking to steamroll ahead and increase indirect taxes by the back door. Interestingly enough on this question of indirect taxes, when asked by the Australian Financial Review a week ago, `What about consumption taxation which has inherent benefits for savings?', the Treasurer replied:
       </para>
       <para>
        But we are doing that now, through the wholesale sales tax.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is what he said; they are his own words. For all the talk about no consumption tax et cetera, the Treasurer let the cat out of the bag unquestionably with that answer in the interview to the Australian Financial Review.
       </para>
       <para>
        We have an unholy mess in our tax mechanism. Worse than that, Australians with most depressed living standards, with the sheer impact of bracket creep forcing them to pay more and more in tax than has ever been paid over to a government, also face manipulation and normally deceit through the operation of the ramshackled indirect taxation system that we have at present. The Treasurer's words admit the reality that this revenue grab goes on not simply through the more direct means of income tax and the effect of bracket creep, but also with the application of a form of consumption tax. It is insidious consumption taxation through stealth. The Treasurer tried to do the same thing again in tax Bill (No. 5). There was a considerable amount of community outrage on that point. We are glad that the Government saw the light and moved the amendment, which we will not oppose.

        —The Opposition, of course, has no objections to the amendments being considered in the Committee of the Whole. After all, the amendments have to be considered. But it is appropriate at this stage that we put the matter in context and give some consideration for a few minutes to exactly where we are with respect to the War Crimes Amendment Bill 1987. To put it in a nutshell, the Government proposed the War Crimes Amendment Bill and for some months the Opposition has been proposing what it regarded, and still regards, as essential amendments to that legislation.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       It can be said without a shadow of doubt that the Government's reaction to the Opposition's proposal has continually been to oppose the amendments that we maintained were essential and necessary to be made to this Bill. We proposed amendments because we believed quite firmly that if the Bill was not amended, there was within the Bill scope for enormous potential injustice to be done to defendants. We maintained and we still maintain that it is necessary for this Bill to be amended so that those accused of war crimes will, in fact, have a fair trial.
      </para>
      <para>
       What the Government did was to put its head in the sand and reject the Opposition's amendments. Only at the end of the day, when it had no room to manoeuvre at all, did it very grudgingly accept some, but not all, of the Opposition's amendments. Indeed, it is true to say that not only did the Government grudgingly accept our amendments only at the end of the day, but also we must put on record that the Government adopted the strongest possible position that it could have against accepting the Opposition's amendments.
      </para>
      <para>
       During this debate it may be appropriate at some stage to refer to correspondence that I and my predecessor, the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith), had with the Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen), in which the Attorney-General said that under no circumstances would these amendments be accepted. He resorted to the loftiest propositions in support of his case that the amendments could not be accepted. It is appropriate to say that when it became apparent to the Government that it had no room to manoeuvre at all in the Senate, it grudgingly, at that late stage, accepted some of the amendments proposed by the Opposition.
      </para>
      <para>
       It should be said, so that those who take an interest in this subject know what happened, that only yesterday and the day before was the Government prepared to put onto the statute book a piece of legislation which we and many people in the outside community maintained and still maintain has within it scope for great injustice to be done to people charged with offences under it.
      </para>
      <para>
       One must also conclude that the Government's conduct and behaviour have been quite reprehensible, not only in the general and broader sense, which I have described, but also in respect of a number of incidents that have occurred while this Bill has been before the Parliament. I want to give a few brief illustrations of the way in which the Government has been engaging in the most reprehensible conduct while this legislation has been before the House of Representatives and the Senate. We need to bear in mind that this Bill potentially puts many people's liberties at stake.
      </para>
      <para>
       Firstly, the Government established the Special Investigations Unit to assemble evidence and conduct further inquiries following on from the Menzies Review of Material Relating to the Entry of Suspected War Criminals into Australia to see what credible evidence there was against people whose names were on the various lists which had been thrust into the hands of Mr Hayden and other Ministers as they made their imperial progress around the globe at vast expense. The Special Investigations Unit was set up to investigate these particular allegations and to see what evidence there was against particular individuals.
      </para>
      <para>
       I made the allegation some time ago that the Special Investigations Unit had, in fact, been interrogating, interviewing and questioning suspects-not just that it was collecting evidence, not just that it was marshalling the evidence that was available and not just that it was progressing the work of the Menzies committee but that it had, in fact, been interviewing and interrogating suspects and potential defendants who may be charged under this Bill if and when it becomes law, as apparently it will.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government made a considered response to that very serious allegation. That response emanated from the mouth of advisers in the Attorney-General's office, presumably with his knowledge and approval-if not expressed, then certainly implied. The reaction that came from the Attorney-General's office was that this was `absolute nonsense'. They were the words that were used. In other words, I had said, `Here is the Special Investigations Unit which, contrary to all principle, contrary to the whole way in which law and justice are administered in this country, is going around the country interrogating suspects who might be charged under a Bill even before that Bill has been passed by the Parliament and before it has become law'. What was the response of the Government to that allegation? It said, `It is untrue'. Not only did the Government say, through the Attorney-General's office, that the allegation was untrue, but it was described as `absolute nonsense'.

        —How many did they interrogate? This has become clear only in the course of the Senate debate on this legislation. It appears now that not simply, as I had thought, two or three suspects have been interrogated or interviewed but that up to 30 people have been quizzed by agents of the Special Investigations Unit, some of whom are seconded officers of the Australian Federal Police.

       I would have thought if there was any principle in the administration of law and justice that was clear beyond doubt it is that officials, whether they are in the Special Investigations Unit or any other law enforcement body, have no right whatsoever to go knocking on the doors of citizens or residents of this country and saying to them, in effect, `Under a law that might be passed by this Parliament, but which has not yet been passed, you may be a criminal and I intend to interrogate you about that'. These officials had no right to be interrogating or interviewing suspects who might be guilty or who might be charged under this Bill. In the course of the Senate debate it was said that this conduct was unAustralian. I agree with that remark, although I would express my view in much stronger terms and say that it was completely outrageous in the first place and that it was even more outrageous for the Attorney-General's office to deny that it was being done.
      </para>
      <para>
       I believe that two things have to be resolved about this matter. Firstly, we have to resolve under whose instructions these interrogations were conducted and by what right it was thought they could be conducted. The second thing that has to be resolved is what has happened to the records that the Special Investigations Unit has collected in the course of its investigations. That second matter is important for this reason: Senator Tate, the Minister for Justice, said in the course of the Senate debate, `Yes, it is true, 30 people have been interrogated as suspects, potential defendants under this law, if and when the legislation is passed, and some of them have been given a clean bill of health and will not be prosecuted if the Bill is passed'. Despite the fact that they will not be prosecuted, the fact remains that the Special Investigations Unit has records on them. It has records of interviews taken of them. The Special Investigations Unit also has records of the conclusions which it has reached. We say that that material should be shredded. In our system of democracy, in our system of law and justice which we thought was maintained by this Government, there is no warrant at all for any government agency to be keeping records of interviews and responses of people to allegations that have been put to them when, in fact, what has been revealed as a result of those investigations and inquiries is that no offence at all has been committed by these people.
      </para>
      <para>
       We say that the Government should take this matter in hand; it should get those records and have them shredded. Not only is there a great danger to the civil rights and liberties of the individuals themselves but also there is a great danger to the civil rights, liberties and reputations of their children in the future. If this material is not destroyed, those people will forever and a day have a black mark against them, a record in the office of the Special Investigations Unit and, for all we know, in the records of the Australian Federal Police that they have been interrogated and investigated by law enforcement officers. There is no answer to this; there is no defence to this. The Government must have this material destroyed and it must announce publicly that it has done so. If the Government does not do that, it will be rightly condemned for taking one more step-several steps have already been taken in the course of this whole matter-towards administering this country as a police state.
      </para>
      <para>
       I hope that the Attorney-General will take these matters on board. In addition, I hope he will find out what warrant people in his office had to say, when I made my allegation, that this was absolute nonsense. If the defence is that I used the word `interrogation', let me remind the Attorney-General, those in his office and those in his Department, that the word `interrogation' means to ask questions. Any lawyer knows that; any citizen knows that. What was being alleged was that before the Bill was passed by the Parliament, these people, who had committed no offence at all under Australian law, were being questioned. If the Attorney-General needs the assistance of the dictionary definition I will give it to him: `interrogate' means to ask questions. There was a serious and sustained attempt by the Attorney-General's office, by those advising him and those for whom he was responsible, to mislead this country and the media on this issue. I will have some more to say about this and related matters as the debate progresses because the Attorney-General should not assume that these amendments will be simply rubber stamped without any discussion. There is a lot more that must be said about this matter.

        —in reply-Mr Deputy Speaker, I will endeavour to reply briefly because I understand that some other matters have to be interposed. I want to make the point that the honourable member for Menzies (Mr N.A. Brown) was not leading for the Opposition at the time that this matter was debated in the House of Representatives. A number of the amendments now before us were, of course, not moved at that time. I am beholden to the fact that the Senate has clearly indicated that it will not pass the War Crimes Amendment Bill unless certain amendments are agreed to. But we will deal with that at the committee stage.

       I point out that this is a remarkable piece of legislation in terms of the time it has taken to come back to this House. It was sent to the Senate in December 1987. At that time there was notice of a motion by Senator Chaney to refer it to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. That all-party Committee met; it took evidence from Mr Temby and Mr Greenwood; it made the closest analysis of the situation. In no way did it make any criticism of the kind that the honourable member for Menzies has now made. Never at any stage did it ask questions about what was happening. Never at any stage did it suggest that something improper was being done.

        —You did. The honourable member had inferred that Mr Greenwood had no right to be carrying out investigations. He has now said it again. I am telling him that the Senate Committee had Mr Greenwood before it, asking questions about what he was doing. I point out to the honourable member that the report of the Menzies Review of Material Relating to the Entry of Suspected War Criminals into Australia commented on these matters a long while ago-in February 1987. That was when the report and the Government's reactions to its findings were discussed in this House. Let me refresh the honourable member's memory on that. One of his findings was:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       It is more likely than not that a significant number of persons who committed serious war crimes in World War II have entered Australia and some of these are now resident in Australia; certainly the likelihood of this is such that some action needs to be now taken.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Opposition and everybody else said, `Yes, this is very important'. We had a bipartisan approach at that time. What has happened since? The only thing that has happened since is that the honourable member for Menzies has assumed the mantle of believing that there is something wrong with the whole conduct of the investigation. I point out that the Menzies report recommended that the Special Investigations Unit be set up. It then outlined the basis on which that unit should operate. The report recommended that the unit should:
      </para>
      <para>
       . . . make preliminary investigations of the remaining cases listed . . . as appropriate for investigation . . .
      </para>
      <para>
       Honourable members should bear in mind that the list was prepared by Mr Menzies. I have never seen it; it was handed to the then Special Minister of State, Mr Michael Young. The recommendation continued:
      </para>
      <para>
       This investigation would encompass requesting evidence from overseas countries-
      </para>
      <para>
       the honourable member should listen to this point; I think it is relevant-
      </para>
      <para>
       and providing an opportunity to the suspect to answer the allegations . . .
      </para>
      <para>
       I repeat those words: `providing an opportunity for the suspect to answer the allegations'. The recommendation continued:
      </para>
      <para>
       At the conclusion of this investigation, the unit would, through the Director of Public Prosecutions, report to the Attorney-General . . .
      </para>
      <para>
       That is, as to the position of the suspects. That is not inconsistent when compared with the Nuremberg Charter. Article 15 of the Nuremberg Charter proposes that, in matters under investigation, the chief prosecutors shall collect and produce all necessary evidence and have a preliminary examination of all necessary witnesses and of the defendants. To this end, we adopted the Menzies recommendation to have an investigations unit because a number of allegations could be made against people who were completely innocent. The first task of the unit relates to identity. So it was not set up on the basis of examination and cross-examination. In many cases I understand, as a result of some interviews, people have been completely exonerated from the allegations. Honourable members should bear in mind that the list was pretty substantial. It started off with 70 cases and a number of allegations have been made since.
      </para>
      <para>
       At this stage of the debate I wish to put at rest the suggestion that this legislation was always wrong. This legislation has always been right in terms of dealing with war criminals. We have had to accept the views of the Senate because the Bill has been there for more than 12 months. The proposition was put to me that, unless I could come to some sort of an arrangement, the Bill would never be finished with in the Senate. I am sure that might delight some people, but in relation to the principles of dealing with war criminals we must realise that we have accepted the Menzies Review report. In the second reading debate in this House we accepted the Menzies proposals.
      </para>
      <para>
       What has happened since, other than the two factors which resulted from the Senate Committee hearings? Senator Hill and Senator Stone said they would not be satisfied with the evidence that might come from the Soviet Union. I accept that; nobody is going to be satisfied with evidence coming from the Soviet Union. We have made it very clear that-and we are the only country in the world to do so-if we go ahead with trials, it will be on the basis that they are normal criminal trials in accordance with the procedures in Australia. In other words, there will be committal proceedings and if we bring any witnesses from overseas they will be subject to cross-examination.
      </para>
      <para>
       The alternative would be to have extradition arrangements-where Germany could ask for some of these people to be extradited and sent back. In that case there would be no question of a trial because we have treaty obligations. So here we are, trying to set up properly an opportunity for people to get justice-and no other country has done that-and we find that this remarkable attitude has now developed among Opposition members since September of last year. That was when the honourable member for Menzies wrote to me and asked whether I would accept certain amendments. I had to tell him that in certain circumstances I could not. Those amendments were never canvassed, never foreshadowed, never even mentioned in the second reading debate. So I give credit to the fact--

       Correspondence from the Opposition has always been along the lines, `We support the thrust of the Bill and we support the concept of dealing with war criminals', yet Opposition members are now adopting every possible attitude of antagonism. It amounts to vilification of those who have responsibilities in this area. The Menzies report suggested a Special Investigations Unit. That was welcomed by the Opposition. It is very clear that, in the conduct of its work the Unit has to ask whether there is any evidence. Is there some verification? Is there some method of identification? Can the suspect rebut the allegations? They frequently would, should, and can; and that might be the end of the investigation. Does the honourable member seriously suggest that, because the allegations have been made, the suspect should not be given the opportunity to comment on those allegations? I think not.

        —Yes. The Special Investigations Unit was set up and if the honourable member looks at the report of the debate-and I do not know whether he participated in it-he will see that it dealt with the question of what should be done about that unit. He will see from the Hansard report that everybody supported it and said it was a good idea. The honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Spender) said that. On that basis the unit had to be set up because Menzies had already recommended it. He said that unless there was some investigation, we had to look at it from the point of view of whether it was worth while talking about the issue. The honourable member for Flinders, when he was in charge of the matter, said `How long is the investigation unit going to remain?', and I said, `About two years'. That appears in Hansard. Almost two years have gone by in trying to get the Bill from the Senate.

The honourable member is so sensitive, so vindictive, that he cannot address his mind to the issue here. Why did he write correspondence saying he supported the thrust of the Bill? I listened to the debate in the Senate and it was very clear that the Opposition would be happy if this Bill were not proceeded with in any shape or form. The Opposition has taken a hypocritical attitude in suggesting that it wants to deal with the issue that has been thrust upon this country of people coming here and allegedly being guilty of crimes committed elsewhere. That is the genesis of this situation.

      </talk.start>
      <para>
       Let us not walk away from the issue. There are no politics involved in this. It is a question of Menzies in an independent report making it very clear that he is convinced that a number of people have entered this country who could well be guilty of war crimes and that we would need to investigate that matter. Never at any stage did he say, `You had better bring in the legislation before we talk about investigation'. That is very clear in his recommendation (3) (b), where he states, `You had better first see whether there is evidence and, when you get that evidence, at least give the suspect an opportunity to talk about it'. So the suspect is shown in advance what is deemed to be the evidence, and in many cases suspects have been able to rebut and refute the validity of the evidence or the identification. That is the point that is at issue here.
      </para>
      <para>
       The honourable member should address his mind to the fact that it was the Menzies report that suggested, in keeping with article 15 of the Nuremberg Charter, that we should at least talk to the suspect. We should not just go ahead and charge people in a blinkered fashion. I make the point again that the investigation should encompass requesting evidence from overseas and providing an opportunity to the suspect to answer the allegations made against him.

         —On behalf of Madam Speaker, I draw the attention of the House to the fact that the Senate amendments conveyed by this message include a purported amendment which raises an issue of constitutional significance. The third paragraph of section 53 of the Constitution stipulates that the Senate may not amend any proposed law so as to increase any proposed charge or burden on the people. By its purported amendment No. 2, the Senate resolved to omit proposed paragraph 12 (3) (b) of the Bill, which alters part of the formula for providing grants to the States for approved courses provided by non-government business colleges.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I am advised that this amendment removes an element from the calculation which is used to determine payment to the States for these purposes. This removes an important limitation on grants that may be made and thus may be said to increase the proposed charge or burden on the people. The question arises whether the alteration proposed by the Senate should have been by request and not by amendment. My task, as the Deputy Speaker, is to alert the House to this matter. It is for the House to decide the manner in which it will deal with the purported amendment.

        As indicated by the statement read by Deputy Speaker McLeay, these amendments would have the effect of increasing expenditures. Therefore, it is not properly within the competence of the Senate to move these propositions as amendments. They should, indeed, have been requests. But, even if they had been requests, the Government would have been constrained to oppose them in any event. I will read from the Acting First Parliamentary Counsel's advice that we received in relation to this matter. The Acting First Parliamentary Counsel writes:
       </para>
       <para>
        I confirm my oral advice that in my opinion amendment No. 2 of the Senate amendments, which omits paragraph 12 (3) (b) of the Bill, is an amendment which `increases any proposed charge or burden on the people'-
       </para>
       <para>
        that is the end of the quotation from the Constitution-
       </para>
       <para>
        and therefore, by virtue of section 53 of the Constitution, may not be made by the Senate. Furthermore, it seems to be that the amendment is one which, under section 56 of the Constitution, should not be passed unless the purpose of the appropriation has in the same session been recommended by message of the Governor-General to the House in which the proposal originated.
       </para>
       <para>
        For that reason, which is a very serious constitutional reason, the House cannot agree to this particular amendment.
       </para>
       <para>
        But there are more important issues at stake here as well. One is that once again the Senate is seeking to overturn a measure which the Government decided to embrace in the context of the May statement and has given effect to in the Budget itself. The point is that we, in the context of our higher education policy, agreed that for post-secondary institutions-those dealing with post-secondary education-we would not be providing direct support to private institutions or non-government institutions. The Government's intention was to withdraw over time or to phase out the subsidies which are currently provided to non-government business colleges. One of the difficulties here is that some non-government business colleges were receiving subsidies while others were not, and we had to decide whether we were going to make this consistent in terms of providing a subsidy to all students of non-government business colleges or to withdraw them.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the context of the large expansion in the higher education system, our continuing support for TAFE and so on, we decided that it was not appropriate for the Government to be providing these subsidies in the non-government area. In order to ease the phasing out of this particular proposition, we also agreed to provide something like an additional $1.5m to support those students who had been given an indication prior to Budget time that there would be a subsidised place for them. This was done in the context of negotiations with the association representing these non-government business colleges. And, of course, that was provided for in the Bill.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Senate's amendment is to remove these phase-out proposals and, in a sense, to maintain the subsidies for these colleges-something which would cost in 1989 alone in the order of $5m, and then, of course, in subsequent years a similar or larger amount. This takes us back to the debate we had earlier, on the States Grants (Schools Assistance) Bill. Not only is it not constitutionally within the Senate's competence to propose measures which will increase the burden on the taxpayer, but also it flies in the face of what the Opposition has said time and time again, that is, that it will not use its position in the Senate to play around with, to disrupt, or to disorganise the Government's Budget measures in a way which will increase expenditures or otherwise increase the burden on taxpayers.
       </para>
       <para>
        So, again, we have this very clear instance where the Opposition really cannot be running around the country, on the one hand, saying that it believes that expenditure ought to be cut and that the Government is spending too much money and then on the other hand, when this measure comes along, engage in the folly of in fact withdrawing an expenditure reduction proposal that the Government has decided upon. It is for those reasons, therefore, that we reject this amendment, this unconstitutional amendment agreed to by the Senate. We hope that when this matter returns to the Senate it will realise the error and allow the Bill as first proposed by the Government, at least in relation to this particular passage or section, to proceed.
       </para>
       <para>
        The important thing is that for as long as this Bill is held up as a result of disagreement between this House and the Senate, the hundreds of millions of dollars that we wish to provide to the TAFE system, to the States for the support or recurrent costs of the TAFE system and the capital costs of the expansion of the TAFE system, are thereby held up. That is the result of the failure of the Senate to pass this particular measure. We hope that this matter can be speedily resolved and that the measure can become law so that early next year we can begin to pay the amounts to the States in order to support the TAFE systems throughout the country.

         —I listened with interest to what the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) had to say about the constitutional aspects of this piece of legislation. He cited a legal opinion as his basis for continually saying that the legislation as it has been returned to the House is unconstitutional. I just point out that we can, of course, have a variety of legal opinions on matters that will differ one with the other and it may very well be that a different lawyer looking at the same set of facts, the same piece of legislation, the same amendment, would come up with a different conclusion. That raises the question why it was that this matter that the Minister has just referred to was not picked up in the Senate. If it is such an important matter, if this is a question of the abrogation of our Constitution, one would have thought that the Senate, with all its advice and with its lawyers, would have picked the matter up.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I just say to the Minister, since he is holding out a small piece of political blackmail by saying that if the Bill does not go through all the hundreds of millions of dollars for technical and further education (TAFE) will be held up, `If you are satisfied that that aspect of the Bill is unconstitutional, let the Bill go through as it is and the Government can test it in the courts'. If the Government tests it in the courts and that aspect is unconstitutional, then the TAFE colleges will have their money and the non-government business colleges will not have their money.
       </para>
       <para>
        We reject the Minister's assertion that the basis for disagreeing with the Senate's amendments is a constitutional one. I have had a significant number of representations over the last few weeks from non-government business colleges about their funding. Although it may be true that the Minister has had discussions with representatives of non-government business colleges, it was on the basis of what had already been decided in the May statement. The Government had decided that it was going to cut the funds. The discussions were not about whether the funds should be restored. The Government had made a decision that it would cut the funds. The discussions were about the extent to which there should be some kind of alleviation of those cuts.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Minister refers to discussions with the representative body of the non-government business colleges, but he does not tell the Committee-and he should have done so-that it was a different basis on which he was having those discussions from the one to which he has alluded today. This is just another example of the Government's trying to corporatise control of education. It does not like those non-government business colleges. There are a lot of them and they are small. With these many disparate groups in our community, it is very difficult for the Government to do what it wants to do-that is, to centralise bureaucratic control over the whole education process. We see that in what it is doing with schools. A terrible brawl has broken out between the Minister and the Minister for Education in New South Wales, which has been the subject of comment in the Australian newspaper a couple of times in the last few weeks. It is obvious that what the Government is trying to do is to centralise complete control of all aspects of secondary education throughout Australia. The New South Wales Government, for very good reason, is taking exception to this endeavour. The Government is trying to do the same in higher education. A matter which will come before the chamber a little later today concerns educational profiles. The educational profiles that it is seeking to impose on higher education institutions are simply the Government's way of saying to those institutions, including universities and colleges, `This is what we want you to teach'. In forcing amalgamation of higher education institutions by putting together larger and larger blocks, the Government is making it easier to corporatise education. It is easier to control larger and larger blocks than it is to control small groups. That is one reason why the Government has really got it in for the non-government business colleges. It is a way of trying to complete the process of introducing the corporate state in education. It is a way of belting the private sector because this Government has always been suspicious about the private sector, and particularly suspicious about small groups such as the non-government business colleges that are out there performing a service for our community. It is the Government's way of making sure that all control in education is centralised, not only in advisory groups to which the Minister might have access but also right in the palm of his hand in his office here in Canberra.

       <para>
        So, we reject what the Government wants to do with non-government business colleges. We reject the corporate state in education. We reject this further belting of the private sector. We reject what the Minister is trying to do in order to have complete control of education in his hands. What the Senate has asked for-and we concur with what the Senate has asked for-is the same level of support to the non-government business colleges as existed before the May statement. I should say, Mr Deputy Chairman, that we are dealing here, in many cases, with some very old established institutions. The Metropolitan Business College in Sydney, for example, as I understand, has been going for over 70 years. It is something with which my family had some connection; my father used to lecture there just after the Second World War. These are very well regarded institutions. They provide a very valuable service for the community. They provide a service particularly for women who are seeking training in secretarial courses and in stenography. Why the Government should be singling out these non-government business colleges and singling out women in particular is really quite beyond me.
       </para>
       <para>
        We reject the constitutional argument that has been put forward by the Minister. We invite the Minister, if that is on his mind, to let the Bill go through and test that aspect in the courts. We reject what the Government is trying to do with non-government business colleges. We reject, as part of this whole scheme, the Minister's attempts to centralise control of all education here in Canberra.

       </para>
       <para>
        These two Senate amendments were inspired by the Australian Democrats. They relate to the proposed scrutiny by the Employment and Skills Formation Council of the National Board of Employment, Education and Training with respect to resource agreements between the Commonwealth and the States in relation to the funds that we provide to the States for the purposes of supporting TAFE colleges around the country. We believe that it is unnecessary and probably inappropriate for an advisory body of this kind to be involved in a detailed way in the negotiation of resource agreements between the State and Federal governments. It is quite appropriate for governments to negotiate between each other about the expenditure of Commonwealth dollars in State government institutions. Indeed, this year, 1988, we had a very successful experience with the negotiation of resource agreements to provide precisely for this purpose.
       </para>
       <para>
        What the resource agreements allow us to do, in a sense, is to ensure that our priorities-national priorities, if you like-and State priorities are pursued in the context of training for our current and future work force. Therefore we think that it is inappropriate for this Council to be involved in the approval of those resource agreements. It would mean that there would be an advisory body essentially capable of upsetting an agreement that had been struck between the two governments. We do not think that is an appropriate role for the Council. In relation to amendment No. 4, we are prepared to accept that there is a general proposition that the Council should be able to inquire into and, from time to time, report on the operation of these resource agreements. For that reason, we have moved an amendment to give effect to that intention.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is not much more that needs to be said about this matter, but it might be said that there are again some technical defects with these proposals. Indeed, in amendment No. 1 there is a reference to the wrong year in relation to the operation of resource agreements. In amendment No. 1 there is a reference to the so-called Education and Skills Formation Council, which should properly be called the Employment and Skills Formation Council. We have taken the opportunity to improve on the Democrats' amendments in this area and therefore make it operable in relation to the general monitoring of the resource agreements in regard to TAFE, but we do not agree with that part which would require this advisory council to scrutinise those agreements before they come into effect.

The Minister has referred a couple of times this morning to technical defects. I want to make the point very briefly that technical defects are not the sole preserve of those who are not in government. I point out to the Minister that these Bills went through the Senate last Wednesday and the Government still could not get its act together this morning, a whole week later, and as a result had to defer discussion on the two items that were shown in the second and third messages from the Senate. In summary, the Opposition takes no exception to what the Government proposes.

       <para>
        The amendment removes an element from the calculation which is used to determine payments to the States for approved courses provided by non-government business colleges. This removes an important limitation on grants that may be made and increases the proposed charge or burden on the people and is an infringement of section 53 of the Constitution.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government decision to phase out the subsidy to non-government business colleges was based on the consistent application of the Government's policy on the development of and support for private tertiary institutions as set out in Higher Education: A Policy Statement. The Government was also concerned at the inequitable nature of the scheme which applied only to a limited number of institutions and a restricted range of courses.

        This is very much like the arrangements that I mentioned in relation to the previous matter. We are accepting that the appropriate council of the National Board of Employment, Education and Training should have a monitoring role in relation to the operation of educational profiles and in relation to the operation of the higher education contribution scheme. These amendments were proposed by the Democrats with, I think, some assistance from the Opposition parties. Rather than approving them precisely in the form which they came from the Senate, they have been redrafted to improve their clarity and to remove yet another technical deficiency which existed in the amendments as they came to us. But, in terms of the principle of there being a monitoring role for the Higher Education Council, the Government accepts this in order to ensure the speedy passage of this measure.

        —Prior to lunch the honourable member for Deakin (Mr Beale) raised a question as to whether the Committee of Reasons which was set up in relation to the rejection of certain Senate amendments to the States Grants (Technical and Further Education) Assistance Bill had failed to give reasons for the House not accepting the Senate's amendment No. 1. I have to inform the House that there was a misunderstanding on this matter and the honourable member was correct in believing that a reason should be given in respect of the rejection of amendment No. 1. I ask leave of the House for the reason to be now read by the Clerk.

       Senate amendment No. 1 is not acceptable because:
      </para>
      <para>
       The proposed additional powers for the Employment and Skills Formation Council (ESFC) run counter to the Government's objective in establishing a unified and modestly resourced advisory structure with the National Board of Employment, Education and Training (NBEET). The additional reporting activity proposed for ESFC will create demands for substantial increased administrative resources over and above the level currently provided to NBEET.
      </para>

       The amendment also reduces the flexibility of the arrangements the Government was introducing for Commonwealth funding of TAFE, and would make administrative processes complex and potentially delay the payment of grants to the States.

        —With your indulgence, Madam Speaker, I point out that both the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) and the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) this morning made much of some alleged technical defects that had arisen in amendments that came back from the Senate. It being Christmas I do not want to make too much of the point, but it is obvious that what we have here is sloppy work by the Minister and his Department. It is a further illustration of how arrogant, out of touch and incompetent that mob opposite is.

        This amendment relates to the substitution of the preamble. The new preamble refers to issues that Mr Menzies dealt with in respect of those people who committed, or are alleged to have committed, crimes in Europe and who came to Australia. It refers to the safeguard that if there were to be trials in Australia they would be held in the ordinary criminal courts of Australia. Also, it outlines that all safeguards would be available to defendants in Australia-namely, matters such as the gravity of the allegations and the lapse of time since the alleged crimes would be taken into account. The Senate felt that this preamble should be inserted. The Government agrees and I accept the amendment.

         —As the Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen) has pointed out, this Government amendment, which is the first of a series of amendments from the Senate, proposes that a preamble be inserted into the War Crimes Amendment Bill 1987. That preamble sets out a number of provisions which, in substance, the Attorney-General has explained to us. What the Attorney-General has not explained to us, and what I am sure everyone reading the Hansard would like to know, is exactly why the Government proposed this amendment. As the Attorney-General has given this House no explanation as to why the preamble is to be inserted into the Bill, it may be helpful if I explain to the Committee exactly why I understand the Government is proposing it.

         —Indeed, as my colleague has suggested, perhaps I could explain it to the Attorney-General. I will do so in this way: an argument has arisen with respect to whether the War Crimes Amendment Bill should apply to Australian ex-service personnel. The Opposition has consistently maintained that the Bill should not. We have argued that the War Crimes Amendment Bill, and the machinery for setting up and conducting war crimes trials in this country, should not apply to Australian ex-service personnel. We have maintained that all along and we maintain it even more strongly today for a particular reason which I will outline in a moment.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        We have maintained that this Bill should not apply to Australian ex-service personnel for two reasons: the first is that the Government has always maintained that the reason why we need this war crimes Bill at all is that there are in Australia people who are, in substance, guilty of serious war crimes. However, the Government goes on to say that there is no system of law which can be used to bring them to trial. As a result of that, the Government says, it is necessary to have a new and separate law which will retrospectively confer jurisdiction upon the Australian courts so that these individuals may be brought to justice and may be forced to stand trial within this country.
       </para>
       <para>
        As I have said, the underlying proposition behind all of that is that there is as yet no Australian system of law which governs those individuals and the dreadful acts that they committed. Therefore, it is now necessary to pass a new law and to apply it retrospectively some 45 years. There are arguments, of course, about the wisdom of adopting that retrospective method of legislation, but we will leave that to one side for the moment.
       </para>
       <para>
        Our point is simply this: those Australians who were members of the Australian armed forces were subject to a system of law. A system of law applied to them during the Second World War. There is, therefore, no need to subject them to this new retrospectively created structure of law which turns the clock back 45 years. That is the first reason.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is a second reason why we say that the Bill should not apply to Australian ex-service personnel. The Government has told us over and over again that there is no intention to prosecute any former members of the Australian defence forces. It is a good principle to make one's legislation say what one wants to achieve, to make it say what one wants to do. For that reason, we say: if the intention is that there should be no prosecutions of former Australian service people and if there is no ground for prosecuting any of them, which the Attorney-General maintains, what is the earthly point of having a Bill of such an enormously wide ambit which covers Australian ex-service personnel?
       </para>
       <para>
        All of that in one sense is by way of background. The Government, in response to this argument, has said, `We will tell you what we will do: This Bill, when we formally introduced it into the Parliament, applied to acts which were committed in such theatres of war as Europe, North Africa and the Pacific. We will take all of them out with the exception of Europe. We will leave Europe in and exclude all of the other theatres of war'. I do not know why the Attorney-General cannot explain why this change was made.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government says, `Australian ex-service men and women were mostly engaged in the Pacific and in theatres other than Europe. Therefore, we will come half of the way, or part of the way, and we will change our Bill so that it will apply to Australian ex-service men and women who served in the armed forces in Europe during the war but it will not apply to those who were engaged in activities in the Pacific and in other theatres'. We accept this change because it is all right as far as it goes. But it goes nowhere near the distance it should go. It should exclude all Australian ex-service personnel. If the Government had an ounce of humanity and commonsense about it, it would do exactly that.
       </para>
       <para>
        We say that what the Government has done is make the situation worse than it was initially. It has now created two classes of Australian ex-service personnel-those who served in Europe and those who served in the other theatres of war apart from Europe. The Government is saying to ex-service men and women in this country, `If you served in Europe then for the rest of your lives you will be at risk of being charged under the War Crimes Act'. The Government is going to leave Australian ex-service personnel who served in Europe subject to that risk for the rest of their lives. Is it any wonder that members of the Returned Services League and other people outside this Parliament have expressed their concern and outrage at what the Government is doing? It is utterly reprehensible for the Government to rectify the problem which we highlighted by creating two classes of Australian ex-service personnel, which is really worse than the original situation. We support this amendment to the Bill because it goes part of the way and it acknowledges our concern.
       </para>
       <para>
        Another matter of equal concern about this preamble is the sloppy mumbo jumbo which the Government engages in. The preamble commences with the words:
       </para>
       <para>
        WHEREAS:
       </para>
       <para>
        (a) concern has arisen that a significant number of persons who committed serious war crimes in Europe during World War II may since have entered Australia and become Australian citizens or residents.
       </para>
       <para>
        It introduces the notion of serious war crimes. The preamble will be used as one of the parts of this piece of legislation to interpret the rest of it, because the Acts Interpretation Act says that it can be used for that purpose. So the Government has introduced this notion of serious war crimes. But serious war crimes are not even covered by the Bill. The Bill deals with war crimes. And war crimes are defined as `serious crimes', which are themselves defined as being such `if they were committed during the war'. That is what the Government's war crimes are. It has always had trouble working out what it is on about in relation to war crimes, but the definitions in the Bill are definitions of serious crimes which were committed during the war. Into this preamble the Government has brought this new notion of `serious war crimes'.
       </para>
       <para>
        This will give the courts-which will have to interpret this legislation when it becomes an Act, as it will-an additional problem, a new headache. They will ask, `What on earth did the Government mean by ``serious war crimes''?'. Does it mean that when people are prosecuted for war crimes which are less than serious they will not be entitled to a fair trial or to any of the other lofty propositions in the preamble? That is absurd. It is hopelessly sloppy drafting and the Government should be utterly ashamed of the way in which it has drawn this preamble and inserted it into the Bill. We support it as far as it goes, but the reality is that the Government has created two new major problems. The first is in interpretation of the Bill by the courts, because there is now this notion of serious war crimes, which is not the expression used in the Bill itself. The second problem relates to the fact that the Government has reprehensibly created two classes of Australian ex-service personnel.

      </para>
      <para>
       In doing so I wish to say a little about those two amendments together. They involve no departure in principle and, although we believe there are administrative faults and difficulties with them, the Government is prepared to accept them. Honourable members will be aware that when this Bill was debated in this place the Government sought, amongst other things, to limit Medicare access to persons who have a legal entitlement to remain permanently in Australia and to exclude visa overstayers, illegal immigrants and the like from Medicare eligibility. I am sure that there would be general agreement in the chamber on that point.
      </para>
      <para>
       However, the Bill which is now returned from the Senate also proposes the insertion of a new subclause (e) in section 7 (b) to add the definition of `Australian resident persons' who, in the opinion of the Secretary to the Department of Community Services and Health, are likely to be granted an entry permit for permanent resident status following an application based on territorial asylum, family connections in Australia, refugee status, an authorisation to work in Australia or compassionate or humanitarian grounds. We believe that there are some real administrative difficulties with this proposal, which was supported, I might point out, by both the Opposition and the Australian Democrats in the Senate. For instance, it imposes on the Secretary to the Department a task of double judging the issue of the decisions made in an entirely different department. But, given the way the Senate behaves these days, these are the sorts of oddities that emerge from it.
      </para>
      <para>
       However, I wish to point out that already most of those problems are dealt with by the substantial discretionary power already possessed by the Minister, and indeed I believe the discretionary power would be able to be applied to these rather confusing amendments. I believe it would have been much better to have left the Bill as it was and to have left those discretionary powers with the Minister. Moreover, the new clauses seem to address situations which, to date, have never been brought to my notice under those discretionary provisions, so the extent of the concern is doubtful. I have certainly undertaken to meet the representatives of the Federation of Ethnic Community Councils of Australia with a view to resolving any problems in this area.
      </para>
      <para>
       Having said that, we will accept this amendment with reluctance, but I will also indicate that it is likely that in the not too distant future we will have to correct some of the problems that arise from it.

        —In responding to this debate on the Community Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2), I must say that this is another sad reflection on the manner in which legislation is introduced into this place and then pushed through the Senate to the exhaustion of senators who have been sitting for the last four weeks. When this was originally dealt with in the House of Representatives, I think we were allowed one hour's debating time as a result of the guillotine motion. Of course, the issue of Medicare did not receive the complete endorsement of this House, and we did not get the opportunity to examine and debate the legislation fully. I must say that many people in Australia are complaining very bitterly about Medicare. To use a medical term, Medicare is bleeding the health system of Australia. The health system is literally bleeding through lack of funding and lack of Government support.

       It is interesting that while the Government is prepared to accept these two amendments, on the other hand it says that it is not sure what the amendments mean. These amendments extend the Medicare categorisation to another five cases, which are, I think, listed within the amendment itself. If there is a suggestion that the next amendment changes expenditure, I would suggest that these categorisations themselves would increase costs to the Government in some respects. The Senate agreed to these amendments on a vote of 42 to 30, and at this stage the Opposition will go along with them.

      </para>
      <para>
       The previous amendments have just received a fascinating defence from the honourable member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite). Certainly, the Senate had plenty of time to consider in detail these measures and in this case it came up with a rather peculiar amendment. The first two amendments did not apply to principle nor, despite the claims of the honourable member for Dawson, do they have any significant financial effects. As I have indicated, we are not aware of particular cases covered by those categories, so the financial effect is minimal, if not non-existent. However, amendment No. 3 clearly attempts to reverse or deny the Budget policy of the Government.
      </para>
      <para>
       In the 1988-89 Budget Speech the Treasurer (Mr Keating) said that the Government had:
      </para>

       . . . painstakingly sifted through Commonwealth outlays, attacking waste and setting priorities.
      </para>
      <para>
       In Budget Paper No. 1 the Treasurer indicated:
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government has decided that the Health Insurance Act 1973 will be amended in 1988-89 to remove Medicare benefits in respect of services provided overseas, saving an estimated $5m in 1988-89 and $6m in a full year.
      </para>
      <para>
       Last night in the Senate, the Government attempted to achieve the objectives laid down in the Budget presented to this Parliament. The result, however, was that the Senate rejected the amendments to the Health Insurance Act designed to discontinue the payment of Medicare benefits for medical services provided overseas. In fact, what the Opposition has done in the Senate is to effectively overturn a Budget decision. Budgets, as the more responsible members of the Opposition would realise, are based on setting priorities and ensuring that groups deserving of the greatest financial support receive it.
      </para>
      <para>
       There is an important principle here. The Government is responsible for setting the financial framework for government expenditure through the Budget and it is not proposing to abrogate its responsibility in this area to the Senate. I would be very interested indeed to see those apostles of financial discipline and Budget responsibility, such as the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) and the shadow Minister for Finance, the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), taking a position that the basic budgetary framework can be undermined in this particular way. We admit that the cost of the Senate rejection of the proposed amendments is not large in relative terms-some $5m per annum. But that $5m per annum will have to be found elsewhere in the portfolio. While the Opposition in the Senate seems to be keen to protect Medicare benefits for a few Australians who travel overseas, the result of that decision, the result of its refusal to accept the budgetary framework laid down, may well be that other much more needy Australians will suffer.
      </para>
      <para>
       So, first of all there is the issue of principle -that in making a Budget one has to make a number of tough decisions. If those decisions can be just rejected by the upper House then, of course, what we have is the destruction of effective budgetary responsibility in this country. That is the principle involved, even though the amount of money might be relatively small. I think that the senators also ignored the intrinsic virtue of the decision that the Government made, because they did not seem to realise that travellers who become ill and require medical treatment while overseas-or, even worse, hospitalisation-are personally responsible, even under the present system, for the often very high costs involved.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government's position, explained very clearly to the Senate and to this House, is that it is more appropriate to remove the confusion relating to the application of Medicare overseas by removing what is really a token payment in relation to medical treatment. We intend to develop a larger network of reciprocal health agreements and to encourage travellers to purchase adequate travel insurance. At the moment too many people go overseas believing that they are covered adequately by Medicare. That is not so, because Medicare cannot cover hospital costs overseas and it certainly cannot meet the cost of medical and hospital treatment in places like the United States. We believe it would be much more appropriate for those travelling overseas to adequately cover themselves through systems of private insurance which are available at relatively low cost.
      </para>
      <para>
       The result of continuing the present uncertainty is that unfortunately many people will travel overseas and then be landed with very heavy burdens which are not covered by a Medicare system primarily designed to care for people here in Australia. Of course, we already have in place a policy to begin to deal with the overseas problem. We now have reciprocal agreements with the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Italy and Malta, and more are planned. Over 30 per cent of Australians travelling overseas visit the four countries with which we already have reciprocal agreements. We think that is a much more effective way of protecting Australians overseas. When they go to a country both their medical costs and their hospital costs will be covered where we have a reciprocal agreement with that country. Of course, we hope even during the course of this year to spread the range of these agreements.
      </para>
      <para>
       Apart from abrogating the principle of the budgetary responsibility of the lower House, the Senate has in fact ensured the continuation of confusion in the minds of Australians travelling overseas concerning the extent of Medicare cover and the real need for additional comprehensive travel insurance. Over the past 12 months or so I have attempted to ensure that the travelling public is better informed as to the need for comprehensive travel insurance which includes overseas health cover, in addition to the limited Medicare cover which applies for medical treatment overseas. But in spite of all those attempts made by the Government it is a fact that some 50 per cent of Australians travelling overseas do so without any form of insurance cover. The decision made by the Government in this matter would at least have made it much clearer and made it much easier to get the message across that travel health insurance is a prerequisite for people travelling overseas. It is therefore for reasons of principle and also the intrinsic merit of the Government's changes that we reject amendment No. 3 as proposed by the Senate.

        —It is very interesting to hear the Minister for Community Services and Health (Dr Blewett) talk about principles. In the case of the first two amendments apparently the principle of disagreeing with the Budget allocation is okay because of its minimal effect. He did not quantify it; he says that it may not have had any effect. But the fact that it could have had some effect means that if a proposition comes up before the Senate it is at liberty constitutionally, according to this Government, to alter it for a small amount but for a large amount that liberty is not available.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       It could also involve the principles of a Budget Bill. In this House we have had the Treasurer (Mr Keating) lay down the Budget forecasts and predictions, and already the major indicators are well below what is actually going to happen. On the balance of trade, for instance, by the end of November we had almost reached the 12 months figure estimated by the Treasurer at Budget time. The inflation figure is well off the target in the Budget. As to the exchange rate, maybe the Minister can tell me how close we are to predictions. The people exporting on the primary market and the secondary market are finding that their goods overseas are not selling as well as they might have because of that grave difficulty.
      </para>
      <para>
       Talking about a matter of principle, I also mention what the Minister has said. It is okay by this Government for people going overseas to insure for their medical costs while overseas; yet the same principle denies the Australian people the opportunity to cover the gap between the amount expended on medical expenses and what they get back through the miserable pittance of the Medicare refund. Where is the principle in that? If we go overseas we can insure for the full cover. If we are in Australia we cannot cover the gap. Of course the members of the Government who are still here are stunned by that revelation, because they never thought of it. One can go to a medical practitioner now and on the schedule of fees for a $25 visit one might be lucky to get a $15 refund. Where is the principle that the Minister is espousing? There is none whatsoever. What the Government is doing in this situation is giving the status of Australian citizenship two categories: one if people stay at home, so that they can be fleeced by the system of having to pay that $10 difference between the doctor's fee and the schedule fee; and the second category, people who can go overseas, because if they can afford to go overseas it is expected that they can afford also to pay for the insurance cover. But if they get sick overseas they do not belong to that category of Australians that can be covered.
      </para>
      <para>
       The argument that we put forward is that there are many groups of Australians who travel overseas in a situation which is vital to Australia's interests. For instance, there are those people who study overseas to acquire a skill and bring it back for profitable use in Australia and to the benefit of all Australians and of this country of ours. We are addressing those people who are trying to further their own ends by studying overseas and giving Australia an enhanced level of skill. There are also organisations such as Australian Volunteers Abroad. I would be the first to suggest that those people who are working overseas in a voluntary capacity, in Ethiopia or other countries, are there doing a job for Australia. It is the extension of goodwill from Australia to those countries. Yet they too are going to be denied the right of Medicare cover. I would not like to think what the cost would be to cover a person in a country such as Ethiopia, where obviously the health standards are a lot lower than ours. Those people are in the second category.
      </para>
      <para>
       There are people who are overseas on what we might call an almost involuntary basis, such as people who are working overseas for Australian companies trying to further Australia's trade ends in those areas. They are also going to be asked to cover themselves. There are also the bona fide travellers who go overseas. They do not all travel first class. They are not like the Ministers of the Government who travel overseas. First class travel is not always available to them. There are many people who use their hard earned savings to make such a visit. They are going to be faced with a situation of not being covered, in those overseas countries, unless it is by reciprocal agreements-and maybe they have forgotten to which countries they can travel and be covered by those agreements.
      </para>
      <para>
       In all of these cases, we have genuine Australians who are now going to be put into a second class category. It does not do the Minister's argument much good when he says that in practice there is little more than a token payment against these very high costs. I have already explained that that is the situation in Australia. The Medicare benefit is only a token recognition of the cost of those services, both medical services and hospital services. That is borne out by the fact that the payment is so token that the hospital queues are so much longer these days, at the same time as the private hospital system is being sent to the wall by this same program.
      </para>
      <para>
       We have a fundamental commitment. We do not believe that a principle can be adapted in the Senate to allow small expenditures over the Budget, yet the Government can espouse this high principle of not altering a Budget commitment. If it is good enough in the case of the first and second amendments, it is also good enough in the case of these. We are trying to establish `One Australia', not a divided Australia as this amendment would lead to. In fact, those people who are overseas for genuine reasons need the protection of the law and our Medicare system as much as those people who stay here. We still oppose the Government's position.

        —Let me reply to what the honourable member for Menzies (Mr N.A. Brown) has said. While supporting amendment No. 1, he has raised one or two issues, such as why we would use the expression `serious war crime'. I make the point that this is a preamble and it is an expression used in the Menzies report. In the findings, Mr Menzies talks about a number of allegations that there have been people who have committed serious war crimes.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       He goes on to say that in 1957 information was sought from the United States and that was unsatisfactory, to say the least, and therefore there should have been more efficiency in relation to the information that might have detected people coming to Australia. What the preamble is trying to do is to say that, as the investigation unit has been in operation for some time now and bearing in mind that nobody in this House disagreed with the findings of the Menzies report, it is now pretty clear that the findings or allegations pursuant to those findings would relate, if at all, to the European theatre of war.

       I understand what the honourable gentleman was saying when he asked, `Why is the Government doing it this way?'. I am able to tell him that, because of the extraordinary delay and difficulty in dealing with the matter in the Senate, it was thought that we could make it clear in the preamble that the matters obviously result from the allegations and investigations in relation to Europe. It was thought, wrongly as it turned out, that the Opposition would have agreed to that and that would have helped the Bill get through the Senate. It did not. As it turns out, the Opposition did not accept that position.

       The Geneva Convention clearly shows that we cannot exempt people on the basis of nationality. That is the issue. The honourable gentleman did not advert to that in his argument. The difficulty always will be that, if we are to talk about accusations of criminal acts, we cannot exempt them on the basis of nationality. The honourable gentleman does not agree with me on that, but that is the basis. The international convention says that there are to be no exceptions on the basis of nationality. There are no exceptions here either. There happens to be the definition of a geographical area from which allegations have been made. It is still right to say-and I support what the honourable gentleman has said as I said it myself first-that there are still no allegations against any Australian ex-service men or women. But we cannot legislate on the basis that accusations can never be made against certain Australians. Accusations are being made against people who came to Australia. That is clear. That is the result of the investigations carried out by the unit. So, we are not in conflict with the international principle by saying we are excluding people on the basis of nationality-not at all. If the honourable gentleman wants to do that, that is why I cannot agree with him. I hope that explains the situation.

        —I wish to make our position clearer on the first of the two points to which the Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen) has just addressed himself. The second of the two points is an argument on which it will probably not be very fruitful to delay the Committee by pursuing the matter further. I want to make a point about the first of the two issues. Perhaps I should start off by saying that I would certainly, on behalf of the Opposition, make the genuine offer to the Government that, if it now wants to change this expression `serious war crimes' in the preamble to `war crimes', or some other such expression, whichever honourable members wish, it should simply propose another amendment here and now-provided that there is power to do that, and I presume that there is-and we will accommodate it.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       I say that before going to the argument because I genuinely believe that, by including this expression `serious war crimes' in the preamble, the Government is building up trouble in the interpretation of this Act, as it will be carried out by the courts. There are enough problems associated with this legislation without manufacturing more problems. When in the preamble the expression `serious war crimes' is used but in the body of the Bill the expression `war crimes'-not `serious war crimes'-appears, that difference of expression really is asking for trouble because the court will look at the preamble, if there is any confusion about this Bill.
      </para>
      <para>
       Let us face the fact that every point is going to be taken in these trials. We all know that. We know that now. There will be a lot of point taking, and a lot of legitimate point taking. One of the arguments that will be advanced is that the Parliament's intention, as seen from the preamble, is that those on trial for serious war crimes should be given a fair trial, because that is what the preamble says. It will also be argued that one of the matters that will have to be taken into account in a trial, because the preamble says so, is that there should be particular regard given to matters such as the gravity of the allegations and the lapse of time since the alleged crimes. This will become, as a matter of practicality, tremendously important.
      </para>
      <para>
       I would imagine that it is common ground that, in some of these trials, the defence will apply for a stay of proceedings. It will apply for a stay of proceedings on the ground that too much time has passed by, so much time in fact that it is an abuse of process for the trial to proceed and that so much time has passed by that witnesses have died or their recollections have become faded in the mists of time, or witnesses have not been able to be found or documents have been lost, et cetera, et cetera, et cetera. That is what the argument will be.
      </para>
      <para>
       In the course of that argument, the court will have to interpret what the intention of the Parliament was. When the court looks at this Bill, it will have regard to the preamble. It will have regard to the preamble for this reason: the Acts Interpretation Act says that the court may have regard to:
      </para>
      <para>
       . . . all matters not forming part of the Act that are set out in the document containing the text of the Act as printed by the Government Printer.
      </para>
      <para>
       Now I concede, if I can remember my rules of statutory interpretation, that it is true that the preamble is not part of the Act, but it is had regard to. It is given regard to by the court as an aid to interpretation as to what the Parliament thought it was on about.
      </para>
      <para>
       When the court looks at this preamble and sees the expression `serious war crimes', what will it conclude about this concern about a fair trial? It will conclude that these concerns about a fair trial, the lapse of time since the alleged crimes were committed and the importance of getting a fair trial only apply to serious war crimes and not to other war crimes which are not so prescribed or felt to be serious. After all, the Bill refers to crimes other than murder. It does not confine itself to murder; it goes on from murder through manslaughter, causing grievous bodily harm, wounding, rape, indecent assault, abducting or procuring for immoral purposes, conspiracy to do those things, attempting to do those things, attempting even to conspire to do those things, if we please, after 50 years, which is going to make an interesting trial, but that is a side issue. The point is that the court will probably say that, because the Parliament has listed a whole series of offences here and has used this expression `serious war crimes' in the preamble, it was referring only to murder or perhaps murder and manslaughter, and perhaps even going as far as causing grievous bodily harm. It is clear beyond argument, I would have thought, reading this Bill, that what the Bill does is create war crimes and war crimes are serious crimes committed during the war. Serious crimes are defined, expressly. So, there is no such offence in the Bill as a serious war crime. Yet, suddenly, it pops up in this preamble in a most confusing way and in a way which is calculated to lead the courts to great doubt, we would have thought, as to interpretation of what the Parliament's intention was. I simply end by saying, as I did at the outset to show where I was proposing to go: if it is within the powers of this Committee at this stage to amend this provision, why does not the Government do it? It should simply say `war crimes' and not `serious war crimes', and we will all know what the Government's intention was and what the Parliament's intention was. We will all be better informed, even if no wiser.

        —I do not wish to delay the Committee, but the issue relates to this definition. The honourable member for Menzies (Mr N.A. Brown) says, `You should not be talking in the preamble about serious war crimes as such; you ought to be talking about war crimes'. He argues a strict legal definition. The Act itself does not advert to that. But I disagree with him for this reason: section 6 deals with what the heading describes as `Serious crimes'. Certain acts are serious crimes. The acts it talks about are those matters of murder, manslaughter, causing grievous bodily harm, wounding and rape, et cetera. There might be some argument in a court whether such a crime is serious. The Menzies report referred to what are called `serious war crimes', and I think that is what we are about here.

      <para>
       The honourable gentleman must agree with me that I cannot do anything about the fact that the Second World War ended in 1945; that lapse of time has taken place. War crimes are still being recognised across the world. Canada has now legislated in the same way as we have for the very obvious reason that perhaps-I say `perhaps'-people who are in Australia and who as Menzies said may have done so in circumstances that were somewhat doubtful, might have entered other countries. It possibly could be argued that, if they had remained in Europe, they would have been dealt with by now. I think the honourable gentleman argues very forcibly, even though he does not appear to say so directly, that perhaps we should abandon the Bill because 45 years have elapsed and there is nothing we can do about the effects of that. The world takes a different view.

        —Of course it is. But, if the honourable member puts the argument on a broad basis, everybody can argue the lapse of time concept. The allegation whether it is serious is a matter of judgment. Menzies exercised that expression. This legislation adverts to the fact that the crime must be deemed to be serious. I listened to a debate in the Senate in which very much the same argument was put as the honourable gentleman is advancing. Are we to be concerned about murder or are we to be concerned about mass murder? Are we to be concerned about rape or are we to be concerned about multiple rape? Are we to be concerned about causing grievous bodily harm or do we mean mutilation and experimentation? All those elements come into what we might call a subjective judgment as to the situation. That will clearly arise in any accusation that will be the subject of a charge. Particulars will need to be given. But it does not support the honourable gentleman's argument that there is no definition of serious crime.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       Serious crime is defined in section 6 as being serious. It is also defined in section 7 by the words `a serious crime as a war crime'-those are the words that are used there. Also in section 6 (4) we read `Each of the following is a serious crime'. I know full well that good counsel-and there are plenty of them-are going to argue very effectively that as 45 years have gone by their clients will be placed in difficulty. They ought to win on that basis. The problem the Government has-I think the Opposition recognises it but does not want to say so-is that there may be people in Australia who, despite all the difficulties presented by the 45 years time lapse, have evidence and witnesses to produce who can be cross-examined and who will say that something rather horrific happened. That is a matter for the judgment of the courts. It is not for us in Parliament to be saying, `Look, you are really going to run into a lot of difficulties in the courts'. I will accept that argument. But we would not be starting trials, I would not think, unless we knew we could overcome the difficulties and the defence was given every opportunity to defend itself. It is not everybody who is going to be the subject of a trial. Many of them have obviously died. Many of them are perhaps unable to stand trial.
      </para>
      <para>
       The issue we are dealing with here is our international obligation. The Opposition throughout the debate, which has now gone on since February of 1987, has said that we ought to do something about the fact that Sir Garfield Barwick said in 1960. `The cases are now closed'. We would all be happy to accept that situation. But, of course, the Menzies report says that he did not get the right information. We were misled in 1957. The departments did not have the right information. So, we are grappling with the situation that the rest of the world has been able to deal with, particularly Europe. War trials are still taking place there. I mention France in particular. The Canadians are now dealing with one and have had to pass special legislation. The British are now passing special legislation. We are all in the same time frame now. We are passing legislation to cope with matters that certainly could have been dealt with in the 1940s. I hope that the honourable gentleman understands that that is the basis of what we are now saying.

       That amendment No. 2 be agreed to.
      </para>
      <para>
       Amendment No. 2 relates to what is deemed to be the period of war and specifically to the occupation. There was argument that the Baltic states were not at war, but were subject to occupation. There was argument, also, that whoever might have been in government in those states accepted the Soviet Union into those states. Certainly, in 1941, they were invaded because of what was called the Ribbentrop agreement. What we are saying here is that we will accept the view that there could well have been accusations made by people in Australia against others who are here and they would relate to that occupation. What we are now talking about here, by way of this definition, is that occupation means, in summary, the Baltic states. That would result from that agreement of 23 August 1939.
      </para>
      <para>
       It is acknowledged that there was no military invasion. But those people certainly were not assisted when there was a Soviet intrusion in the middle of 1940. There was certainly an invasion in 1941. Rather than argue the issue, we are now agreeing that, as a result of the agreement of 23 August, there was an occupation. There were certainly major troop movements in June 1940. Rather than having a definition that might exclude a period commencing in 1941, this provision overcomes the submissions made on behalf of the Baltic states.

        —I am reminded that this was done after a lot of procrastination and I think, with respect, that is an understatement. There was not only procrastination but downright opposition to this amendment from the Government in the first stage. In fact, it is interesting to reflect upon the fact-and those who have a sense of history will appreciate it-that we put all of our amendments to the Government and, amongst the correspondence, the Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen) wrote back to me on 21 September of this year and, dealing with this particular amendment, said:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       As to the Opposition's proposed amendment concerning occupation, I simply say that the annexation of the Baltic states was not a war by any principle of international law.
      </para>
      <para>
       Let me repeat that: it was not a war by any principle of international law. So what was, in September, a proposition that it was contrary to international law to adopt this amendment and proposal and put it into the War Crimes Amendment Bill, by December becomes something which, in fact, is so worthy of merit, so valuable an amendment and addition, that the Government itself moves the amendment and proposal and has the Senate pass it. We congratulate the Government on seeing the light at long last. We hope that in the future we will not be subjected to the same obfuscation and obstruction when we have sensible and reasonable amendments. Even though the Government's concession can really be described as a capitulation, nevertheless we acknowledge that the amendment makes an improvement to the Bill. It is for that reason that we accept the amendment.
      </para>
      <para>
       It must also be said that the reason why the Government rejected this amendment in the first place and continued to reject it for months and months until only a couple of days ago was that, believe it or not-you will find it hard to believe this, Mr Chairman, I know-the Government's assessment and view of what happened in the Baltic states after the Nazi-Soviet pact in 1939 was that the Baltic states actually invited the Soviet Union to come in. They were not invaded; the Soviets were invited to come in. I can see that you are surprised at that view having been held, but that was the view expressed by the Attorney-General.

        —People who migrated to this country from Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia should remember three things about the present Government. Firstly, its predecessor recognised the incorporation of the Baltic states in the Soviet Union. They will never forget that, and there is no need for me to remind them of that.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       But there are two additional things that one should remind people who migrated to this country from the Baltic states. The first of them is that the Government actually believes and promoted the view originally that after the Nazi-Soviet pact in 1939 the people of the Baltic states rose like one man and asked the Russians to come in, actually invited them to come in and occupy their country. Can you imagine that, that that is the world of reality? Of course it is not; it was an invasion pure and simple, and it is very unfortunate that the Government, even at this stage, does not acknowledge that.
      </para>
      <para>
       The second thing that those people should be reminded of is that the Government, until it was forced into a corner and forced to accept this amendment, was not prepared to have subjected to the War Crimes Amendment Bill those horrific and horrendous acts and atrocities committed against the people of the Baltic states by the Soviet Union. Now they are subject to that Bill, and that is progress; but we find it very difficult to give the Government any credit at all for having proposed this amendment.

There was war all around in that sense, but there was no declared war between Germany and the Soviet Union until June 1941. The honourable gentleman can express surprise, but I have no doubt that we would all be surprised if somebody invited somebody else to come in. In fact, there was in place a puppet government which purported to do that, and did so in about June 1940. They are the facts. The actual declaration of war took place in June 1941, but we accept the view that as war was around them and as they were the subject of occupation we should let the matter be dealt with in this way. Quite frankly, from the point of view of a strict definition of `war', we were facing that problem.

        —The Opposition accepts the amendment; but, as the shadow Attorney-General-the honourable member for Menzies (Mr N.A. Brown)-has already said, we do not believe it goes far enough. The effect of this amendment will be that there will be two classes of veterans in Australia. As the Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen) knows, there will be those Australians who served with the Australian forces in Europe, apart from those who served with allied forces, and those who served elsewhere. I find it inconceivable, given all the difficulties that this Bill has aroused, that the Government would deliberately set out by not excluding Australians who served in Europe to make it so much more difficult for those who served during this period. I had, I think, five phone calls last night about this issue. The callers were saying to me, quite rightly, `I volunteered to serve the country. I was sent to Europe. Those who were not sent to Europe-who served in the Pacific and elsewhere-are now off the hook as they will not be liable under this Act. Through no fault of mine, I served in Europe'. However remote the possibility that they will be caught up, these people-some of them are quite elderly now-feel that this is a shadow hanging over their head.

I speak for a lot of concerned ex-servicemen. The Government has made the situation worse. It took the view that it would not exclude any Australian servicemen. Now it has taken the view that it will exclude the majority, but some who served in Europe will be still liable under the Bill. All served their country under the same Australian military orders and regulations. Now some of them, in the latter years of their life, are going to be caught up under this shadow.

       I want to deal now with a matter which has not, as far as I know, been mentioned at all during this rather extensive debate; that is, the effect of the War Crimes Amendment Bill on people who are now serving in the Australian Defence Force. Many of them are very concerned about the attitude the Government has taken towards those who served in the past. If they are required, as they will be one day, to go into operations in Fiji, Vanuatu or New Guinea or in a major conflict, the question in their minds will be whether the Government is going to stick with them or whether at some time in the future, given this precedent, it is going to catch them up in some similar retrospective legislation.
      </para>
      <para>
       What sort of effect is that going to have on the attitude and morale of a young soldier who sees all this going on, who sees a government determined to catch servicemen some 40 years later and who is suddenly dispatched, as happened last year with the troops sent to Fiji? Going through his mind will be the question of how safe he is going to be in carrying out orders in any operation that he might be committed to. It is having a very serious effect on current servicemen. I am sorry that the Minister for Defence (Mr Beazley) is not here, because he would be very much aware of that. Whether he has made representations to the Attorney-General, I do not know. That is a matter for both Ministers. But the fact is that the Government's attitude to the War Crimes Amendment Bill is having a very serious effect on men and women currently serving in the Australian Defence Force. It is entirely understandable why they would be concerned if they were committed to operations, given the attitude of the Government.

The honourable member knows that this matter was not raised in the debate in this place. I think everybody accepted the view then that we were dealing with horrendous accusations against non-combatants. I think that is the position. I go on record as saying there are no allegations against Australian ex-service men and women. I am writing to them in that way. But we cannot pass a law which says that war criminals in Australia who served in the forces have to be exempt. We cannot do that because the Geneva Convention says that we cannot exclude anybody on the basis of nationality. No other country in the world has done it. Canada's legislation does not provide for any exception. Britain does not do it. Nobody in the world does it because of that prohibition.

        —It is interesting that the honourable member for Menzies keeps interjecting, is it not? He interjects all the time. He does not want to hear the argument. The real issue is what would happen if we said, `We are going to exempt Australian ex-service men and women'. The Japanese have already been to see us on the basis of saying, `Listen, are you trying to make out that you have got somebody here you are trying to protect?' That is the problem. I say no to that. I have no problem at all. But then we see programs of the sort that have been encouraged by the attitude that the Opposition has the credit for adopting. That happened in September. The Opposition was the first one to think of it.

        —The honourable member can say what he likes; it is in writing here. He was the first to propose that we exempt them, and I can understand why. It is a valid argument. But he was the first to do it after the Bill left this chamber. I do not think we can win this argument with ex-servicemen, but for the sake of their peace of mind let us make it very clear: Menzies had specific allegations. He did produce a list of 70. There were no Australian ex-service men and women on it. It will not come up. But if the Opposition wants to exempt from this legislation all ex-service men and women, I do not think anybody in the world will accept the validity of this legislation. People are going to ask: `Does that mean that although we might have an accusation we cannot raise it any more?'. No other country in the world has done that, but the Opposition wants to put Australian service men and women in the dreadful position that some of them might be guilty, but we have to exempt them. Those opposite should face up to the fact that these ex-service men and women were very honourable; they did nothing wrong. The accusations are being made against people who were part of a group of Australian ex-service men and women. This is the Opposition's problem and it has to think about it. No matter how many letters I may write, we have the accusations being made-some of these people have even been named on a television program which could be sold to Japan-about people who were fighting for this country, brave as they come. People would say to me, `Well, what do you think of that, Mr Attorney? You have some war criminals here'. I cannot say, `What are you talking about? We were flat out in the middle of a hostile action'.

       Our people were engaged in active combat. They were not going around concentration camps carrying out mass exterminations. The Opposition knows that. I say to the Opposition that, no matter how we argue it here, we have lost sight of the fact that there are 850,000 of them. Members of the Opposition may laugh. They think it is great. They were the first to do it; they should get the gold award. They did not do it in the second reading debate. That was a smart move.

        —The views I wish to put on this amendment are those I expressed in different words in the earlier debate we had before lunch. There is no need to go over it again in detail. I simply want to make the point that the Opposition's very firm position always has been, is now and will remain that this Bill should not apply to Australian ex-service personnel. The reality of what has happened in this case is that that argument was advanced by us. It was raised first not by me, I should say-the Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen) wants to give me credit for it-but I am happy to promote that view because I believe very strongly in it. It was in fact raised before the Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       It came to us, or at least it came to me, from ex-servicemen and their associations, whose attitude to the Government's position on this matter can be described only as one of outrage. They are outraged and they will continue to be outraged because the Government is saying two things to ex-service men and women. It is saying, `Although there are no allegations against you at the moment, you will so far as we are concerned, if you fought in Europe, remain for the rest of your lives at risk-not that you will be charged, but that you will be at risk of being charged under the War Crimes Act, when this Bill becomes an Act'. The second thing the Government is saying to Australian ex-service personnel is simply this: `With respect to those of you who served in theatres of war other than in Europe, you will be exempt, but with respect to this other group who took part in the war in Europe, you will remain subject to it. You will be at risk'. That is what the Government is saying to the ex-service men and women of this country.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government should not come along here with this nonsense that it is prevented by some lofty principle of international law from drawing a Bill which will not have the effect of applying to Australian ex-servicemen. It has just done that. It was made perfectly clear in the Senate and in the debate outside the Parliament that the Government was in a corner. It knew the difficulties of proceeding with this Bill when, on its terms, it applied to all ex-service personnel. The Government was in a difficult corner. It knew that it was losing the debate. So what did it do? Instead of coming out and accepting the Opposition's proposals to make the Bill more sensible, the Government said, `Oh well, it looks as if most Australian ex-service personnel took part in the war in theatres other than in Europe, so we will excise that part of it. We will leave Europe in'.
      </para>
      <para>
       We say that that was an underhand and deceitful way of going about it and does not get the Government off the hook. It says it has international obligations which prevent it from amending the Bill in the way in which we say it should be amended. It has already done that by limiting the operation of the Bill to events that occurred in Europe. What the Government has done is typical of what Senator Stone described in the Senate as the hocus-pocus that the Government has engaged in with this legislation from beginning to end. Members of this chamber who were not following the details of this debate in the Senate may not know what the Government proposed to do originally. It proposed originally to amend the Bill-and it put this on paper in the Senate-so that it applied only to events in Europe, and then kept the time sequence up to October 1945. Believe it or not, that is what it did. Then when Senator Hamer pointed out to the Government that the European war ended in May 1945, it needed another amendment. It had already limited the Bill in terms of geographical operation but had not amended it in terms of time. It now comes along here and amends it in terms of time as well as geographical operation, and still goes on with this hocus-pocus, as Senator Stone described it accurately, that one cannot devise a Bill which will have the effect of not putting Australian ex-service people in jeopardy.
      </para>
      <para>
       Is it any wonder, Mr Chairman, that today bodies which have spoken against this Bill in various forms have maintained their opposition, despite the amendments the Government proposed? For instance, the Returned Services League this morning, in a statement by Brigadier Garland, its President, said that this was `a slap in the face by the Government'. That is what it is-a slap in the face by the Government and by the Australian Democrats to ex-servicemen which will be felt at the next election. They will not need us to tell them what the point is. They know, because they are telephoning us and writing letters to us expressing their outrage at what the Government is doing.
      </para>
      <para>
       My attitude to the Government's performance on this Bill, I must say, is coloured by this outrageous statement that was made in Question Time some weeks ago when, the Committee will recall, the Attorney-General had the gall to say that I had accused Australian ex-servicemen of war crimes because they were involved in the bombing of Dresden. That is what the allegation was, and he repeated it again today. He nods again now. When I interjected to say `Where did this happen?', he said, `In my office. You came to my office'.

Seeing that he has lifted the veil on this matter, I feel obliged to draw it to the attention of the Committee. We did have negotiations and the Attorney-General made a number of points. Firstly, he rejected our amendments; secondly, he expressed his personal opposition to the War Crimes Bill-he is utterly opposed to it-and then said, `No-one is going to be charged under the Bill and if anyone is charged I hope they get bail and nick off'.

       Coming back to the point, Mr Chairman, we support this amendment because it goes part of the way along the road of the very sensible changes that we say should be made to the Bill. It does not go the whole distance, and it should. In the course of proposing this amendment what the Government has done is to create two classes of ex-service men and women. The veterans' community in Australia should understand that the Government has created two classes: those who served in Europe, who will be subject to the War Crimes Bill and may be prosecuted; and those who did not, who have now been let off the hook. That is an insult and an outrage to the ex-service and veterans' community in Australia, and should be condemned for what it is.

        —Yes, and one thing that happened in the Senate, after the Government had been pondering over this Bill for months and months, was that suddenly over the dinner break it thought up another amendment. So it said, `Whiz this down to the Opposition, and it can try it for size'. The Opposition was forced to give hasty consideration to the amendment, and it supported it with some reservations. Senator Hill and other colleagues of mine in the Senate said how typical this was of the way in which the Government had handled this whole piece of legislation. The Government writes me letters-so frequently that it boosts the revenue of Australia Post-saying, `No, we won't accept any of your amendments', and then when it gets into a corner it decides it has to capitulate and dress up its legislation with all sorts of lofty nonsense and highfalutin principles to cover the situation. In reality it has been cornered and has had to find some way of getting out of its problems and on occasions, such as with respect to this amendment, it dreams it up over the dinner break.

       When I say that we have some reservations about this particular amendment, I mean that there has been, during the conduct of the preparation of this legislation and its promotion, a number of departures from very basic principles of the administration of law and justice. This, unfortunately, is one case which has the potential for creating another departure from the way in which we administer law and justice. In fact, it will give legislative support to what is known as duplicity in indictments; that is to say, where you dress up two or three or more charges and pretend that they are really one, and enable by that means the prosecution to have an easier ride than it otherwise would because it can get in bits of evidence which it would not have been able to get in had there been only one single charge.
      </para>
      <para>
       So what we are saying now, after the Bill is amended, is `Right, we have a War Crimes Bill and one of the war crimes we will have will be a double-headed one, a triple-headed one, a four-headed one, or a multi-headed hydra, and this will make it easier for a prosecution to get a conviction'. The reason I say that is that I do not think it is literally correct, as the Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen) said, that the Director of Public Prosecutions had brought this problem of mass murders and how to prosecute them to the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. In fact, I think if we read closely what Senator Tate said in the Senate, it appears that the Director of Public Prosecutions is already getting up a prosecution. It seems to me, from reading what Senator Tate had to say, that the Director of Public Prosecutions was having a bit of trouble in framing the indictment to give him a reasonable chance of getting a conviction. So before the Bill even gets through the Parliament-and this is the problem we have about the way this Bill is drafted-there are problems in administering it and applying it.
      </para>
      <para>
       So we simply say this: we support the amendment but we warn the Government not to go too far down this path of dressing up indictments in such a way that it is going to make it easier for the prosecution to get a conviction than it would normally in a typical case. That is one departure from the accepted way of doing things.
      </para>
      <para>
       The other departure, of course, and I repeat it, is that the Special Investigations Unit has been questioning suspects, potential defendants, before the Bill has been passed by the Parliament and at a time when what the suspects had allegedly done was not contrary to Australian law and not subject to the jurisdiction of the Australian courts. The Attorney-General said this morning in this debate that there was no need to worry about that, that they were just talking to people and those people were baring their souls. The fact that they have two Australian Federal Police officers standing over them, of course, is no inducement to unburdening themselves. But the Attorney says, `It's all right; don't worry; these investigations and inquiries are conducted perfectly properly'.
      </para>
      <para>
       Let me tell honourable members about one such investigation, very briefly. It involves a case that I have mentioned before in public. I am not going to table this document or incorporate it in Hansard, but I have a record of interview of a poor man who had been visited and interrogated by two officers of the Special Investigations Unit. I am not going to read from it because I do not want the man identified but I invite the Committee to see that I have here a record of interview-and my colleagues confirm that I do. It is headed `Australian Federal Police'. What does that record of interview reveal? It reveals that the two police officers, or at least the two agents from the Special Investigations Unit, interrogating this man, before the Bill has been passed by the Parliament, actually refused to give him copies of the two documents which they were questioning him about and which contained the allegations against him. Is that where we are going in the administration of law and justice in this country?
      </para>
      <para>
       Before the Bill is passed, without any legislative authority, we have officers and agents of the Special Investigations Unit knocking on people's doors, saying `Come on; it does not matter whether the law has been passed or not, we are going to ask you questions about allegations here in two documents-which we are not going to give you copies of, so you will not be able to let your lawyers have a look at them and you will not be able to follow it up later'. I would hope that is not where we are going, but because of the lax and slack way in which the current Government administers law and justice in this country, particularly in this case, that would seem to be the way we are going, and we in the Opposition say that we oppose this method of doing business and we will not let this matter rest until we have found out who has been giving this advice that this conduct was legitimate. We certainly will take whatever action we can to bring it to an end.
      </para>
      <para>
       I repeat the point I made this morning: some of these people quizzed by the Special Investigations Unit have been given a clean bill of health, according to Senator Tate, as a result of the investigations but the Special Investigations Unit has still got their files. Senator Tate says their files have been closed. They have not been charged with anything, they will never be convicted of anything, but the officers of the Special Investigations Unit have interrogated them and keep written records, and the file-it is almost as if the file has a capital F-has been closed and is presumably in the records of the Special Investigations Unit.
      </para>
      <para>
       We say, as we did with the information that was illegally obtained before the Australia Card Bill was dropped, that these records should be shredded, they should be destroyed, and if they are not it is a step towards a police state. That is no exaggeration. If the police are able to keep files on people when no offence has been committed and no charges will be made against them, but there is a record, it will be a step towards a police state. If the Government has an ounce of self-respect left about this matter it should have those files and records destroyed immediately. Of course, the other aspect of the departure from normal principles, I say again, is that outrageous conduct by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in going around the country saying, `These people to be charged under the War Crimes Bill appear to be guilty'. That is what his words were. He branded them in public, with all the weight and authority of his office. What sort of way is that for a Prime Minister to conduct himself? It is absolutely appalling and disgraceful. How on earth people are going to get a fair trial out of this Bill I do not know, when we have the Prime Minister of this country saying that about some of them.
      </para>
      <para>
       So, coming back to this amendment, we say that the amendment has potential for another departure from the normal way in which law and justice is administered in our sort of country and we would urge the Government to watch this very closely indeed to make sure that it is not used by the authorities to give them an unfair advantage over the defence and to enable them to obtain a conviction when in normal cases, on normal principles, they would not.

        —Again, we support this amendment. This is an amendment which the House will be interested to know contains the Government announcement that the European war ended on 8 May 1945 and not 29 October 1945. It is unfortunate, perhaps, that the Government was not gracious enough to thank us for drawing its attention to the fact that the European war ended on 8 May 1945. If it were not for us we would have had a Bill confined to the European war but having its effect on acts which were committed after the end of the war in reality and indeed up till October 1945. So we say, once again-it is something that can be said about almost every provision in this Bill-that there has been sloppy drafting and sloppy supervision. One really wonders who was in charge of drawing up the Bill and advising the Government on this matter from beginning to end.

        —We are not opposing the amendment. I doubt, frankly, whether the amendment really does say what the Attorney-General just said that it says. In fact it proposes to leave out proposed paragraph 9 (1) (b). Paragraph 9 (1) (b) provided that, subject to definitions, what one did in committing a war crime made one guilty of an indictable offence against this Act if, amongst other things, one did it within or outside Australia. As I understand it, both of those provisions are being taken out. If they are both being taken out I have an interesting question to raise. I am not asserting this as being correct; I simply raise the question: if we are taking that out and the court looks at this Bill as a whole, why is it going to assume that the Bill deals at all with war crimes that were committed outside Australia? Why have we taken out the bit about outside Australia, as well? I can understand the Government taking out the bit about events that occurred within Australia. As I understand it, it is talking both out by leaving out the proposed paragraph. I suppose the Attorney will reply that the court has the preamble to aid it in its interpretation, and the preamble refers to Europe. As I have already said, I do not know whether the preamble is going to be very much help. I simply draw the Committee's attention to that problem. We are not opposing the amendment. It is the Government's drafting; if this is what it wants it can certainly have it.

A defendant is being given the opportunity not only to use the law at the time, but also to use any improvements in the law since then. It is on that basis that we have moved the amendment.

        —I repeat the point that we do not want to have people sent outside Australia to face trial. This creates problems with respect to extradition. We said we would deal with these matters in Australia and, as such, this legislation is unique. The honourable member for Menzies (Mr N.A. Brown) criticised me. But this legislation is unique. In contrast, people do get deported from the United States of America. All we are trying to do is give everybody who may have to face a trial the same opportunities as anybody else. Australia is a federation. Does the honourable gentleman suggest that we should have some special code of law that deals with these matters?

        —The only thing we have is delay from the Senate. Some sort of world record has been created. The legislation went to the Senate at the end of 1987. It has been in the Senate for so long that the only person the Opposition is supporting is Senator Stone. The only contribution that Senator Stone made as a member of the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs, that dealt with the Bill, was to say that he was not prepared to accept evidence from behind the Soviet Union. Fair enough. The other day I heard Senator Stone going on, as Opposition senators do-they must love to hear themselves talk once we adjourn here because they realise that somebody may be listening, although there would be very few guilty of that-on the basis of what was meant by murder.

A whole lot of accusations have been made by people who are understandably upset about having seen not one or two, but many people exterminated. Does the Opposition want the language in the Bill to be redefined in such a way that a murder is considered to be all right, but mass murder is all wrong; that a single rape is all right, but multiple rape is all wrong? Let the court judge the evidence that will be given. That evidence, if given, will be pretty substantial because it will be in accordance with the same sort of evidence that has already been given in Germany.

        —The way in which the Opposition has dealt with the amendment now before us is, I think, an indication of how perverse it has been in this debate. The Opposition spokesman, the honourable member for Menzies (Mr N.A. Brown), said that unfairness has been built into this legislation which will ensure, he believes, that people who are charged under the legislation are not going to receive a fair trial. He complains that we have rendered the legislation a hotchpotch by providing all available conceivable defences to defendants. On the one hand, he is saying-and this is the only way we can interpret him-that we ought not do something and then, on the other hand, he says perhaps we should. He accuses us of being in a state of total confusion; but what about that position for starters? The point about the amendment which is being debated is that it maximises the opportunity for the defence.

       Listening to the way in which members of the Opposition have debated this and so many other amendments in this place, one would have thought that they had absolutely no conception or understanding of the sorts of matters that are at issue in respect of war crimes. Absolutely horrendous crimes were committed in Europe during this period. Millions and millions of people were sent to the gallows or were burned in concentration camps. The lives of millions of people were destroyed. Whole countries and whole ethnic groups were destroyed. This is morally irrelevant as far as members of the Opposition are concerned. One of their tricks is to try to cloak these mass murderers in the heroism of Australian armed forces. Now they are trying to cloak their unwillingness to concede the fact that a fair trial--

How unfortunate for the honourable member. The honourable member has a view that only he may speak in this place. On a previous occasion in this chamber, an attempt was made by one of his National Party of Australia colleagues to organise a division. The honourable member for Menzies decided that a division could not be held because he had to be heard. When I come in here to discuss this item, the honourable member for Menzies says, `Oh, this has been discussed for far too long', looks at his watch and says, `How terrible, we are wasting the time of the House'. The honourable member has been well accommodated.

       We are going through this matter amendment by amendment for the benefit of the honourable member; we are trying to discuss these amendments seriously for the benefit of the honourable member for Menzies who has used the liberality that we have permitted on this side of the House to debate these serious matters to the fullest possible extent. So he can just listen to a few explanations from this side of the Committee when the time comes for them to be given. It is relevant to do so in this case because, yet again, he provided an example of the Opposition just slip-sliding away from the critical moral issues involved in this whole debate. Unfortunately, part of that slip-sliding has involved an implicit slander on the honour of Australian servicemen. But now it involves some sort of slander on the honour of the Australian judicial system, which is being utilised by this clause to provide the widest possible defence for anybody who is charged under it.
      </para>
      <para>
       I am sure that if one consulted those people who are likely to be charged and looked at the background of similar trials overseas, one would see a very strong preference on the part of those likely to face justice under the terms of this legislation and similar Acts which are in place elsewhere to be tried under our legal system. For example, the United States is a country which has at least as much regard for due processes of law as this country has. But the United States has absolutely no problems at all in not trying these sorts of offences in the United States but deporting people to be tried in other jurisdictions where they may not get the fullest possible opportunities for the legal defences that are offered under the United States judicial system. So, the complaints of the honourable member for Menzies about this amendment, which he is going to support anyway, albeit grudgingly, are totally bogus.

As the honourable member for McPherson (Mr White) well knows, all provisions in this Act that deal with anything that could conceivably relate to Australian servicemen protect their position. That is not just the opinion of this Government. Honourable members should read a few columnists who have sat down and seriously studied the legislation that is before the House. Because it wants to avoid a debate inside the ranks of the Liberal Party-particularly inside the ranks of the New South Wales Branch of the Liberal Party-the Opposition has raised these totally bogus concerns. If disloyalty lies anywhere here, it lies with somebody who introduces a totally bogus legal consideration into this matter. There are no Australian servicemen who have been involved in any acts in the Second World War, in Europe or anywhere else, who could conceivably come within the framework of this legislation. The Opposition knows that and so does the Australian public. The disloyalty lies in attempting to cover potential criminals, potential mass murderers and wrap them in the flag of Australian servicemen. That is the immorality in this whole issue.

        —I did not intend to rise in this debate to discuss these points, but I am disgusted by the stand of the shadow Attorney-General, the honourable member for Menzies (Mr N.A. Brown), who has brought up some hocus pocus. He said that Senator Stone had called the War Crimes Amendment Bill a hocus pocus Bill which was badly drafted. The Opposition had 38 years in government to draft a Bill like this. There were allegations and accusations that the Liberal-National Government of Mr Menzies was harbouring war criminals in Australia. Time and again there were allegations in the press, on the radio, by individuals and organisations that that Government let war criminals into this country under the immigration laws; that they were not screened.

        —No, the Menzies Government. Menzies got up and said that there were no war criminals in Australia; that no-one could be accused of war crimes. Senator Greenwood said, `There are no war criminals in Australia; there are no such people.' If there are no such people, what are Opposition members worrying about? Who are they protecting? Liberal governments had 38 years-they were in power for 35 of those 38 years-to deal with this matter. Now Opposition members are saying, `It is too late; it all happened 45 years ago'. Why did they not act? Why did they not do something about it? If the Opposition was not prepared to prevent war criminals from coming here under the immigration laws and taking Australian citizenship, what does it want to do now? Does it want to say that they do not exist? If they do not exist, who is it protecting? Is the Opposition protecting some members of its own Party-the uglies, the beauties or whatever the factions are called in New South Wales? Is that the problem? Is that where the Opposition's loyalties are? I fully support this Bill. I fully support the amendment.

        —We support this amendment. Indeed, it should be placed on the record that this was one of the two major amendments which the Opposition proposed. It is in fact an amendment which will ensure that the court will have a real power to stay proceedings where, because of lapse of time and the very nature of these offences, there is a risk of an injustice taking place.

       This amendment has its origins in the work done by the Opposition and the advice which the Opposition has obtained. It was very unfortunate that with this amendment, as with others, the Government fought it tooth and nail for months. Now it has seen the light and we congratulate it on adopting the amendment, albeit belatedly. Of course, it has dressed it up in its own words to give it an air of originality, but nevertheless in substance it is the amendment which the Opposition proposed.

      <para>
       It is very important that there should be such an amendment. I cannot help but recall a very vivid recent illustration of the problems that arise when people are expected to remember events which happened years ago. The Committee will recall that some weeks ago in the debate on what I shall call the Eddie Kornhauser matter, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) was challenged about a meeting that he had had with some other people some 8 1/2 years ago. He threw up his hands in despair, got that look on his face that he gets sometimes and said, `How can anyone be expected to remember what happened 8 1/2 years ago? How can you expect me to remember that? People cannot remember conversations and what they did 8 1/2 years ago'. What a vivid illustration of the very situation we face here, because the Government is now expecting defendants, under these proceedings, to defend themselves on the basis of their recollection of events that happened 45 years ago. `Where were you on this date? What were you doing on this date? Where were your witnesses? Where are your witnesses now? Produce them. What can you remember? Surely you can remember precisely what you were doing on the afternoon of 3 June 1940.' That is the difficulty.

       In case the honourable member for Hotham (Mr Kent) is going to intervene, let me say that we believe, beyond any shadow of doubt, that people who committed these horrendous crimes, of course should be put on trial. I hope that he would agree also that they should get a fair trial. If they are to get a fair trial, then there must be an opportunity for the court to have regard to the lapse of time, deceased witnesses and lost documents and those sorts of problems. This amendment, which the Government is now proposing, and which originated from the Opposition, will cater for those problems. We, of course, support it.

        —I thank the honourable member for his contribution. I want to make the point that it was always thought to be the case-and I do not think he would disagree-that the courts would apply the normal rules of evidence and be able to look at the question of the delay. That is now virtually a common law position, but we are stating here in order to put it beyond any argument that has arisen, unfortunately, as a result of the inability to get a bipartisan attitude to the process. We do not mind stating that.

       The honourable member for Menzies (Mr N.A. Brown) made another point about the lapse of time and memory. I do not think that time will erase the events at issue in these allegations. Some of the next of kin of people who may be witnesses were exterminated-I do not think they will forget that. The allegations would be so horrendous and so personal that witnesses would not have any problem about the lapse of time. Some have already given evidence in Germany as to the situation. What they do have is a very clear, burnt-in impression in their brain of what happened to their loved ones when they were exterminated-in some cases because of their religion. Very specific evidence has already been given.
      </para>
      <para>
       Whilst the honourable member for Menzies can advert to the fact that perhaps the 40-odd years is far too long, I point out that if he keeps saying that there is no point in our proceeding with the Bill at all. We cannot alter the lapse of time, the 40-odd years has gone but the memory has not and the deaths have not been forgotten. That is the point. If the honourable member looked at some of the evidence given in Germany of what happened in these camps, how women and children were sent to their death for no other reason except, perhaps, that they belonged to the Jewish race, he would realise that those things are not forgotten. If a defendant feels that he is prejudiced by the lapse of time, by being unable to get evidence, certainly that should be given credence. It puts the matter beyond doubt. We are just trying to overcome an unfortunate situation that suggests there is something wrong with having a trial in Australia. There is no alternative to this. Let us hope that we do not have any trials in Australia, but if there is a trial it will be held on the fairest basis in the world. Nobody else has gone to this trouble and it is about time we looked at that issue.

        —I am one of those who are somewhat disappointed at the amount of time the Government took to come round to the view that this amendment ought to be accepted and I was surprised that the Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen) was still raising arguments today that suggested that there were, perhaps, good reasons why this matter ought not to have been pursued and the Government was, in some way, merely accommodating the Opposition. My old master solicitor, who used to speak very highly-and no doubt still does-of the Attorney-General, used to say to me in this matter, `One should exercise more abundant precaution'. I must say that this is one of those areas where it seems to me that that is very appropriate.

      <para>
       The argument was that the very passage of this War Crimes Amendment Bill could be construed as having overcome or removed the operation of the ordinary rules that the courts might apply, particularly in relation to the question of the passage of time. The courts would be asked to construe the legislation on the basis that the Parliament, by passing this very legislation, intended that these matters should be dealt with, even though they may have occurred 45 years ago and the question that the honourable member for Menzies (Mr N. A. Brown) has raised might well have been relevant. Whilst the argument is a technical one and one that courts might or might not have upheld, it seems to me that there is nothing to be lost by the words that the Opposition intended to add, or that the Attorney-General has now added. All the amendment does is make clear the principle that the Attorney-General tells us he wanted to see apply, that we wanted to see apply and in which there was opinion of eminent counsel to suggest that the courts might not be able to apply. If there was any case where more abundant precaution should have applied, it was this case. It might have taken a lot of the agony out of the negotiations in which the Government was involved with the Opposition and avoided a good deal of the agony in which the Opposition was involved in relation to this matter in any event, if this amendment, this very reasonable amendment, could have been accepted at a far earlier point in time.
      </para>
      <para>
       I think it was somewhat churlish, in fact, to put the matter to one side and deal with it at the door of the court, as it were. These are the sorts of bar tactics that are used in negotiations by those people who want to squeeze every last drop out of their opponents. They leave it until the matter is being dealt with at the court. That is what the Attorney has done. He has left it until the Senate had an opportunity to press him, and then he has said, `I will give way on that'. I think they are pretty poor tactics and I think it was very unfortunate that that occurred in relation to this matter, because I certainly, as one who wants to see these things dealt with, wanted to see an element of goodwill on the Government's part in relation to accommodating all of the very reasonable amendments that the Opposition has pressed.

There is also a new section 13B, which provides that where the court has ordered the removal of proceedings to another jurisdiction the court may make other orders necessary to effect that removal, requires that all proceedings be conducted in that jurisdiction and would preclude the accused, if the court so ordered, from making further applications for a change of venue.

       Amendment 12 ensures that the preclusion of any defence of superior orders by section 14 is subject to the operation of any defences available under Australian law, either at the time of the offence or at the time of charge, which is akin to a defence of superior orders. I accept that amendment.

       I accept amendment 13. It inserts a new section 15, which ensures that, in relation to the defence that the conduct was permitted by the laws, customs and usages of war and was not at international law a crime against humanity, the accused bears only an evidential onus and the Crown must rebut that defence beyond reasonable doubt before the accused can be convicted of the offence if that defence is raised. This amendment makes it clear that the exigencies and necessities of war are covered by the laws, customs and usages of war.

       I accept amendment 14. This provision gives the Attorney-General power to grant legal assistance to a person charged with a war crime and provides that if the Attorney-General refuses such an application he must notify the applicant in writing of his decision and the reasons therefor and seek the permission of the applicant for the tabling of the notice in each House of Parliament.

This provision provides additional safeguards to an accused whose extradition is sought for conduct which falls within the ambit of the War Crimes Act. I stress that all the normal requirements applicable to extradition cases apply to the extradition of a person for a war crime.

       The Opposition says that there should be a right of appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. The amendment requiring an annual report to be tabled in the Parliament came from the Opposition and the Government has now accepted that. With respect to extradition, that likewise was an amendment which the Opposition proposed and, of course, which the Government fought tooth and nail. In fact, the letter from the Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen) to me on 27 September, in rejecting this amendment which the Government has now accepted, said, `How can we possibly agree to this, to require that there cannot be any extradition unless a prima facie case has been made out? How can we possibly agree to this when it would be contrary to our extradition treaties?'. What was contrary to an extradition treaty in September is all right in December? Snap one's fingers, the whole world changes and the problems are over. Of course, the reality is that the Government was in a corner and this is the only way it could get out of it. It abandoned principle for the sake of convenience. The Opposition still says, with respect to extradition, that there should be a complete embargo on the extradition of people to be charged with these offences and similar offences if they are to be extradited to Warsaw Pact countries or Yugoslavia. But the Government has not accepted that amendment.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Opposition therefore accepts those amendments. We have saved some time by dealing with them compendiously; but we simply place on record the fact that there are other amendments which the Government has not accepted, which it should have accepted and which would have made the Bill a better one. I repeat that we support the thrust and the objective of this legislation but we do maintain, first, that there should be an exclusion of all Australian ex-service personnel; secondly, that there should be an appeal in the case of applicants for legal aid who have had that legal aid refused; thirdly, that there should be an amendment which has been overlooked and I think forgotten but which is tremendously important in the Opposition's view.
      </para>
      <para>
       That is an amendment to give defendants access to witnesses, sites and documents in Warsaw Pact countries or Yugoslavia and indeed to go so far as to say that there should be no prosecutions where the prosecution will rely on evidence from those countries, unless the defendant is given a fair chance of having access to those witnesses, sites and documents in those countries. That will do no more than help the defendant to get a fair trial. Surely there are two principles in this matter: one is that those who committed these horrendous offences should be put on trial and the second, also important, is that they should get a fair trial. To get a fair trial for those who will be prosecuted where the prosecution will rely upon evidence from Warsaw Pact countries or Yugoslavia, the prosecution should not take place unless the defendants are given access to that material. Fourthly, as I have already said, we still believe that there should be an amendment to prevent extradition to a Warsaw Pact country or to Yugoslavia.

        —I thank the honourable member for Menzies (Mr N.A. Brown) for his contribution. He would know that we do not agree to extradition to countries with which we do not have a treaty. The issue of a prima facie case, of course, arose in respect of the treaty. The question of prima facie seems to have two definitions. Pursuant to the treaty, what is called the modern definition of prima facie is some evidence or allegation that an offence has been committed. We will accept the view that in these cases we would need to have more than that. We would need to have the prima facie evidence that would guarantee virtually a committal.

       The point that I have been trying to make from the commencement of this debate, which goes back to February of 1987, is that for the first time in the world Australia has developed a concept whereby it can deal with residents who were not residents at the time of the cessation of the Second World War in accordance with normal court procedures. This of course does lead to the issue that the United States does not. It talks about extradition. Menzies talked about extradition being an opportunity or revocation of citizenship being the way out, but we do not accept that as being a very satisfactory result. I think that is where some credit has to be given for what we are about here. He makes the point that we can run into all sorts of difficulties here. He says this:
      </para>
      <para>
       If it was not thought appropriate . . . this is a matter for judgement . . . consideration should be given to proceeding by way of revocation of citizenship and deportation in the case of citizens who acquired citizenship less than ten years ago and deportation in the case of non-citizens. If this is not practical or appropriate . . . the Government should consider . . . permitting a civil court to deal with a war crime.
      </para>
      <para>
       We have done that. Whereas this debate started off virtually on a bipartisan basis, that we had a problem in this country or we appeared to have a problem in this country, we seem to have deteriorated into the belief that there is something wrong with this legislation.

        —We will wait and see; but I just make the point that I do not think any government is taking this as being an issue that belongs to government policy. It relates to the fact that something has to be done about dealing with allegations that there are war criminals somewhere in Australia. They certainly do not exist in the Australian armed services or in the former armed services, which is the unfortunate result of the Opposition's belated amendment. It was not moved at the time of the second reading debate; it was moved subsequently.

We have the Director of Public Prosecutions, who is to look at it from an impartial point of view. That is the whole idea of the Director of Public Prosecutions. That is the law here and that is the point. Certainly from the point of view of miscarriage of justice the matters can be raised, but here we are talking about allegations. I just think this has taken an extraordinarily long while. We got a Bill passed in this House as far back as October 1987. We are now in the dying days of 1988 desperately trying to get it passed. There is another intelligence in this. The Opposition never really wanted the Bill. The point is that if the Opposition really wanted to assist in dealing with this matter, it could have been dealt with in the first session of 1988. The Opposition is not really sincere about this. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) would know that some of the interjections are not altogether far removed from the point as to the reasons why the Liberal Party did not want to deal with this issue.

       <para>
        The Senate returns to the House of Representatives the Bill for an Act relating to the grant of financial assistance to the States and the Northern Territory for schools and for related matters, and acquaints the House of Representatives that the Senate has considered message No. 359 of the House dated 21 December 1988, in reference to such Bill.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Senate has resolved to press its requests for the amendments and again requests the House of Representatives to make such amendments, as indicated by Schedule A annexed.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Senate desires to inform the House that the amendments indicated by Schedule B annexed have been made by the Senate in the Bill.
       </para>
       <para>
        Before the House resolves itself into the Committee of the Whole, I wish to read to the House a statement, on behalf of Madam Speaker, on the subject of the message I have just announced. Where the personal pronoun `I' occurs, it refers to Madam Speaker.
       </para>
       <para>
        I draw the attention of the House to the constitutional question which this message involves. The message purports to repeat the requests for amendments contained in message No. 274 which the House rejected at its sitting earlier today. The `right' of the Senate to repeat and thereby press or insist on a request for an amendment has never been accepted by the House of Representatives.
       </para>
       <para>
        On several previous occasions when a request was pressed on the House by repetition the House had regard to the claim that the public welfare required passage of the legislation which was the subject of the pressed request and gave the pressed request the House's consideration notwithstanding that the House resolved to refrain from determining its constitutional rights. The House so informed the Senate of the terms of its resolution in its message to the Senate in reply.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is not certain whether the Senate's `right' to press a request by repetition is justiciable in the courts. However, it is a matter of constitutional propriety as between the Houses based on the provisions of sections 53 to 57 of the Constitution. Strong arguments that the Constitution does not give the Senate the rights to press a request were advanced by Quick and Garran who were intimately involved in the development of the Constitution. Their views may be found on pages 671 and 672 of their treatise on the Constitution.
       </para>
       <para>
        In 1943, some 40 years later, the question was examined by four eminent constitutional lawyers-Garran, Knowles, Bailey and Castieau-who, after considering other learned opinion, summed up the question in the following words:

        We think it clear that the Constitution did not intend to stultify itself by giving back in one clause what it had taken away in another. The essence of the difference between request and amendment is that in the case of a request the right of decision as to the form of the Bill rests solely with the House of Representatives. To press a request is to insist upon it-which is a contradiction in terms, and also in our opinion unconstitutional.

        Madam Speaker continues: I respectfully agree with these opinions, as I had reason to indicate to the House as recently as 11 April 1986.

       <para>
        Honourable members will recall that when this matter was before the chamber earlier today we had requests from the Senate which were quite clearly defective in a technical and major sense because they purported to extend benefits which the Government intended to withdraw in relation to establishment grants for new non-government schools. The Senate, in considering the rejection of that request later in the day, decided to foreshadow a further amendment which would correct those technical deficiencies. The way in which the Senate has chosen to correct those technical deficiencies would add a new subclause after subclause 22 (2) which would give the Minister the discretion to make certain payments to these schools, and I read precisely:
       </para>
       <para>
        Where a school has been provisionally approved to commence in the year beginning January 1, 1989, the Minister may-
       </para>
       <para>
        and I emphasise the word `may'-
       </para>
       <para>
        by determination in writing, authorise the payment to the State under this section by way of financial assistance to the State for recurrent expenditure of the school . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        The important thing here is that this does not require the Government to make any particular expenditure. It does give the Minister a discretion to make a payment. It is worth making the point that the only reason the Government is agreeing to this request is that it does not make it mandatory-a point which was made in the Senate by my colleague the Minister for Finance-for the Government to make these payments which it announced in the May statement it would not be doing. For those on the other side who have said that the white flag has been run up the mast, I can assure them that that is not the case.

         —The Leader of the Opposition, in between his cackles, asks why we voted against it before. The reason we voted against it before was that his ninny friends in the upper House had got it wrong. Indeed, if we had been particularly smart we would have agreed to it at that time because it was so technically deficient that it was inoperative in any event. We decided that the best course to take was to point out to the Senate that its request was technically deficient. It has now taken the action of foreshadowing a further amendment which will be moved in the Senate and which will correct the technical deficiency; but, in correcting the technical deficiency, the Senate makes the payment of these establishment grants entirely discretionary in the hands of the Minister.

       <para>
        Whilst this is a nice bit of face-saving for the Senate, it does not require us to reinstate the payments which the Government decided in May that it would withdraw in the context of its historically important overall package of support for non-government schools. We will have in this Bill when it returns to the Senate a provision which will leave in the Minister a discretion to pay to certain schools establishment grants for those schools starting in 1989, but I can say that the Budget has not been recast and therefore the additional funds necessary have not been identified at this point. We can say that, unless there was an identification of offsetting savings from the same area within this Bill, there would be no payments made using the ministerial discretion which the Senate intends to place within this particular measure. It is for the reason that this matter is a matter of discretion-it is not a measure which mandates any particular additional expenditure over and above that which was decided by the Government in the Budget context-and only that reason that we will be agreeing to this particular proposal.
       </para>
       <para>
        There has been some speculation about what we might do in relation to the pressed amendment in relation to the technical and further education (TAFE) Bill. I can assure honourable members that it will be the Government's intention to send that back to the Senate without agreement. We will have in that case-a matter entirely in the hands of the Senate-the fact that payments which ought to be made to the technical and further education system throughout Australia will be at least delayed as a result of this unconstitutional action on the part of the Senate. In relation to this matter, where there is $1.9 billion at stake which should properly be paid to the States and the non-government school system, we will not hold that up on this measure because the way in which the Senate has now cast its proposal does not mandate any additional expenditure on our part in relation to these establishment grants which the Government decided in May and in the Budget that it would withdraw, phase out.
       </para>
       <para>
        This is a serious matter. The Opposition guffawed about the statement which was read out by the Deputy Speaker on behalf of the Speaker. These are crucially important issues. We will not have a situation where irresponsible senators will mess around with our Budgets. We are the ones who have the responsibility for putting together responsible Budgets. We are the ones who have the only constitutional power to initiate expenditure. That is why a statement is needed from the Governor-General in order to initiate those appropriations. This is the House in which appropriations will be initiated; this is the House in which Budgets will be cast; and this is the House in which any changes to Budgets will be contemplated. The Senate will have to contemplate over the summer what damage it is doing to the TAFE system as a result of its recalcitrance in relation to the matter which will come before us later this evening. In relation to this matter, we have decided, as the motion agreed to by the House a moment ago said, that there is an important public interest here in respect of the payment of $1.9 billion.

         —The honourable member for Mitchell may well interject. What he has to answer for is how the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Peacock) and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) can swan around this country berating the Government for overexpenditure, imploring the Government to reduce expenditure, and then come in here and vote irresponsibly to increase expenditure in areas where the Government has already determined that expenditure ought to be reduced. That is the area not only of irresponsibility but also of fiscal inconsistency. The question that has to be answered by the Opposition is how on earth it can on the one hand advocate expenditure reductions and yet come in here and vote for measures which were not dreamt up on this side of the House but, rather, were initiated in the Senate.

        The honourable member for Deakin (Mr Beale) had no idea what amendments might be contemplated when this measure was first before the House. All he said was that in the Senate there would be a contemplation of amendments which would criticise the Government for certain measures the Government intended to put into effect in these Bills. There was no anticipation of amendments which would meddle with the appropriations; no anticipation of amendments which would increase appropriations or reverse properly construed Budget decisions which this Government had made. Now we have some inconsequential senator from South Australia who decided to dream up these proposals and has finally got it right, having been told by this House earlier today that the Opposition's early attempt was technically totally incompetent, but has got it right in a way which does not mandate any additional expenditure overall. For that reason the Government will not hold up the funds which should properly be flowing to the vast number of non-government schools that rely so heavily on funds from this Government; will not hold up the funds that go to State governments to support the State government school system; and will not hold up the funds which go to capital projects in both the government and non-government school systems. But anyone who is waiting and holding his breath for us to respond to this invitation to increase our appropriations overall will be waiting a very long time.

         —Mr Chairman, what an extraordinary display we have seen from the Government today. What an extraordinary display of incompetence and arrogance we have seen from the Government. The first thing is that we did not need to come back today because we foreshadowed in this House what we were going to do in the Senate. The Opposition had to do it in that way because the Government applied the guillotine here and the only chance for the Opposition to make the amendments was in the Senate. If the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) had only listened in this chamber to what the Opposition was saying, Government members would not have had to be here today. If they are complaining about being here they can blame the Minister. His failure to heed what the Opposition had to say in this chamber, his failure to understand what the Opposition was going to do in the Senate, meant that Government members had to be brought back here today. That was the first step in this extraordinary display of incompetence that we have seen today.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The second step was the extraordinary number of conferences we had, with people running up and down this marvellous front bench of the Government's: `The bits of paper are not here', `We cannot do anything', `We will bring it on', `We will take it off again', `We can't, there are no bits of paper'. These blokes opposite could not run a chook house. Their performance today, their incompetence, their arrogance, has been so bad that they must be doubly blessed because that broadcasting sign is not on. If the people of Australia had listened today or watched Government members scurrying up and down here like chooks with their heads cut off, there is no doubt that this myth-that is what it is, an absolute myth-that the Government has a competent front bench would evaporate instantaneously.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government has displayed an extraordinary amount of incompetence today; and now, guess what? The white flag is up. For all the grandstanding, for all the huffing and puffing, for all the talk the Government went on with, it has now given way. The Minister has wasted all the money. We will come to the next Bill, and the Government has a pretty clear message what the Senate is going to do. The Senate is pretty well disposed to send back to this chamber again and again what was agreed there until the Government runs up the white flag again. That is what the Senate is going to do. That is what we will be talking about in the other Bill when it comes before the chamber later tonight.
       </para>
       <para>
        There has been an extraordinary display of arrogance, of incompetence, of Ministers not knowing what is going on, of their advisers running backwards and forwards, of drafting amendments and redrafting amendments. This extraordinary display of incompetence sets at rest once and for all this extraordinary myth that the Government has a competent front bench. The Government is tired, it is arrogant, it is out of touch, it is incompetent, and it is time to go. I am reminded that the average Australian over the period of this Government is $56 a week worse off. Tired, arrogant, incompetent-and people are $56 a week worse off. It is all very well for the Government to be carrying on like this. I can tell the Government that if it is behaving like this now, it is going to be a lot worse when the States Grants (Technical and Further Education Assistance) Bill comes back into the House with the same message to this Minister. Guess what the Minister is going to be doing during dinner? He is going to be running around trying to find another peg. He found a funny little peg for the States Grants (Schools Assistance) Bill; he is going to find a peg for the TAFE Bill. Mark my words: the Senate has already sent on its way back here the TAFE Bill, which is going to deliver the same message as the schools Bill did. Your Minister is going to be running around at dinnertime trying to find a way out of the dilemma he has got himself into. Again I say to you rabble over there--

It is infinitely preferable to be talking to the Chair than it is to be talking to that absolutely incompetent rabble over there. Mr Deputy Chairman, it is worth while reminding the Committee what all this establishment grants kerfuffle has been about. By the way, Government members should not go away. The Opposition has two or three other amendments that the Minister will also have to run up the white flag on in a couple of minutes. I want to draw attention to a letter from the Minister's Department dated 16 December 1987, before the 1988 May statement, headed `Proposed Commencement of a New School in 1989'. It states:

        That the Committee insists on disagreeing to the amendments insisted on by the Senate.
       </para>
       <para>
        I think we have traversed this territory once already today; so it is probably not necessary for us to go into very great detail again, except to remind the Committee that the amendments Nos 2 and 3 that we are dealing with-that is, the original amendments Nos 2 and 3 which the Committee had not agreed to and which the Senate is now insisting upon-were disagreed to by the Committee for a couple of reasons. The first was that they came to the Chamber from the Senate as amendments to the original Bill, amendments which the Chamber believes contravene-and on the basis of advice from the Parliamentary Counsel and other distinguished legal advisers contravene-section 53 of the Constitution in the sense that it is not for the Senate to impose a greater financial burden on the people. That is what this amendment purports to do.
       </para>
       <para>
        It would have been better, if possible, for the Senate to recast this proposal as a request, as it did on the earlier occasion in respect of the Sates Grants (Schools Assistance) Bill. But, as it happens, one of the major reasons for the House objecting to the Senate's amendment was simply that on the advice we had it contravened the Constitution in the terms that I have expressed. There was another reason as well, but even if it had been cast in the form of a request the House would still have rejected it because it seeks to reverse a decision taken by the Government in relation to the funding of non-government business colleges. For many years, indeed going back to the time when tertiary fees were first abolished, in 1973 for the 1974 academic year, it was the position of the then Government in 1974, and of subsequent governments, to provide some fee relief for those students who were attending non-government business colleges.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government, in reviewing its higher education policy and its tertiary education policy generally, has decided that it will not support non-government tertiary institutions of this kind. We also had a situation where there had been no new entrants, no new colleges approved, in the context of this scheme and no new courses approved in the context of this scheme for some years. So we had a situation where students attending some non-government business colleges were receiving the subsidy support, others in other colleges were not, and even within the same college some students attending one course were receiving support whereas those attending another course were not.
       </para>
       <para>
        There was this major inconsistency which had to be resolved in either one of two ways-either we had to extend the support, at a very substantial cost, to a larger number of business colleges and a larger number of courses, or else we had to decide to phase out this support for non-government business colleges. The Government took the decision, in the context of the May statement and the context of the financial support we provide to the States for technical and further education (TAFE) and in the context of the substantial expansion for higher education, that looking at the education budget in total it was not appropriate for us to extend support for non-government business colleges and therefore we took the only other decision available to us, which was to phase it out.
       </para>
       <para>
        I make the observation that, since we relaxed the rules which prevented the coming to Australia of students to undertake full free courses, the non-government business colleges, have been major beneficiaries of that policy. Perhaps `beneficiary' is the wrong word, but they have been the ones who have been most enthusiastic about taking up those new opportunities. Literally thousands of overseas students are now enrolled, paying full fees, in these non-government business colleges. Many of them have expanded their operations substantially and, indeed, many new colleges have started up. So it would not be right to say that these colleges were in a state of financial collapse, and indeed I can say from discussions that I have had with representatives of these colleges that, even if they are not throwing their hats in the air, they at least understand the reasons behind the Government's decision.
       </para>
       <para>
        There was a particular problem for those students who had been accepted for courses in 1989 prior to the Government's decision having been announced and it was with those students in mind that we decided to increase support. At Budget time we agreed to extend support later in the year, to the tune of an additional $1.5m which was to be provided to support those students who had enrolled for courses in 1989 prior to the announcement earlier this year. The Government is not inclined to go beyond that point. We are not inclined to reverse the decision that we took in the context of a difficult budgetary situation, and I might say pursuing a fiscal policy which the Opposition would claim is not tight enough. In other words it would claim that we should be spending less money, not more. But in the context of trying to get fiscal policy right-and we have been far more successful than any other government that has gone before us in that sense-we had to make some difficult decisions and this was one of them. This will provide for savings to the tune of $5m per calendar year, and a reversal of this decision as proposed by the Senate will, of course, increase appropriations by a like amount if that were to be the way in which the matter was handled.
       </para>

        There are two other issues that need to be considered. Firstly, it would be possible to save the money elsewhere in the States Grants (Technical and Further Education Assistance) Bill, but that would mean taking money away from the States for support of the TAFE system, and that is a decision which the Government is disinclined to take at least at this time. Secondly, there is the related question of eligibility for Austudy. The way in which Austudy operates at the moment, eligibility is determined by those students who are enrolled in government supported courses and therefore those who have been enrolled in courses in these business colleges which receive a subsidy have been eligible to receive Austudy. Those who are in courses not supported or in colleges not supported are not eligible for Austudy.
       </para>
       <para>
        This proposal from the Senate to continue this policy of subsidising non-government business colleges does not only involve the expenditure of the subsidy to the colleges but also involves a continuation of the eligibility for Austudy for those particular students. This is a big issue because it is not just the $5m, which is the cost of the existing program that we are talking about but, in order to maintain any semblance of consistency, if we were going to maintain it for some colleges and some courses we would have to extend it to other colleges and other courses at a far greater cost than the $5m that we are talking about here.
       </para>
       <para>
        But this $5m is not a trivial issue. We are concerned not to have the Senate trying to make a patchwork quilt out of our Budget-that is, accepting some parts of it but trying to add to expenditure in other parts of it. It is not the role of the Senate to put together Commonwealth Budgets. It is the role of the properly elected government, and that is what we have done and that is what we continue to do. It is for that reason that we are not going to accept the Senate's insistence on this particular measure and, lest there be any suggestion there is an inconsistent approach between this matter and the one we dealt with before the adjournment, I want to make the point that there is a quite clear constitutional issue here which needs to be resolved; that is, the Senate is pressing its case that this is not an issue over which a request was the appropriate way to approach the House of Representatives but rather that an amendment was the appropriate device. There are quite clear conflicting opinions about that. There are the opinions that we have which quite clearly say that it is not the prerogative of the Senate to approach the House on this measure in that way. Presumably the majority in the Senate has different advice, and during the period between now and when the Parliament next resumes-because I do not expect that this matter will be resolved tonight-there will be the opportunity to further pursue that matter.
       </para>
       <para>
        There will also be an opportunity for us to consider whether or not we should take funds from somewhere else in this Bill, in other words from the TAFE system, in order to pay the cost of extending this measure in the way in which the Senate would propose because we are not increasing, and no-one would expect us to, appropriations contrary to a decision that we have made in the Budget context.
       </para>
       <para>
        Over the course of the summer I hope that the Opposition and the Senate will contemplate the potential damage that they have done to the TAFE system as a result of delaying payments because there will inevitably be some delay in the payments that we can make to the States both for the recurrent and the capital costs of running TAFE colleges throughout Australia. There will also be an incapacity for us to pay anything to the non-government business colleges either in respect of that phase-out period that we were talking about or in respect of the additional $1.5m which this Bill attempted to appropriate. So what is going to happen is that the TAFE system will at least have its funds delayed and the non-government business college system will at least have its funds delayed until this matter can be further considered either by the Senate or perhaps by both Houses when the Parliament resumes later in February or early in March. It is for those reasons that I support the motion.

         —Mr Deputy Chairman, I just want to make the point that the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) said he thought we had traversed this ground earlier today and that he did not want to take too much time, but he has taken 15 minutes which is much more time than he took this morning. When these Bills were debated cognately a few weeks ago we foreshadowed in this chamber that the Senate would make the amendments that it has made and so I just say again to the Minister that he was very well aware of what we had proposed with the non-government business colleges and that he should have taken that into account before subjecting us all to this recall of the Parliament.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The Minister has made much of the so-called constitutional aspects of the States Grants (Technical and Further Education Assistance) Bill and in his speech this morning he said that all the legal advice that the Government had received suggested that what the Senate chose to do was unconstitutional. This afternoon, presumably after having had advice on the speeches in the Senate, he changed his tack and said that it was clear that the Opposition and the Australian Democrats in the Senate had had different legal advice. If one asks a bunch of lawyers for their opinion on this sort of subject, one gets a range of views. What we are asking for here-and I think I made this clear this afternoon-is for the status quo to be maintained and the Senate amendments give effect to that wish of ours.
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr Deputy Chairman, there is no need for me to reiterate at length why we do not like what the Government has done to non-government business colleges; we do not like the fact that this is just another group in the private sector that the Government is belting; and we do not like the fact that in its grand plan for education in Australia it wants to get rid of all the small institutions because small institutions are much more difficult to manage and deal with. The Government is trying to get together big blocks of educational institutions. This makes it much easier for it to impose its will on the peak bodies and to achieve its corporate state objectives in education. We see that with the amalgamation of the higher education institutions; we see it with the Government's wish for educational profiles in schools, universities and colleges of advanced education.
       </para>
       <para>
        I again draw the attention of the Committee to the brawl that has erupted between the Minister for Employment, Education and Training and the Minister for Education in New South Wales-a brawl, incidentally, that had previously erupted between this Minister and the Labor Minister for Education in New South Wales-where New South Wales is saying, `We don't want you interfering in our education process here; we don't want you telling us what to teach our children; we don't want you interfering; and we don't want central control in Canberra. So we do not like what the Government is doing'. This manifests itself, in what the Government is seeking to do with non-government business colleges.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Minister also said that his discussions with representatives of those colleges had been very amicable. But, if one has had $6m taken away and the Minister says, `Because of the mass of representations that I have had'-and I say to the Minister that I have also had a mass of representations-`come back and talk to us, we might be able to find a way to give you $1 1/2m this year before phasing it out', of course there will be an amicable conversation. But that is a loaded gun at the head situation. I suppose the Minister really does understand what he is doing because he has done it with the higher education institutions as well.
       </para>
       <para>
        I would just like to make a comment on fiscal policy because the Minister made reference to that this morning. It is absurd to suggest that in the development of our fiscal policy we will agree with the Government on every item except those items where we would cut spending. There will be some items in respect of which we will want to cut expenditure-a majority of the items-but there will also be some items that happen to fit our political philosophy where we may choose to make more funds available. So all this running off at the mouth and saying, `Look, you are financially irresponsible because you want to spend a little more money in this area', is completely inconsistent with the global approach that we will take to the control of government spending and the development of fiscal policy.
       </para>
       <para>
        I just want to touch briefly on this question of political blackmail to which the Minister has referred. The Minister is now, presumably, going to be running around the technical and further education colleges (TAFE) and saying, `Look, we would have loved to have given you a new gym, but that wicked Senate won't allow any money through the system. So we can't give you any money for your gym because of the Senate'. Well that is absurd. It is open to the Minister at any time to agree to the Senate's proposal and let the Bill go through. We will be going around to these TAFE colleges and saying, `If the Minister is saying that to you, it is because of the Government's cussed-mindedness and its inability to deal sensibly with a proposal that has the majority of support in the House of review'. We will be going around and saying--

        So we will be delivering our message to the TAFE colleges around Australia that it is open to this Government at any time to allow this legislation through. It has not been passed because of the Government's cussed-mindedness. We will be saying to the TAFE colleges that again, with this legislation today, we have seen how arrogant, how out of touch and how incompetent the Government is. This much vaunted front bench looked like an absolute rabble today. We will also be saying that the average Australian family is $56 a week worse off under Labor over the last six years.

       <para>
        For good measure, we will also be saying what a fantastic document our Future Directions is and what a successful launch the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard), his deputy, the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock), and the rest of us have made of that document which has transformed the political landscape around Australia and had Government supporters running off to their burrows with their tails between their legs. There was a shrill response by the Prime Minister on day one, and then nothing. Where is the Government's response to the framework that the coalition parties have established for the kind of Australia they want, the kind of Australia that gives incentive, choice and competition-the very things that we want in education that are quite different from the things that this Minister wants with his corporate state in education?

        Madam Speaker, this motion which was first put forward by the Opposition some hours ago is not only about ministerial standards, the competence of the front bench of the Hawke Government and the standards demanded by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) of his Ministers but, more important than that, it goes to the very heart of the attitude of the Hawke Government towards the institution of parliament. It is therefore appropriate that this censure motion be moved today, a day which has witnessed a shambolic handling of this Parliament by the Government; a day which has demonstrated again the depth of contempt that the Hawke Government has for the institution of parliament; and a day which explains very clearly the mentality of a Treasurer who says that Question Time is not a privilege of the elected people of the nation but a courtesy extended by the Executive to the Parliament.
       </para>
       <para>
        The attitude of every member of the Government towards the recall of the House of Representatives today was not the attitude of people accepting an exercise in democracy, or of people who accepted that the other chamber in our bicameral system had a certain quantum of rights, but rather it was the attitude of a group of people who found democracy profoundly irksome. In the quite disgraceful words of the spokesman for the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) it was going to be a question of gag, gag and gag. At least in some respects the Government has had second thoughts about that. This motion goes to the very heart of whether this Government regards the basic principles of the Westminster system and ministerial responsibility and the basic standards of candour, honesty and competence required of Ministers in our system as being of any account.
       </para>
       <para>
        Tonight we want to examine this matter. We ought to ask the Prime Minister whether he demands the same standards of his Ministers as Gough Whitlam demanded of his Ministers when he was Prime Minister of this country. Many people would think it was passing strange that the standards of the Hawke Government could be found to be below the standards of the Whitlam Government on matters of parliamentary propriety. The reality is that except on one occasion-and ironically enough it was almost a year ago today that the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr John Brown) was pushed and dumped by the Prime Minister-the ministerial standards of this Government have fallen lamentably short of the ministerial standards of the Whitlam Government. It ought to be remembered by this House, and by the Prime Minister, that Gough Whitlam, his Labor predecessor, demanded a far higher standard of the late Rex Connor and of Jim Cairns than he has had the guts to demand of all but one of his Ministers in a period of six years.
       </para>
       <para>
        What is at stake tonight is whether, in the face of the clearest evidence of this Parliament having been misled, in the face of the clearest evidence of ministerial incompetence, and in the face of the clearest evidence negativing the absurd proposition that this is a competent front bench, this Prime Minister is prepared to assert the historical standards demanded of Ministers in this chamber and not least enforced by his own Labor predecessor, Gough Whitlam. This Parliament ought to be reminded that Connor was sacked because he told the Parliament that communications of substance with Khemlani had ceased; a telex was unearthed months later, and he was sacked on that ground. Cairns was sacked despite the fact that he denied any recollection of having signed a letter. Those were the standards that Whitlam was prepared to enforce-a man whom the present Prime Minister has derided and sneered at in the Labor tradition over many years. Tonight we want to know whether the principles of ministerial propriety and prime ministerial courage of this Prime Minister in relation to a group of people he so phonily lauds as the greatest front bench since World War II, come within a proverbial bull's roar of the standards laid down by Gough Whitlam, let alone the standards laid down by Malcolm Fraser and Sir Robert Menzies when they held the office of Prime Minister of this country.
       </para>
       <para>
        We have in front of us clear and unmistakable evidence, relating to two specific items, that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand) has misled the Parliament. He has not only misled the House of Representatives, he has achieved a double header, he has also misled the Senate. The first example of his misleading related to the statement that he made on 8 November when he was asked-and we all remember it-about the funding of the National Aboriginal and Islander Health Organisation (NAIHO) and he gave the answer:
       </para>
       <para>
        I have yet to make a decision.
       </para>
       <para>
        After Question Time the Minister met with senior officers. He went to such lengths that he met ministerial staff in departmental offices, then rang Mr McDonald of his own Department and asked him to agree that the answer he gave in the House was correct. According to Mr McDonald, he agreed in broad terms that the answer was correct but significantly, and of his own volition, and a day after the discussion had taken place, he addressed a memorandum to the Secretary of his Department in which he said this:
       </para>
       <para>
        I do not agree that I accepted that the Minister had not approved funding to the organisation. I have never had any doubt that he had agreed to fund it.
       </para>
       <para>
        I repeat those words: `I have never had any doubt that he had agreed to fund it'. Here we have the man who is supposed to have got the Minister off the hook-McDonald; his own man-who said originally that he took a decision on 31 August to fund NAIHO to the tune of $180,000 and who was subsequently dragooned, heavied and traduced into trying to reconstruct events to save the Minister's neck. That was too much for an honest public servant. He addressed the memorandum to the Secretary of his Department and he laid it fairly and squarely on the line. He nailed the Minister for the dishonesty that he represented to the Parliament and he said, `I have never had any doubt that he had agreed to fund it'. That is the first example of the Minister having misled the Parliament.

         —It is very clear, as my colleague the honourable member for Menzies says. An even better illustration relates to the misleading of the Senate. Here we have an even more culpable example of the Minister having misled the Parliament because he was not caught on the hop and he could not have been mistaken. Yet we are dealing here with a statement that was read to the Senate and it had presumably been settled by the Minister. He gave it to the Senate in circumstances where he knew that his credibility, honesty, candour and competence as a Minister were under assault and being challenged. The statement related to the report of Arthur Anderson and Co.-the report about the money wasted by NAIHO, the report that followed the action of the previous Minister in suspending funding, the report that said that NAIHO had not lived up to the expectations of the Government or of the Aboriginal community. So the Minister was not doing it blind, he was not caught on the run and his mind, presumably, was fully focused on the matter. Yet despite that in the statement given by the Minister for Consumer Affairs (Senator Bolkus) to the Senate this is what he had to say, inter alia:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        This report was compiled before I was Minister and this was the first time it was drawn to my attention.
       </para>
       <para>
        Anybody reading that would take that to mean, `Look, I knew nothing about the Arthur Anderson report until 8 September'. There is no other way that one could interpret that statement. The Minister can shake his head and the Prime Minister, in his presumably fevered defence, will wave his arms around and say, `He's a good bloke, he has my support, he wears his heart on his sleeve and he is interested in the welfare of the Aboriginal people', but when it comes to telling the truth to the Parliament, when he is under notice that he has misled the Parliament, when he is not on the run and not caught on the hook, what the Minister said can only have one plain and unmistakable meaning and that plain and unmistakable meaning is that until that particular date he had never seen that report.
       </para>
       <para>
        The truth, of course, as the Minister well knows, as the Prime Minister knows, as the Senate knows, as every officer in the Minister's Department knows-and is it any wonder that morale is at rock bottom in that Department; is it any wonder that honest members of that Department want the truth to come out?-and as the Aboriginal community knows, is that as far away as July and August of 1987, in a briefing paper given to the Minister, he was told the following things: NAIHO has now received more than $1m of public money but has not lived up to the expectations of either Aboriginal people or the Government. Despite repeated requests, it has failed to account adequately for its funds or to provide considered and timely advice on issues of importance in the Government's efforts to improve Aboriginal health. In May 1986 the Minister instructed that the accounts and administrative practices be audited in depth. The independent professional auditor Arthur Anderson and Co. found that its system of internal control over operations and finances was inadequate, as were the information and advice provided to the Minister, the Department and other Government organisations. The report recommended a number of procedures and measures to redress these deficiencies. A copy of the report was provided on 25 July 1986.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is a succinct and, I put it to the House, fair summary of the Arthur Anderson report. What the Minister, having had that document drawn to his attention as it should have been, is inviting us to believe is that, when he tells the Senate a bare two weeks ago, `This report was compiled before I was Minister and this was the first time it was drawn to my attention', he is not misleading the Parliament. There cannot be a starker example of somebody having been caught in the act of misleading the Parliament.
       </para>
       <para>
        Even if some fevered defence of the Minister will get him out of the first charge, it does not get him out of the second charge. I am quite sure that if Rex Connor were around today he would like to have the benefit of the doubt of a Prime Minister that would let him off in the face of that clear misleading; Cairns would take the same attitude in relation to what Whitlam did; and I am quite sure that the honourable member for Parramatta would think that he is doing it pretty hard, given what happened in relation to him. But no, there has to be something special and something particular in relation to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs.
       </para>
       <para>
        Madam Speaker, this is not just a question of comparing the treatment of different people; it is something that goes to the very heart of the believability of Ministers in this chamber. I am not asking this Parliament and this House to accept an outdated notion of ministerial responsibility. I am not saying that, because some remote out-of-the-way official, far away in a removed area of Australia, makes a wrong decision, the Minister has to lose his head. That was the doctrine that the Government when it was in opposition tried to argue. I am not arguing that. That is unfair and it is out of touch with the reality of modern day government, as the Prime Minister acknowledged in his Sir Robert Garran Memorial Oration on 27 October 1988.
       </para>
       <para>
        What I am doing is asking the Parliament to accept that there are some basic canons of ministerial conduct and there are some things a Minister can do and there are some things he cannot do. If he crosses the line, he ought to go, and if he does not go his Prime Minister ought to have the guts and the strength to sack him. That is what I am saying ought to happen on this occasion. It is as narrow but as important as that. The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs has crossed the line; he has crossed it twice.
       </para>
       <para>
        I put aside for a moment-my colleague the shadow Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, the honourable member for Braddon (Mr Miles), will deal with this in more detail-the incompetence in the administration of the Department and the disappointment in expectations. I am going to the question of whether the Minister was candid and honest with the Parliament. I put it to the Minister, I put it to this Parliament and I put it to the Prime Minister-he is the ultimate custodian of the standards of this Government-that the Minister was not candid with the Parliament. He was at best culpably sloppy and incompetent in the answers that he gave to the Parliament, and at worst he was completely indifferent and cavalier regarding the truthfulness of what he told the Parliament. If that is the nature of his behaviour, then he ought to be removed; he is no longer fit to hold the office of Minister of State in this Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        If the Prime Minister had the standards of his predecessor Whitlam, let alone the standards of his Liberal predecessors Fraser and Menzies, he would have removed the Minister long before now. I say that to the Prime Minister, even if he does not accept a more conventional and orthodox view of ministerial responsibility, even if he adopts-as he apparently does-a more narrow version of ministerial responsibility which he spelt out in his Sir Robert Garran Oration on 27 October last when he had this to say:
       </para>
       <para>
        In other words, Ministers must, of course, continue to be answerable to the Parliament and to take any necessary corrective action.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is the first thing the Prime Minister said. He continued:
       </para>
       <para>
        But the truth is that there is no requirement for them to resign except where a significant act or omission was theirs, or taken at their personal direction, or was a matter about which they obviously should have known, and done something.
       </para>
       <para>
        I put it to the House that even if we accept-and I do not-for the purposes of this debate that narrow definition of ministerial responsibility laid down by the Prime Minister as recently as 27 October 1988, the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs is caught in it. Even on this Clayton's standard of ministerial responsibility the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs has failed the test, because he has not been properly accountable to Parliament; he knew about the Arthur Anderson report; he knew about the suspect findings regarding NAIHO; he knew that a million dollars had been wasted; he knew that Aboriginal expectations and Government expectations had been disappointed; and he knew that he had not been truthful to the Parliament in relation to the $180,000. But, despite all of that and in the clear knowledge that his candour was at stake, he, in cold blood, settled a document which told the Senate that he had never heard of the Arthur Anderson report until 8 September.
       </para>
       <para>
        Here in clear words is the fact that he was told about it when he became the Minister and he was reminded about it on two other occasions. Yet he expects us to believe that he is treating this Parliament with other than complete contempt. I think the Minister's behaviour deserves censure. The Prime Minister ought to remove him. The Parliament will be gratefully indebted to him if he does so.

        </para>

       <para>
        Indeed, as the Leader of the Opposition talks about previous leaders, let me remind him of this: as he says that there are standards to be set and standards to be followed on the question of ministerial responsibility, what was the standard set by the Leader of the Opposition's Government, by his predecessors, when it established its own royal commission to investigate the meat scandal? The then Government established the Woodward Royal Commission into the Australian Meat Industry, and never has there been a more devastating indictment of a Minister than was brought down by the Woodward Royal Commission. The members of that Government would not accept it. Under any normal standard and practice, the Minister concerned should have been dismissed. But not only did they not accept the report of the Woodward Royal Commission; what they did was to vilify their own royal commissioner. So let them not stand up in this place and talk about their standards of ministerial responsibility. On any other occasion, under any other government, with a royal commissioner bringing down a report like that against a Minister, it would have dismissed the Minister. But no, the members of that Government did not do that; they vilified the royal commissioner.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let me say this just in passing, if the Leader of the Opposition wants me to pick up his point about the standard of this front bench: the Leader of the Opposition says that I talk about its standard. I do not need to. The honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson), the Opposition's shadow Minister for Finance, out of his own mouth, has described this front bench as the most talented since the Second World War. That is the honourable member's statement. He cannot deny it. It is in print, and the honourable member knows it. It is one of the few things he said that are absolutely accurate.

         —Of course it does, Madam Speaker. Any person who has been in this House in the last two or three months and has listened to the succession of honourable members get up here and ask their questions would have been appalled by the nature of those questions. The unstated assumption was that these people about whom we are talking are somehow some second-class citizens who cannot be trusted and to whom different standards have to be applied.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Madam Speaker, let us get it clear that in dealing with the question of Aborigines in this country we are talking about the most disadvantaged group of people in Australia. Let me list the facts which are never acknowledged by those opposite. These are facts which should cause enormous concern to every reasonable person in this country and I should say particularly to every person in this House. I ask honourable members to remember these facts about the Aborigines in this country. Their average life expectancy at birth is 20 years less than that for other Australians. Aboriginal infant mortality, while improving, is still nearly three times that of the rest of Australians. Aboriginal unemployment is six times the national average. The number of Aboriginal people who have never attended school is about 11 times the figure for other Australians. On average Australian Aboriginals earn only half of what other Australians earn. A large proportion of Aboriginal Australian families live in substandard housing or temporary shelter. Aboriginal imprisonment rates are about 20 times that of the national average. Let us remember that, except for nine of the last 39 years, those on the other side of this place have been in government in Australia. If we are to make some assessment of the responsibility for the position of Aboriginal people in this country, we have to remember that overwhelmingly the responsibility for those sad and tragic facts lies with those opposite.
       </para>
       <para>
        So, when we are talking-and I am going to come to the issues about the Minister-let us remember that we are talking about a tragically disadvantaged section of our population, people in respect of whom we have to be prepared to make considerable allowances. In none of the questions that have been directed towards the Minister which have raised questions of responsibility has any allowance been made about these facts at all. I repeat-and I will continue to repeat-that, when we are talking about Aboriginals in this country, we have to be prepared to make allowances for them that we would not make for any other section of the Australian people. Anyone who does not understand that fact is totally lacking in any sense of charity or decency.
       </para>
       <para>
        Having said that, I repeat, as I have said so often during this year, that it does not mean when we acknowledge those tragic facts about the Aboriginal people, that we should have some collective sense of national guilt. We should not. But it certainly does mean that we should assume a sense of mutual national responsibility. That is precisely why just some four months ago I introduced into this Parliament a motion which dealt with the relationship between the Australian nation and its Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander citizens. You will recall, Madam Speaker, that that was a motion which emanated from the desire of the heads of the Australian churches that there should be put on record by this Parliament a statement of the position of the Parliament regarding the Aboriginal people.
       </para>
       <para>
        One can assess the attitude of members of the Opposition to the whole question of Aborigines in this country by the despicable attitude which they adopted on that occasion. You will recall, Madam Speaker, that that gave rise to the most severe condemnation by the heads of the Catholic Church in this country about the attitude of the Opposition to the Aborigines in this country. That action establishes the basis from which the people opposite approach this whole question. I content myself simply with the statement of Archbishop Francis Carroll. He said:

        Some view the resolution as an empty token. I prefer to see it as a powerful symbol. The great meanings of life and history can often be expressed only in symbols that contain inner substance and imply active commitment. I believe that this action of the Federal Parliament represents a truer recognition of the past, a present desire for reconciliation and a promised commitment to a more just future.

        And, in those circumstances, Father Frank Brennan condemned in the most severe language-and I do not use stronger language than that-the amendment moved by and the attitude of the Opposition. So, Madam Speaker, we come to a consideration of this motion in the knowledge that the Opposition is on record as having a totally despicable attitude to the question of Aborigines in this country.
       </para>
       <para>
        Having said that, I make the point in regard to this motion, which springs from that attitude of the people opposite, that, on the issue of ministerial responsibility and the attitude of this Minister, I attach the highest importance to ministerial integrity. I have spoken at length with the Minister; I have reviewed the relevant documents; and I have concluded on the basis of those discussions and of that examination that there should be complete confidence in Mr Hand as Minister.
       </para>
       <para>
        The facts that have emerged are clear cut. On the question of NAIHO funding, I am satisfied that no decision has been made by the Minister and that he did not, therefore, mislead the Parliament. On the question of the audit report, I have already made it clear, and the Minister agrees, that he could have been more precise in the language that he used. But he did not in any sense have any intention to mislead the Parliament. There was-to use the words of the Opposition's senatorial colleague, Senator Durack-`no guilty mind'. All of the actions and all of the attitudes exhibited by the Minister are consistent entirely with those tests which I laid down in the Garran oration to which the Leader of the Opposition referred.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is no doubt that, in the presence and in the person of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Mr Hand, the Opposition has someone who constitutes for it an extreme danger because no-one in this House and no-one in this country can seriously question the integrity or the commitment of Gerry Hand-no-one! Indeed, that is a problem for this Opposition.
       </para>
       <para>
        This area of Aboriginal affairs has been for every government since Federation one of the most complex, difficult and tragic areas. In Gerry Hand, not only the Aboriginal community but also the people of Australia as a whole, have a person who beyond measure and who, beyond comparison, has committed himself with integrity to the defence and the advancement of the Aboriginal people of this country in a way in which this Government is proud, with which the Aboriginal people are satisfied and of which the Australian nation as a whole should be thoroughly grateful. He has not only my confidence, Madam Speaker; he has the total confidence of this Government and, I believe, overwhelmingly he has the confidence of the Aboriginal community as he properly should.

         —I rise to second this motion. Madam Speaker, it is 9.24 p.m. on the last sitting day of this Parliament in this year of our Bicentennial celebration. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has come into this place and spent the first five minutes of his 15-minute speech castigating the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) about his speech, not mentioning one thing about the topic which is before the House. This House had its Question Time suspended today. The sittings of this House today were suspended for a total of 1 1/2 hours because the Government did not have any business to be carried out in the Parliament. Here we are with the Prime Minister spending 12 minutes before he even reaches the topic before us at this stage, which is a censure of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Hand).

        The situation is that, in a parliamentary democracy such as ours, the trust of Ministers is a vital principle. The information which is given to this Parliament, whether it be in the other House or this House, is absolutely vital for the functioning of a democracy. What we have seen today is the trust of this House being betrayed. The Leader of the Opposition said that we wanted candour and honesty. I say to Government members politically, keep the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs where he is. We do not mind. Keep him there, because that is the situation we prefer him to be in. While Minister Hand is in that position, information will flow to the Opposition and there will continue to be chaos and maladministration in the area of Aboriginal Affairs.

        What we want the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs to do tonight is to address the issues which are before the House. We do not want him to come in here and give us all the facts about the situation which the Aboriginal people face in Australia. We have had that from the Prime Minister and we have it every time the Minister speaks. What we want the Minister to do is to address those issues which we raise here tonight. I refer to ministerial responsibility before I address some of those issues of the National Aboriginal and Islander Health Organisation (NAIHO) and the failed ability of this Minister in regard to administration of Aboriginal affairs.

        I refer to a book entitled The Politics of Australian Democracy written by Professor Emmy of Monash University. He wrote:

       <para>
        Whitlam thereby confirmed that the sanction of resignation was brought because of the Minister's indiscretion in misleading the Parliament, not because of improper, illegal or corrupt conduct. It is not necessary to suggest that there has been improper, illegal or corrupt conduct. It is only necessary that the Parliament should have been misled.
       </para>
       <para>
        Now, that is a very clear, simple, unequivocal statement. That is why we are debating this issue here tonight. The Parliament on at least two occasions has been misled by this Minister. Any objective observer of these events over the last few weeks would agree with that statement. The book continues:
       </para>
       <para>
        Responsible government requires a high standard of integrity. The ancient maxim that those who rule others should first be able to rule themselves is still relevant. Those entrusted with public office need to be excessively scrupulous in their public behaviour because public contempt for an individual Minister may easily produce contempt for his authority and his office.
       </para>
       <para>
        This is the contempt that we have before us tonight. People will be concerned about the authority of this Minister. Contempt exists for this Government and its handling of Aboriginal affairs.
       </para>
       <para>
        We have heard what the Prime Minister said in his speech in the Robert Garran Memorial Lecture. I am not going to go back over that. But this is what the Governor-General designate said on 28 April 1982:
       </para>

        Then we have the honourable member for Parramatta (Mr John Brown), who has been referred to already tonight. He said:
       </para>
       <para>
        Because of my respect for the institution of Parliament I feel that I have no alternative in all the circumstances but to resign as a Minister.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is exactly what this Minister should do. He should show respect for the institution of Parliament. He should offer his resignation to the Prime Minister.

        Let us move on to the actual proceedings of NAIHO. This all began in answer to a question on 8 November when Minister Hand said in regard to recommencing funding, `I am yet to make a decision'. But then we find that on 5 September there was a record of the proceedings of a senior officers meeting in which it was reported and written that on 31 August the Minister directed that NAIHO receive $180,000 this year in funding.

         —Before his answer, as the honourable member for Menzies says. Let us think about that situation. There was a situation in which the Minister spoke with officials from NAIHO. He did not have one of his departmental officers with him. He preferred to keep them out of the whole discussion. That is typical of the way in which the Minister has administered Aboriginal affairs over the last 18 months. He freezes out the Department and does not have anything to do with it. Then we have the Minister coming out of that meeting with the NAIHO officials and instructing Mr McDonald as to what had happened. We can understand that, at a meeting like that where discussions had been going on, sometimes it is not always clear as to just what has been decided on. But not in this case. The Minister came out and gave a clear instruction to Mr McDonald.

        The fascinating thing about this scenario and saga is that after the question was asked by the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Shipton) the Minister had to call together his officers and check whether his answer in the Parliament was in accord with the record.

        Let me make it quite clear from the outset that I have absolutely no doubt that, at the end of his meeting of 31 August with NAIHO, the Minister has decided to fund NAIHO with effect from 1 December.

I give one more quote from Mr McDonald.
       </para>
       <para>
        I should also say that my recollection of the 8 November telephone conversation was that the Minister's only concern was whether his answer may have misled Parliament in any way. He did not at any stage ask me if I believed my note for the file was an accurate record. Had he done so I would certainly have made it clear that it was.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is his clear recollection of that situation. The Opposition wants the Minister to address these issues. Why was it necessary for the meeting of 8 November to be held? Why was it that the minutes of that meeting were dated 1 December, the last day on which we sat and the day on which we asked another question? We are familiar with the details of NAIHO and prior knowledge. That has been debated at length in the Senate.
       </para>
       <para>
        I want to go on to the second part of this censure motion. What we have today is a failure by this Minister to administer Aboriginal affairs in an effective and efficient manner. For the Prime Minister to come in here and say that we are impugning Aboriginal people around Australia by undertaking the type of questioning which we have undertaken in this Parliament is absolute bunkum and absolute nonsense. The Government, the Prime Minister and the Minister know it. They only want to try to shed the blame for their irresponsible attitude to Aboriginal affairs by claiming that we are blaming Aboriginal people. We are not and we have not intended to do so. We believe it is our responsibility as an opposition to question the accountability of funds given by taxpayers for use to assist the most disadvantaged people in this nation of ours.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Minister in his approach to Aboriginal affairs has sacked eight ADC commissioners. He appointed a new board whose decisions are a litany of disaster. We saw reports of that in the Canberra Times only last week. There are situations in which people appointed to that board have a conflict of interest. We know the debate which occurred about the Woden Town Club. The type of administration we have here is one in which the Minister likes to differentiate between the Government giving money and giving a guarantee and a grant for money. Whether it be a grant, a loan or a guarantee it could ultimately all end up being paid.
       </para>
       <para>
        Then, of course, we have had the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission disaster. There was narrow consultation. He never consulted the State governments and never consulted farming organisations.

I resent the fact that accusations have been made by some of the people who are sitting in the gallery and who reside over the other side of this building, who have cast aspersions on very senior officers of my Department and made accusations against them. On behalf of those people I make the point here: there was no coercion by me of them and no standing over of Mr McDonald. His own diary reference on that day is an example of what I am saying.

There are often more wide-ranging statements made than in normal debate in the House. It might help the debate, if the honourable member for Higgins is offended, for the Minister to withdraw. The Minister can then conduct his defence rather than being held up by points of order.

People have been accused of working for the Labor Party. The person who happened to work for the Labor Party was the Director of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs (DAA) in Western Australia. Somebody stole a document out of his drawer, sent it over to the Senate, and it was read out. What was not taken out was the letter from the Liberal Party asking him to have a look at its policy as well. So he is a Labor Party stooge-a person who worked for a long time for the Aboriginal people of this country. The Opposition has made a whole range of personal attacks on the eight commissioners that I appointed mid-year, accusations that will not hold up. For the Opposition's information, their lawyer has sought an appearance by them before the Senate Select Committee on the Administration of Aboriginal Affairs. By golly, I look forward to that.

        A lot of the things that will come out during these inquiries will put an end to the sort of campaign that has been waged by the Opposition. The Paul Kelly article last weekend really started to address what this is all about. It is all about the change in direction that the Government is seeking to bring about in Aboriginal affairs, a change away from a system that has failed Aboriginal people-a system that the Opposition contributed to setting up. That is the point that we are trying to make. Kelly addressed the fundamental question of what we are trying to do.

His comment about the States is untrue. What the Opposition should do with the States is talk to them about its own policy. The States do not like it very much, I can assure the Opposition of that. The point about ATSIC is that it will work and people like those honourable members opposite who have been party to this campaign have denigrated anybody who has jumped up in support of ATSIC. It is extraordinary that a whole range of people who have shown an interest in the development of ATSIC have been denigrated in the way they have in the Senate.

        There has been a range of attacks on individuals. I guess that the Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde of Aboriginal affairs has to be Senator Chaney. Senator Chaney comes to my office and sits there for nearly 2 1/2 hours, congratulates me on certain things that I have carried out that day, and the very next day goes into the Parliament and buckets people that he has told me are doing a great job in their particular functions-the same Senator Chaney that wants a seat from somebody opposite; the same Senator Chaney that walks into the Adelaide Airport and publicly abuses an Aboriginal woman because she is on the Aboriginal Development Commission (ADC); the same Senator Chaney who has gone around this country pretending to support people.

         —Earlier today the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Sinclair) raised as a matter of privilege reported statements of a spokeswoman for the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) in connection with the recall of the House. The right honourable member referred to privilege of freedom of speech in Parliament and referred to relevant statements in House of Representatives Practice and May's Parliamentary Practice and to the importance of protecting the House and members from improper interference and attempts to influence them by threats or actions tending to impair their freedom of action.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I have examined the article mentioned by the right honourable gentleman. It would seem to me that if the report is accurate the nub of the statement is an indication as to what a spokeswoman believed the action of the Government would be in connection with the recall. It foreshadows arrangements for the sitting and the use of certain procedures.
       </para>
       <para>
        Whilst members may deprecate the statement, when considered in context it does not appear of itself to constitute a threat or attempt by the person involved to interfere improperly with the free exercise of the House's functions or the free performance of the members' duties, to use the words of section 4 of the Parliamentary Privileges Act. In my opinion a prima facie case of contempt has not been made out and I am therefore not prepared to give priority to a motion in connection with the matter.

        I do not think there is a need really to spend much time on these matters. They essentially relate to proposals that the Opposition has moved in the Senate which relate to, amongst other things, the circumstances in which a school could appeal against a change in the level of subsidy or to whether or not a school would be disadvantaged as a result of not having signed an agreement by the due date and those sorts of issues. It was never the intention that, for instance, schools would be disadvantaged as a result of not being party to an agreement under circumstances which were beyond the schools' or the authority's control. This has just been spelled out in the Bill. Whilst the other matters do widen the circumstances in which an appeal might succeed-that is, it makes them wider than the Government had intended-in the end the settling of an appeal remains in the hands of the Minister and therefore whilst this will add an administrative burden which we had hoped to dispense with we do not, in the context of the handling of this current Bill, intend to oppose this particular proposal by the State. It might help the House's consideration of the matters if we proceed to the other items. In relation to amendments Nos. 2 and 5, the Government proposes to move a further amendment which will clarify the position. I will not say anything more except to say again that the Government is happy to accept amendments Nos. 1, 3 and 4 as proposed by the Senate

        That amended clause has already been circulated to the Committee. This is rather like the other matters that we have dealt with in this broad debate on education matters and it relates to the extent to which the Schools Council should be involved, firstly in the negotiation of resource agreements between the Commonwealth and the States or the Commonwealth and the non-government school authorities or the extent to which the Schools Council should have a monitoring role in relation to the implementation of those resource agreements. We have proposed, in order to overcome some of the technical defects in the amendments as proposed by the Senate, to move our own amendment which will secure a role for the Schools Council in the monitoring of the implementation of the resources agreement. I would therefore suggest that the House reject amendments Nos 2 and 5 and agree with the Government's amendment which would replace amendment No. 5.

        (c) in the case of government schools, the Schools Council would not be an appropriate body for this purpose given its make-up.
       </para>
       <para>
        The amendment inserting new clause 18B allows for disallowance of administrative guidelines, to be determined in accordance with the new clause, by the Parliament. This approach introduces uncertainty into the consultation and negotiation process with States on agreements. It represents an inappropriate form of Parliamentary scrutiny and unwarranted intrusion into the workings of Government. A legislative requirement to provide information on the processes of Government decision-making, especially the power to intrude into those processes, is unacceptable.

        That amendment No. 3 be agreed to.
       </para>
       <para>
        In Budget Paper No. 1 the Treasurer (Mr Keating) indicated that the Government has decided that the Health Insurance Act 1973 be amended in 1988-89 to remove Medicare benefits in respect of services provided overseas, saving an estimated $5m in 1988-89 and $6m in a full year. The Senate has rejected the amendments to the Health Insurance Act designed to continue the payment of Medicare benefits and medical services provided overseas. The Senate has further considered this question and has resolutely ignored commonsense and confirmed its opposition. The Opposition in the Senate has, in effect, overturned a Budget decision.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government, which has a clear majority in this House and is responsible for setting the financial framework for Government expenditure through the Budget, is not proposing to abrogate this very important responsibility to the Senate. The cost of the Senate rejection of the proposed amendment is not large in relative terms, but this $5m will now have to be found elsewhere within the portfolio of Community Services and Health. But while the Opposition in the Senate has been keen to protect Medicare medical benefits for a few Australians who are able to travel overseas, assistance to needy Australians here in Australia will now go lacking as a result of this move.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Opposition, it would seem, has not recognised that the travellers who become ill and require medical treatment while overseas or, even worse, hospitalisation, are really personally responsible for the often very high medical costs in many countries which are in stark contrast to the very great benefits we have in Australia, both in terms of cost and effectiveness of Medicare and pharmacy benefits. There are already four reciprocal agreements currently in operation-those of the United Kingdom, New Zealand, Italy and Malta-and more are planned.
       </para>
       <para>
        Over the past 12 months the Minister for Community Services and Health (Dr Blewett) has attempted to ensure that the travelling public is better informed as to the need for comprehensive travel insurance which includes overseas health cover in addition to the limited Medicare cover which applied for medical treatment overseas. But in spite of these efforts, it is a fact that some 50 per cent of Australians travelling overseas do so without any form of insurance cover.
       </para>
       <para>
        Unfortunately, because of the opposition in the Senate, including that of the Australian Democrats, we are now in a situation where many people travelling overseas will be continually confused and put themselves at risk, as so many of them do already, by not taking out adequate health and medical insurance. The Government recognises that it would not be appropriate to hold up the Bill at this stage, particularly when many people are travelling. In addition, this Bill contains more than the amendment now before us. It has many other facets which relate to the frail aged and the sick in our community, Medicare, nursing homes and hostels. I hope that the people of Australia recognise that we are dealing with a provision which will cost $5m, most of which will in fact end up in the pockets of insurance companies.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Opposition in the Senate and the Australian Democrats have decided to put at risk the frail aged and the sick. If other important parts of the Bill such as the amendments to Medicare agreements and respite care are to be implemented in an appropriate timeframe, the Government has little option now but to support the amendment. To do otherwise would mean that many thousands of Australians-the frail aged and the sick in this country who depend on Medicare, Government assistance to nursing homes and hostels, the home community care programs and other important programs-would be put at risk for the sake of $5m for insurance companies and people travelling overseas. At the appropriate time, the Government will consider the impact of the amendments made in the Senate and may bring forth appropriate amendments to achieve the Government's objectives in this area.

         —I am glad to know that even at this late hour the Government can see a bit of sense in connection with what has been happening both here and in the Senate over the last couple of weeks. The Minister for Housing and Aged Care (Mr Staples) talked about commonsense and about $5m. Maybe he did listen to the debate that took place in the Senate earlier tonight. A lot of the theories that the Government has put up in connection with this matter being a Budget Bill were destroyed because this Government in opposition in 1976 took exactly the same attitude to Budget Bills that is being taken now.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The Minister talked about the effect that the $5m could have on the frail aged and nursing homes. Nursing homes are already under threat because of massive reductions in assistance. As a result, the care that is required both for the sick in hospital and for the frail aged in the nursing homes will be seriously impaired. When the Minister talks about the $5m additional cost that will result from this amendment, he ignores altogether the commonsense of the argument that many Australians still pay the Medicare levy while they are overseas. These people will be denied their basic rights-rights that they are already denied in terms of the differences between doctors' fees and the Medicare schedule fee.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Minister also ignores the fact that this year the Government has wasted $50m of taxpayers' funds in trying to subvert the wishes of the people in regard to constitutional referendums. So the argument advanced in regard to the Constitution has no validity-the matter of principle raised by the Minister is not worthy of consideration. Instead of guillotining legislation in the first place, the Government should have been prepared to listen to the reasoned debate that was put forward. Instead, it has had to come into this place late at night and, after a massive waste of time paid for by the taxpayers of Australia, agree to the amendment.

        —The answer to the honourable member's question, directed to the former Minister, is as follows:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) and (2) The Department closed the flight service facility at Lord Howe Island on 31 December 1987. Services are now provided remotely from Sydney.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) There are currently no plans to close the Norfolk Island flight service facility. Norfolk Island is an international airport with regular public transport jet aircraft operations from both Australia and New Zealand which requires a manned Flight Service Unit to be operational on the Island.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) (a) There is no and has been no Air Traffic Control Service provided at either location;
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) (b) Movements for the financial year 1986-87 were:
      </para>
      <para>
       Lord Howe Island, 3,522
      </para>
      <para>
       Norfolk Island, 2,014;
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) (c) Lord Howe Island has Beech 200 and PA31 type aircraft operations on a Supplementary Airline Licence whereas Norfolk Island has international F28 and B737 jet operations on full Regular Public Transport Licence.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) Supplementary Airline Licence operations utilising B200 and PA31 type aircraft do not require a manned Flight Service Unit nor do they require a Remote Aerodrome Flight Information Service to be provided. However ICAO recommends the establishment of a manned Aerodrome Flight Information Service as a basis for the operation of international services. This service is provided by the Flight Service Unit located on Norfolk Island.
      </para>
      <para>
       As a consequence it has been possible to close the Flight Service Unit on Lord Howe Island but it has been necessary to retain the Norfolk Island facility.
      </para>
      <para>
       (6) Closure of the Lord Howe Flight Service Unit will not involve any compromise to the safety of aviation services to the Island. A Search and Rescue Service will continue to be provided from Sydney as before.
      </para>
      <para>
       (7) Australia's international obligations are not affected by these changes.

      <para>
       The June 1988 issue of `Food Supply situation and Crop Prospects in Sub-Saharan Africa: Special Report', produced by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation's Global Information and Early Warning System on Food and Agriculture, shows that the food supply prospects for Sub-Saharan Africa in 1988 are mixed. The following countries in the region are facing exceptional food emergencies:

       The report provides the following regional food situation forecasts for Sub-Saharan Africa:

      </para>
      <para>
       The threat to 1988 cereal harvests in western and northern Africa from infestations of desert locusts is even greater than anticipated earlier this year. Swarms invaded the Sahelian countries from north-west Africa much sooner than expected, in April and May, and on a scale unprecedented so early in the season. Swarms of locusts have been reported from every country between Cape Verde and Senegal in the west to Sudan in the east. Although it is difficult to be precise, current indications are that 1 to 2 million hectares of cropland could be affected, which could lead to a potential loss of up to 1 million tons of cereals.
      </para>
      <para>
       Severe localised food deficits persist in several Sahelian countries where rains were inadequate in 1987, most notably in Burkina Faso, Chad, Mali and Niger. Following two unusually good harvests in 1985 and 1986, part of the production shortfalls are expected to be met by stock withdrawals. Serious delays have occurred in the mobilisation of resources due to the lack of logistic facilities, communication difficulties and slow donor response. As a result the food supply situation is becoming extremely tight. Reserve stocks are likely to be drawn to dangerously low levels leaving little or no safety margin to cope with shortfalls in 1988 harvests which are seriously threatened by desert locusts.
      </para>
      <para>
       Eastern Africa
      </para>
      <para>
       The overall food situation is satisfactory. However, a number of countries face localised food shortages with the situations in Sudan and Ethiopia being of particular concern.
      </para>
      <para>
       In Sudan the food supply situation is deteriorating rapidly. Acute food shortages and civil strife are causing people to move to the north where the food supply position is already tight. Deaths from starvation have already occurred and efforts are being made to overcome logistic difficulties in the delivery of supplies. Recent rains have improved the prospects for the current harvest but the widespread flooding has disrupted rail and road links seriously impeding the distributing of relief supplies.
      </para>
      <para>
       Serious food shortages continue in Ethiopia with the situation being particularly grave in Eritrea, Tigray, Wollo, Hararghe and parts of Gondar, Shoa and Sidamo. Famine relief supplies are being distributed but severe logistic constraints are causing delays in distribution schedules and food airlifts continue to be necessary. Food aid pledges virtually cover the 1988 food aid needs but port congestion is causing large stocks of food aid to pile up in both Assab and Massawa.
      </para>
      <para>
       Southern Africa
      </para>
      <para>
       The aggregate output of cereals for 1988 is estimated at some 40% above last year's poor production. Nevertheless, Angola and Mozambique face serious food supply difficulties as a result of civil unrest, while in Malawi food assistance is required for the increasing number of Mozambican refugees.
      </para>
      <para>
       In Mozambique nearly 6 million people will need food aid during 1988/89. FAO calculates the aggregate cereal requirement to be 800,000 tons, all of which will have to be provided as food aid. Supplementary food, clothing and medical supplies are also urgently required. Civil strife has intensified in recent months putting increasing strain on logistic resources and necessitating the expansion of airlift operations.
      </para>
      <para>
       In Angola an estimated 1.4 million people will need food relief in 1988/89. Below average cereal harvests over the last few years mean that both commercial imports and food aid will have to meet an estimated aggregate cereal requirement of 408,000 tons.
      </para>
      <para>
       Central Africa
      </para>
      <para>
       The overall food supply situation appears satisfactory. External assistance is being received from the purchase and distribution of local supplies of rice.

        —The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) There were two general elections for the National Aboriginal Conference, on 12 November 1977 and 17 October 1981. Until 27 September 1980 Tasmania was included with rural Victoria in the one NAC electorate, VCB, when an election was held for NAC area TSA to provide separate representation for Tasmania. There were also three by-elections; on 27 April 1979 for the QEA area, on 5 July 1983 for the QEH area and on 27 October 1984 for the TSA area.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) The schedules attached list all persons elected to the National Aboriginal Consultative Committee and the National Aboriginal Conference and include:
      </para>
      <para>
       (a) the areas which these people represented in each State and the Northern Territory. (Copies of the maps setting out NACC and NAC areas have been provided to the honourable member and also to the Parliamentary Library), and
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) the dates of their periods of service.
      </para>
      <para>
       In relation to 2 (c), the attached schedule for the NACC also includes positions held and the periods the positions were occupied, obtained from information published in the Report of the Committee of Inquiry into the Role of the National Aboriginal Consultative Committee (Hiatt Report 1976). However, there was a firm policy that the NAC operated independently from the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and the NAC did not always provide the information which would facilitate a full and accurate response to this part of the question in regard to the NAC.

       (2) At the Trade and Development Board Meeting held in late April/early May 1988, a topic of particular interest to Australia was that covered under Agenda Item 2, Protectionism and Structural Adjustment. The Australian delegation delivered a statement expressing disappointment at the lack of any real progress in the previous twelve months in the area of trade liberalisation and calling for fundamental reform of trade distorting policies. Emphasis was placed on the need to address agricultural trade problems in the multilateral framework of the Uruguay Round and the importance in achieving results at the mid-term review to be held in Montreal in December 1988. The delegation also introduced the concept of the Effective Rate of Assistance (ERA) as a useful way in which to assess the protective effect of a range of different tariff and non-tariff measures.
      </para>
      <para>
       Australia's early intervention helped to set the tone for a useful review of protectionism and structural adjustment and issues in the Uruguay Round, with a considerable number of delegations from both developed and developing countries taking the opportunity to present their views.
      </para>
      <para>
       I have arranged for the honourable member to receive a copy of Australia's statement on Protectionism and Structural Adjustment and an information paper circulated by Australia to members of the Board on use of the Effective Rate of Assistance for measuring the impact of trade protection.
      </para>
      <para>
       Under Agenda Item 6, the Australian delegation pushed successfully for early access to the UNCTAD data base on non-tariff measures in order to improve countries' ability to obtain objective information on market access conditions.
      </para>
      <para>
       On other agenda items, the Australian delegation worked closely with other Group B countries and Australia's views are reflected in the statements made on behalf of Group B. These statements, together with the outcomes of the discussion under each agenda item can be found in the ``Report of the Trade and Development Board on the Second Part of its Thirty-Fourth Session'' and I have also arranged for a copy of this report to be made available to the honourable member.

        —The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) Yes. Sealed americium-241 sources are integral components of automatic inspection systems used in the bottling and canning sections of the food industry to monitor the level of contents in containers on high speed filling lines. The instruments are not used in the preparation and processing side of the food industry.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) (a) No. the level of radiation exposure of food or beverages from sealed of americium-241 used in inspection systems is completely insignificant and poses no public health risk. The level of radiation dose received by each can or bottle is estimated to be about 10-8 Gray, which is less than that received from naturally occurring cosmic radiation over an hour.
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) The use of small radioactive sources for inspection purposes in the food and beverage industry does not result in any processing of the food and so the National Health and Medical Research Council Model Food Standards Regulation, S3 Irradiation of Food, is not applicable. The irradiation of food for preservation or disinfestation involves maximum average absorbed doses of up to 10,000 Gray.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) The safe use of sealed sources of americium-241 is subject to the provisions of the relevant legislation controlling the use of radioactive substances in each State.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) See (3) above.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) Based on the above, I see no reason to take any further action on this matter.

        —The Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       Transport of spent nuclear fuel is perceived by some as a high risk operation more dangerous than transporting hazardous materials such as chlorine gas, inflammable liquids or acids. In fact, spent fuel has been transported for millions of kilometres over land and sea for more than 25 years with no accidental release of radioactivity, serious injury or death. This compares with hundreds of injuries sustained each year from the transport of other hazardous materials and thousands of people evacuated as a result of spills from transport accidents involving non-nuclear hazardous materials.
      </para>
      <para>
       (1) Yes. The municipalities with nuclear free zones could include Bankstown, Botany, Canterbury, Leichhardt, Marrickville and City of Sydney.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) The safety of radioactive material transported by road and rail within Australia is subject to the legislative requirements of the relevant State or Territory. The Government notes that radioactive materials are transported through nuclear free municipalities on a daily basis.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) All local governments between Lucas Heights and the ports of Sydney and Botany have been advised of the spent fuel transport and invited to discuss the transport operation.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) Yes. Transport of spent fuel from the Brookhaven National Laboratory was halted from 1976 to 1985 by the city of New York. I understand this matter has now been resolved and shipments are proceeding.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) No. See (2).
      </para>
      <para>
       (6) The cask is securely held within a shipping container. The maximum permissible level of radiation at 2 metres from the shipping container is 0.1 millisieverts/hour (10 millirem/hr).
      </para>
      <para>
       (7) Officers of unions with members involved in the transport have held discussions with the relevant Federal and State officials responsible for the safety of the operation, which will be conducted in full accordance with the stringent levels of safety embodied in the Australian Code of Practice for the Safe Transport of Radioactive Substances and the Regulations of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) for the Safe Transport of Radioactive Materials. The Code of Practice and Regulations ensure that external radiation levels from the cask are consistent with current international radiation protection standards and pose a negligible risk to workers or members of the public.
      </para>
      <para>
       (8) No. In view of the high standards of safety and the precautions taken, as in (7) and (33), no special training is considered necessary.
      </para>
      <para>
       (9) See (8).

       (11) One. There will be four shipments.
      </para>
      <para>
       (12) 114-120 fuel elements for each shipment.
      </para>
      <para>
       (13) The total weight of the cask (including the shipping container) is 24 tonnes.

      <para>
       (14) One low loader and prime mover.

      <para>
       (15) See (14)
      </para>
      <para>
       (16) The cask has been purpose designed and manufactured in the USA for the transport of spent fuel from Lucas Heights and is owned by ANSTO. It is constructed of stainless steel with lead as additional radiation shielding.
      </para>
      <para>
       (17) No. The Castor cask is too large, weighing about 100 tonnes. It is designed for the transport and storage of spent fuel from nuclear power stations.
      </para>
      <para>
       (18) See (16).
      </para>
      <para>
       (19) The cask has an insured value of $US750,000.
      </para>
      <para>
       (20) The cask manufacture was completed in 1988.
      </para>
      <para>
       (21) More than 15 years.
      </para>
      <para>
       (22) Yes. Both State and Commonwealth security officers will be involved. In terms of training, see (8).
      </para>
      <para>
       (23) Yes. I understand that United States authorities have decertified a number of designs for some old and out-moded casks that may no longer comply with current US regulations.
      </para>
      <para>
       (24) No. The approval of casks presently used in the US is based on a combination of physical testing and analysis techniques including full scale tests, scale model tests and computer simulation.
      </para>
      <para>
       (25) As indicated above, the ANSTO cask has been purpose designed and manufactured in accordance with the current IAEA Regulations for the Safe Transport of Radioactive Material.
      </para>
      <para>
       (26) A commercial container vessel.

       (29) The reprocessing facilities of the US Department of Energy at Savannah River or Idaho Falls.
      </para>
      <para>
       (30) The material will be transferred to the United States under the Australia/United States Safeguards Agreement as elaborated in an exchange of notes concluded on 2 August 1985. This will ensure that all nuclear material recovered as a result of reprocessing the spent fuel will remain solely in peaceful use.
      </para>
      <para>
       (31) A road accident involving another truck travelling at high speed followed by a fire. Even in this unlikely event, the possibility of any release of radioactive material is extremely remote. In over 25 years of worldwide spent fuel transport there has never been an accident that has released radioactive material and there have been no serious injuries or deaths as a result of the radioactive nature of the material.
      </para>
      <para>
       (32) No. The amount of $25m is the maximum amount of insurance commercially available in Australia for this purpose. Liability associated with the fuel while it is in Australian jurisdiction rests with the Commonwealth. The insurance policy only minimises the financial risk to the Commonwealth.
      </para>
      <para>
       (33) The transport will be under police escort and an officer of the NSW Department of Health will accompany the transport from Lucas Heights to the wharf. Officers of the NSW Department of Health and ANSTO will be available to provide any necessary specialist assistance.
      </para>
      <para>
       (34) The route has not yet been chosen, but will be selected at the time of transport on the basis of prevailing physical security and traffic requirements.

        —The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) According to UNICEF's State of the World's Children Report 1988-
      </para>
      <para>
       (a) an estimated 14 million child deaths occurred in 1987
      </para>
      <para>
       malnutrition was a contributing cause in approximately one third of the child deaths
      </para>
      <para>
       the majority of child deaths could have been avoided by prevention and low-cost treatments
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) approximately 5 million of the child deaths were due to diarrhoeal diseases.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Yes
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) UNICEF estimates that 3.5 million child deaths due to diarrhoeal diseases could have been averted through prevention or treatment with low cost oral rehydration therapy. Prepared packets of oral rehydration salts or solutions using locally available ingredients vary in cost but are generally quite inexpensive.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) It is not possible to give a precise figure for expenditure on child survival and development within health sector activities. Many projects in the health field impact broadly on communities without being targeted at particular age groups.
      </para>
      <para>
       Total bilateral Official Development Assistance (ODA) expenditure on health in 1987/88 was approximately $11.3 million. There was a substantial emphasis on primary health care and maternal and child health in this expenditure.
      </para>
      <para>
       In addition, ODA contributions to multilateral and international agencies active in the health sector include $3.1 million to UNICEF, and a further $0.65 million to the United Nations Fund for Population Activities; $6.3 million to the World Health Organisation (of which the Department of Community Services and Health provided $4.8 million); and $0.9 million and $0.62 million to other international health and population programs respectively.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) In September 1987, the Government approved a strategy for improving the visibility, focus and programming of Australian health sector assistance. WATCH (Women And Their Children's Health) has been adopted as the health sector theme.
      </para>
      <para>
       In support of the strategy, the 1988/89 budget included $3.1 million for the first year of a four-year package of health initiatives (totalling approximately $20 million). Activities will be directed primarily towards the countries of the South Pacific and South East Asia and will also include assistance for international organisations such as UNICEF and WHO. Priority is being given to activities which support the WATCH theme-such as immunisation activities which promote improved primary health care systems, as well as integrated community-based primary health care projects.
      </para>
      <para>
       The health initiatives provide an immediate boost to the level of health assistance while complementing longer-term efforts aimed at incorporating health activities in mainstream aid programs. Thus aid expenditure on primary health care activities is expected to increase, assisting child survival and development while also benefiting women who are the primary child-carers.

       (1) On 8 December 1985 the then Minister for Resources and Energy determined that the proposal to transport spent fuel rods from Lucas Heights would not have a significant effect on the environment in terms of Section 5 (1) of the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act. In his press statement of 17 December 1985 the Minister for Resources and Energy said that as spent fuel transport had been carried out overseas for over 25 years, involving thousands of transport movements without any environmental impact, the transport of spent fuel rods from Lucas Heights will not present any adverse environmental implications.

       (a) The Security Agreement between the United States and the Australian Department of Defence which came into effect on 29 August 1950. The agreement was amended in 1952 (to enable US classified information to be passed to the Department of Defence Production), in 1956 (to enable Australia to pass US classified information to private contractors for military purposes, subject to conditions) and in 1968 (to reflect the transfer of munitions production from the Department of Defence Production to the Department of Supply and to enable transfer of US classified information to the Department of External Affairs and Australian Government authorities having a need to know). Arrangements under that agreement are in place.

        —The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) The current advertising campaign continues to address both the recruitment of the Army Reserve (ARes) and the retention of the ARes. In the case of RAN Reserve, no national campaign is conducted but each Port Division can advertise in local media to fill specific billets. RAAF Reserve does not advertise nationally and can maintain strength by offering Reserve positions to selected permanent RAAF who have elected to take their discharge. RAAF Reserve sometimes advertises in local media to fill unskilled positions.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Army has indicated that the campaign will need to continue if ARes strength is to reach its revised strength of 26,000.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) Actual expenditure on the ARes campaign to June 1988 was: FY1985/86-$2.623m, FY1986/87-$2.562m and FY1987/88-$2.55m.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) (a) Market Force (previously called Creative Oasis) of Sydney devised and implemented the campaign. MOJO-MDA Pty Ltd are the booking agents for clearing media and MPS Advertising Pty Ltd are the booking agents for magazines and newspapers.
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) The total cost of the campaign for FY1988/89 is $2.856m which includes Special To Unit (STU) advertising of $0.5m.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) The net monthly change in ARes strength since the campaign began is shown in the following table. RAN Reserve and RAAF Reserve strengths vary from nil up to 30 people each month.
      </para>
      <para>
       (6) The target strength of the ARes remains at 30,000 however an interim target of 26,000 has been allotted as a minimum to meet current operational tasks. RAN Reserve has a target strength of 1,954. RAAF Reserve has a target strength of 1,500.
      </para>
      <para>
       (7) High rates of wastage in the ARes have caused the primary target of 30,000 to be unachievable in the shorter term. The interim target of 26,000 is expected to be achieved by June 1992 if wastage can be kept at or below 6,700 per annum. The RAN Reserve target should be achieved by June 1993; RAAF Reserve by January 1990.
      </para>
      <para>
       (8) ARes strength has exceeded 30,000 on several occasions. The most recent being July 1981 until June 1984. The advertising campaigns of FY 1985/86 to 1987/88 slowed and then reversed the underachievement that commenced in 1984. In conjunction with the campaigns, Army has improved administrative/management procedures for processing recruits and has raised Recruiting Units in each State. Positive benefits are resulting from integration of the ARA and ARes where more Regular Army members are joining the ARes when they elect to take their discharge. The targets and upper limit of the ARes are the same but with the interim target of 26,000 in force until June 1992 unless the target is achieved earlier. Both RAN Reserve and RAAF Reserve expect their targets to be achieved.
      </para>
      <para>
       (9) The projected active ARes strengths as at 31 October 1988 are set out below. The recording of personnel as efficient/non-efficient occurs as at 30 June each year with some delay before all results are received.
      </para>
      <para>
       (a) Active ARes-24,666 comprising: Efficient-17,181; Non-Efficient-2,972 and not recorded-4,513.
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) 26,000 by June 1992 or earlier.
      </para>
      <para>
       (c) 26,000 by June 1992 or earlier. The current strength of the RAN Reserve is 1,408 and the RAAF Reserve is 1,353.

      <para>
       (4) The contract to supply the aircraft did not go out to tender, but instead resulted from an offer made by Boeing to the Commonwealth. Certificate of Exemption procedures for sole source purchases were followed. The reason given in the request for a Certificate of Exemption was that the subject aircraft were the sole source of available supply. B707 aircraft were sought because of a commonality requirement with the existing RAAF B707 fleet, and the aircraft in Naples were the only aircraft available possessing enough remaining life for RAAF life-of-type purposes.

       (5) The contract price for the acquisition was $US8.775.000, comprising $US6,850,000 for the two operational aircraft and $US1,925,000 for the aircraft to be converted to spares. Additional project costs, to the value of about $A13m, were, or will be, incurred in inspecting the aircraft, maintenance of components, installations of additional equipment, eg Auxiliary Power Units and procurement of Ground Support Equipment, documentation etc.

       (1) Cheeses identified in Europe as having been contaminated with Listeria monocytogenes were investigated as it was possible they had been imported into Australia.

       (4) All State and Territory Health Departments and possible importers were notified of these recalls and took appropriate action to remove all contaminated products from the market. In the case of imported cheeses, the majority of the product was seized at the Customs barrier or from importers' warehouses. However when the affected product had been released for retail sale it was recovered by importers' sales representatives; this action was monitored by State and Territory Health Departments. In the case of Australian ricotta cheese, recall to retail level was ordered and monitored by State Dairy authorities. In view of these steps taken, State and Territory Health Departments did not consider a recall from the public was necessary. There have been no adverse health effects recorded in Australia.

       The report contained more than 170 recommendations. At the time of the report's release many of its proposals and the facilities in question were already under review within Defence or were projects which had been initiated or were being further developed; for example, the Government's position on the two ocean navy and facilities developments at HMAS STIRLING were presented in my statement of the Fleet Base Relocation Study Report on 25 February 1987.

        —On 13 October 1988 (Hansard, page 1593) the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) asked the Acting Treasurer a question without notice as to whether the real rate of return after tax on a savings bank account paying, say, 11 per cent interest, for a wage earner facing a marginal tax rate of 40 per cent is close to zero. The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       In the circumstances described, the real rate of return after tax would currently be close to zero. Historically, that has long been the case with such accounts. Indeed, prior to the deregulation of financial markets, it was not uncommon for the real rate of return after tax, on such accounts, to be negative.
      </para>
      <para>
       Since deregulation, there is a much broader range of investments available (including from banks) to smaller investors, many of which offer noticeably higher rates of return. Some investors continue to favour lower-yielding investments because of their perceived greater security and liquidity.

      </para>
      <para>
       The Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:
      </para>
      <para>
       (1) The Army Psychology Corps has been continuously used and is still used by the Antarctic Division to conduct psychological screening and assessment of applicants for selection as members of Australian National Antarctic Research Expeditions.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) It is not correct that the psychological assessment function has been contracted out to Dalmau and Associates Pty Ltd. Dalmau and Associates Pty Ltd has been engaged by the Antarctic Division in the capacity of management consultants, working on a number of projects, including the expeditioner selection process. Amongst other initiatives, the consultant raised concern about the suitability of the Army psychology test. Accordingly, the Division decided to examine the use of alternative tests. A separate consulting company, ``Appraisal into Development Services'', was engaged to conduct a different test, which was first used in 1987 and was used in parallel with the Army psychology tests in May 1988 during the selection process for Station Leaders for 1988-89. The tests conducted by the consultant were not part of the screening process. Rather, they were used to develop a data base on which decisions could be made as to which test is the most suitable for screening purposes. The test evaluation program was conducted in consultation with the Army Psychology Corps. The Antarctic Division has since decided not to continue with the tests by ``Appraisal into Development Services'', and they were not used for general expeditioner screening for 1988-89. Following discussions between the Division and the Army Psychology Corps, and at the request of the Antarctic Division, the Army has added an additional screening test which was introduced in 1988 for the 1988-89 expedition, for evaluation purposes.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) The contractual arrangement which the Antarctic Division had with ``Appraisal into Development Services'' provided that the consultant be paid $800 per eight hour day; air travel, ground transport in Hobart and accommodation to be arranged by and for the account of the Antarctic Division; incidental expenses to be paid at the rate applicable to those components of the travelling allowance payable to senior executive officers of the Australian Public Service and other expenses approved by the Director to be reimbursed on receipt or claim from the consultant. The consultant did not stay at the Sheraton.
      </para>
      <para>
       Under the contract with Dalmau and Associates Pty Ltd the consultant has been provided with a self drive car, which, on one occasion, was a Commonwealth self drive car provided through the Department of Administrative Services. The provision of this car was within public service guidelines, since Mr Dalmau was on Commonwealth business, and it was to the advantage of the Commonwealth, being cheaper than providing a driver or hiring a car commercially. The consultant pays his own accommodation from within his travelling allowance.

      <para>
       (1) Yes. I am aware of the book. It contains many statements and questions recently repeated in the Parliament and in the media. It presents only one view of the transport of nuclear fuel. The book was published in 1983.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Tests were first specified in the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) Regulations for the Safe Transport of Radioactive Materials in 1964 and have been successively reviewed and revised in 1967, 1973, 1979 and 1985. The ANSTO cask has been designed in accordance with the 1985 edition of the IAEA Regulations which form the basis for the safe transport of virtually all radioactive materials throughout the world. The design of the cask has been reviewed by the relevant Australian competent authority, the Department of Transport and Communications.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) The IAEA Regulations specify a thermal test equivalent to a package being fully engulfed in a fire of sufficient extent to provide an average emissivity coefficient of at least 0.9 and an average flame temperature of at least 800*C (1472*F) for a period of at least 30 minutes.
      </para>
      <para>
       The specification of the thermal test does not define the characteristics at a particular instant of a worst conceivable fire. Temperatures and heat fluxes can exceed the above figures but, on the basis of exhaustive tests and experience, it has been found that the positioning of a package within a fire; movement with time of the fire source relative to the package; shielding by non-combustible items; wind effects and the massive structure of the package combine so that the average conditions in actual fires do not exceed the above test specification.
      </para>

       (4) This would depend on the particular circumstances but would be not less than 30 minutes.

       Yes. The issue of the different retirement ages for men and women was addressed in the Social Security Review Issues Paper No. 6, Towards a National Retirement Incomes Policy.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government is not considering lowering the age pension eligibility age for men for three major reasons:
      </para>
      <para>
       it would reduce people's opportunity to save for retirement and to accumulate superannuation entitlements. These private provisions for retirement would have to be spread over a longer retirement period;
      </para>
      <para>
       reduction of the age pension eligibility age may provide an incentive for older people in employment to retire, indicate to employers that it is acceptable to compel men to retire at an earlier age and generally lead to a lowering of the usual age of retirement. This would be neither economically desirable nor consistent with the Government's support for the active participation of citizens in the economic and social life of the community; and
      </para>
      <para>
       the cost would be considerable. The estimated cost of lowering the age pension eligibility age for men to 60 in April 1988 was almost $2000m. Population projections indicate that this figure would increase substantially in the future.

       <para in-line="1">
        —The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       The honourable member's question refers to ``Defence offsets contracts''. My response assumes that the honourable member is actually referring to:
      </para>
      <para>
       (a) the total value of Defence contracts placed for new capital equipment in each of the years for which the imported content incurred offsets obligations;
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) the value of offsets obligations incurred in each of the years; and
      </para>
      <para>
       (c) the value of offsets obligations for each year which remain outstanding at September 1988.
      </para>
      <para>
       Up to December 1985 Defence contracts with a significant imported content were subject to the rules of the Australian Industry Participation (AIP) program. A number of elements were aggregated to achieve the desired level of AIP. These were:
      </para>
      <para>
       (a) Australian manufacture of portions of the equipment and final assembly and testing at no additional cost but which reduced the value of the imported content;
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) Designated work where the Commonwealth paid a premium to ensure that sufficient technology capability was established in Australia to provide support for the equipment in service; and
      </para>
      <para>
       (c) Offsets, whereby the overseas supplier placed work in Australia at no cost to the Commonwealth, to stimulate the Australian industry technology base.
      </para>
      <para>
       The records up to December 1985 were maintained on an individual project basis using the AIP obligation and achievement, and did not provide a breakdown into each of those elements.
      </para>
      <para>
       In January 1986 the Government announced a significant redirection and strengthening of the Australian Offsets Policy and since that date broader based records have been maintained which separately identify offsets obligations and achievements.
      </para>
      <para>
       In view of the above, the information requested by the honourable member is provided in Table 1 under the following headings:
      </para>
      <para>
       (1) Contract Value (Column 1)-the total value of Defence contracts placed in each year since 1981 which incurred AIP/offsets obligations.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) AIP/Offsets Obligations (Column 2)-the value of AIP/offsets obligations incurred in relation to Defence contracts placed in each year since 1981.
      </para>
      <para>
       AIP/Offsets Achievement (Column 3)-the AIP/offsets achievement against the obligations as at September 1988. It should be noted that obligations, particularly against major new capital equipment purchases are acquitted over an agreed period related to the type of work and the life of the equipment. This may be several years after completion of the contract.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) Outstanding AIP/Offsets Obligations (Column 4)-the value of AIP/offsets obligations outstanding at September 1988 for each of the years.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Inglis Committee of Review of Offsets, in 1984, made a recommendation to the Commonwealth that details of individual obligations not be disclosed, except in the case of major delinquencies. The Commonwealth accepted the recommendation and considers such details to be Commercial-in-Confidence.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Department of Defence does, however, make publicly available a document entitled `Australian Defence Offsets Program-List of Overseas Suppliers' which lists companies participating in the program. The document is annually updated and provides an indication of the activities from which obligations were incurred and the overall obligation status of a company against its Defence contracts. If the honourable member would like a copy of the document he may obtain one through my office.

       (4) While there has been mutual interchange of information between the Canadian Defence Force Supply Systems Project (CFSS) and SSRP, there has been no identified need to conduct detailed studies into the CFSS project.
      </para>
      <para>
       The primary reason for this is that the CFSS project, which commenced in March 1981, was concerned more with replacing outdated hardware, which had reached processing capacity and software maintenance limits, rather than the `establishment of a unified Services' supply system'. At that time the Australian Department of Defence was in the final stages of commissioning new software and replacement UNIVAC hardware to overcome similar capacity problems which had been experienced by the Department in the mid to late seventies.
      </para>
      <para>
       Subsequent CFSS upgrade activity was aimed at enhancing an existing `unified' system through the introduction of modern software techniques while the SSR project was involved in creating a `common' system from three separate systems. The use of modern software techniques was the primary common factor among the two processes.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) The SSRP will be fully operational by December 1997. However, system implementation will be progressive, with fully operational segments being commissioned according to the following planned schedules:

      <para>
       (1) Yes.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) (a) Yes. As outlined in the overview at Appendix 1 to the Defence Portfolio Explanatory Notes for 1988-89 (Budget Related Paper No. 8.5), Defence has adopted a program structure which has close regard to the Departmental and ADF organisations and functions which contribute to or participate in the development of defence capabilities and objectives. Consistent with this approach the Army, Navy and Air Force subprogram structures are based on their major commands and head office elements. This approach is consistent with the orientation of Program Management and Budgeting to the day-to-day management within Defence.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Army structure differs in that it has separate Commands for logistics and training which are reflected in its component structure. The equivalent functions in Navy and Air Force are embraced by their Support components.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) (b) (c) Yes, in the initial stage of development it was not possible to attribute Appropriation Division 234 to the Navy Combat Force. Much of that expenditure is for stores eg fuel, ammunition and spares procured on a global basis by the Navy Support Command and is correctly attributed to the Navy Support component. When information sources are improved, those Division 234 expenditures incurred on a local basis by the Navy Combat Force will be appropriately attributed. As stated in Appendix 1 to the Defence Portfolio Explanatory Notes for 1988-89, Defence aims to refine and improve its program attributions including those for the Navy Combat Force.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) No, the completion of the transition to program budgeting is not marked by a change in treatment of Division 234. Some elements of program budgeting and associated systems will not be in place until the 1989-90 Budget and others may take even longer. The latter part of the question refers to the process of consolidation of appropriations which has been under way across the Service for a number of years. While not a prerequisite for, it is consistent with the `managing for results' approach being fostered by the Government through measures such as the adoption of Program Management and Budgeting. The consolidation of appropriation items is seen as enhancing the capacity of managers to manage their funds efficiently, and as helping to shift the focus of scrutiny from a detailed examination of inputs towards a consideration of the relationship between the resources south and the expected program outputs and outcomes. Such a shift is consistent with views expressed by both the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Expenditure and the Joint Parliamentary Committee of Public Accounts. As indicated in my reply to Question on notice number 1334, the matter of the provision of more detailed information under Division 234 will be re-examined in the context of the overall effort required to meet other Budget-related information needs.

New Zealand opted to continue after the design selection. The evaluation of the tenders will be completed in the second quarter of 1989. New Zealand's continued participation in the collaborative arrangements is a matter for the New Zealand Government.

       It is considered that the project is viable for Australia on a unilateral basis. The budgetary cost cap per ship set in the Request for Tender should be sufficient to provide 8 ships within the indicative total project cost which would meet the requirements of the Government's Defence White Paper.

        —The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) (a) Australian troops and their equipment embarked for Vietnam from Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth, Adelaide and Townsville. (b) Naval ships loaded with troops and their equipment departed from Sydney, Brisbane, Fremantle, Port Adelaide and Townsville.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Yes, both troops and their equipment, and naval ships loaded with these troops and equipment, travelled through the transit period. The background to the difference in the period of allotment given to the two groups is as follows:
      </para>
      <para>
       In 1965 the Government directed the formation of an Inter-departmental Committee to examine the principles on which eligibility for benefits under the Act should be determined. The Committee recommended that allotment for special duty should only be made when personnel were exposed to potential risk provided by a continuing danger from activities of hostile forces. In making this recommendation, the Committee considered that the responsibility for allotment should remain with the Services, under appropriate direction from the Government as to the ingredients to be present in respect of the danger.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government of the day endorsed this recommendation and following on from this decision, the Secretary, Department of Defence stated in part:
      </para>
      <para>
       ``In the terms of this direction, personnel on temporary duty in `special areas', such as staff visits or other occurrences of a short term nature, are not eligible for allotment for `special service'. The complements of ships or aircraft engaged in conveying or escorting personnel to or from `special areas' are not eligible for allotment.''
      </para>
      <para>
       Personnel in units such as HMAS Sydney, HMAS Boonaroo and MS Jeparit which were engaged in the transport of troops and supplies to Vietnam did not gain allotment for special duty. The presence of these ships in Vietnamese waters was of a temporary nature only, and their service was not considered by Cabinet to warrant the granting of operational benefits. A similar view was taken of other temporary duty visits such as staff visits or ships in transit through Vietnamese waters. On the other hand, the crews of warships which served on the gunline off the coast were allocated for special duty as the ships were sent to Vietnam for operational duties.
      </para>
      <para>
       On 22 May 1986 I stated the Government's decision that all regular service personnel who participated in Australia's involvement in the Vietnam conflict were to be entitled to repatriation benefits and Defence Service Home Loans. The Government has essentially removed the distinctions in benefits that previously existed and which depended on the length of service in Vietnam.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) It is considered that there was no difference in the risk or danger faced by those being carried through the transit area to those transporting them.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) No records exist to confirm or deny that personnel were informed that they would not be allotted for special duty in a special area prior to commencement of a voyage. However, members of HMAS Sydney's crew who are still serving, report that they were aware that their Commanding Officer was making application to the Fleet Commander for a certain number of voyages to count towards the South Vietnamese Campaign medal. In the case of Army, a former Officer Commanding 32 Small Ships Squadron has indicated that ships' crew (Army) were aware of the special provisions before departure for Vietnam.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) Conditions of employment for civilian crews of Jeparit  and Boonaroo are not known and this information will have to be drawn from the Australian National Line (ANL).
      </para>
      <para>
       (6) A copy of Republic of Vietnam Ministry of Defence Order No. 48 dated 24 March 1966 was forwarded to the Secretary of the South Australian Branch of the HMAS Sydney and Vietnam Logistical Support Veterans' Association on 30 August 1988.

       In the reply by Senator Durack to the original question from Senator Mason in 1981, the point was made that a full and detailed reply would disclose defence information prejudicial to national security. That is still the case today. Most of the information provided by Senator Durack is still relevant, and as it is a matter of record in Hansard I will present only those changes which have occurred to that information. The changes are:
      </para>
      <para>
       (a) 5.56mm Weapon System. A new weapon system consisting of individual weapons and a light machine gun is being produced under licence in Australia and will be introduced into service in 1989. It is expected to be fully introduced by 1994 and this new system will replace many of the weapons which were identified in the original question by Senator Mason, namely:

      </para>
      <para>
       (c) HAMEL 105mm gun. A 105mm howitzer is under local production and is entering service in 1988. This gun will replace both of the 105mm guns which are nominated in the original question, that is the 105mm M101 Field howitzer and the 105mm Pack howitzer.
      </para>
      <para>
       (d) The M198 gun of 155mm calibre has been procured from the US and entered service in 1985, replacing the 5.5 inch gun.

       Senator Durack advised that it was policy to manufacture in Australia as much of the ammunition requirements as possible. That is still the policy aim, however for a number of reasons the ammunition for some of these new weapons is procured overseas.'

        —The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) Australia has supported and participated in negotiations aimed at establishing an Antarctic Minerals Convention within the framework of the Antarctic Treaty system. The aim of the negotiations was not to encourage minerals activity in Antarctica, but to ensure that, if exploitation of Antarctic minerals should ever be feasible, effective mechanisms would be in place to protect the environment and to prevent disputes and political discord. The negotiations took place on the basis that Antarctica would remain closed to minerals exploitation unless a specific decision were taken to open it.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government has not yet made a decision on signing the Convention that has emerged from these negotiations. There are different views within the Australian community on its merits and demerits. With that in mind, the text of the Convention was tabled on 22 November to facilitate public discussion before a Government decision on signature is made.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) (a) Consideration of the feasibility of the World Park concept should not be inhibited by the recent conclusion of a Minerals Convention, which has as a major objective the preservation of the Antarctic environment. At this stage however, the Government judges that the obvious interest of some countries in the minerals potential of Antarctica would prevent the necessary consensus agreement by Antarctic Treaty Consultative Parties. An attempt by New Zealand to gain support for such a proposal from fellow Treaty Members in the mid-1970s was not successful. It is unlikely that there will be any significant minerals activity in Antarctica for many years.
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) We see no need for or benefit in any UN mandate to administer Antarctica. The Antarctic Treaty system, which is based on the principles of the United Nations charter, has for thirty years provided an outstanding example of international co-operation in environmental protection and scientific research as well as ensuring that the continent has remained free of military weapons, nuclear explosions, and political contention. Governments representing more than three-quarters of the world's population are now parties to the Treaty. Accession is open to all countries prepared to accept the obligations of the Treaty. Moreover, the Treaty system has shown itself capable of evolving and adapting to meet changing circumstances.

      </para>
      <para>
       (6) Article 79 of the United Nations Charter provides that amendments, and, by implication, termination of a strategic trusteeship agreement should be approved by the Security Council. There is no reason to expect that this procedure will not be followed by the parties concerned at the appropriate time.

       (7) No.
      </para>
      <para>
       (8) No, but I note that small island states commonly suffer the effects of paucity of natural resources which, even with large-scale external assistance, restrict prospects for self-sustaining economic development.
      </para>
      <para>
       (9) Three diesel generators on loan from the U.S. Department of Defence supplied a portion of Palau's electric power. There was also a trailer-based portable system for power generation provided by IPSECO.
      </para>
      <para>
       (10) The U.S. Department of Defence advised the Palau Government after the loan period had expired that it required the return of the diesel generators.
      </para>
      <para>
       (11-13) The IPSECO power plant purchase was a matter essentially falling within the purview of the Government of Palau. I understand that the U.S. had severe doubts as to the wisdom of Palau proceeding with the IPSECO purchase and communicated these doubts to the Palau Government. The U.S. nevertheless advised the U.K. Government that the U.S. supported conceptually the acquisition of a reliable power system by Palau although also indicating clearly that the U.S. was not in any way able to stand as guarantor for the IPSECO loan. The U.S. Government also advised the U.K. Government that, from the U.S. perspective, there was nothing in the proposed Compact of Free Association with Palau that would bar the use of Compact funds to repay the IPSECO loan. This advice was provided when Ambassador Zeder was the U.S. Ambassador for Micronesian Status Negotiations.
      </para>
      <para>
       (14) No.
      </para>
      <para>
       (15) The Australian Government's efforts to support limits on nuclear weapons and their ultimate elimination (including as provided for under the Treaty of Rarotonga) would not be impeded by the Compact of Free Association between Palau and the United States. The U.S. has agreed under the Compact not to use, test, store or dispose of harmful substances, including nuclear weapons and waste, in Palau. Palau has assured the U.S. that in carrying out its responsibilities under the Compact the U.S. has the right to operate nuclear-capable or nuclear propelled vessels and aircraft under the NCND doctrine. Article V of the Treaty of Rarotonga allows individual countries to retain their sovereign right to decide whether to allow visits by foreign ships and aircraft. As Palau is not a member of the South Pacific Forum, it would not fall within the zone of the Treaty of Rarotonga. The Treaty is open for signature only by members of the South Pacific Forum.

      <para>
       (1) (a) In late 1986 and for some months in 1987, investigations were conducted by the Department into alleged irregularities concerning the importation and sale under diplomatic privilege of motor vehicles into Indonesia by staff of the Australian Embassy in Jakarta.
      </para>
      <para>
       (i) Initial investigations were conducted, in accordance with sub-section 61 (2) of the Public Service Act 1922, to determine whether officers of the Australian Public Service at the mission who may have failed to fulfil their duty as officers should be charged with misconduct. As a result of these investigations, a second inquiry was conducted to determine the disciplinary action to be taken against a number of officers.
      </para>
      <para>
       (ii) The investigations were made by a senior officer of the then Department of Foreign Affairs authorised for that purpose under sub-section 61 (2) of the Public Service Act.
      </para>
      <para>
       (iii) The officers investigated were Australia-Based officers at the Embassy in Jakarta and the Consulate in Bali. A member of the locally-engaged staff of the Embassy was also investigated. All Australia-Based Staff at the Embassy in Jakarta and the Consulate in Bali were interviewed in this matter, 57 officers in all. A further 13 officers who had previously served in Indonesia were also interviewed in Australia by the Authorised Officer. The scope of the investigation covered the importation of motor vehicles by Australia-Based Staff into Indonesia since 1982. In the course of the inquiry 133 officers were investigated.
      </para>
      <para>
       (iv) The investigations indicated that officers had in some instances disposed of their motor vehicles otherwise than in accordance with the Indonesian regulations and procedures governing the sale or disposal of vehicles imported into Indonesia under diplomatic privilege.
      </para>
      <para>
       (v) Details of financial benefits to officers resulting from the sale of private diplomatic motor vehicles in Indonesia are matters for the officers concerned and the Australian Taxation Office. Profit-making from transactions involving motor-vehicles is not illegal nor subject to disciplinary measures in itself. The prime consideration is that such transactions are legal and comply with regulations and guidelines. It is true that some officers benefited financially from the purchase and sale of motor-vehicles, but it is also true that some others lost money in such dealings.
      </para>
      <para>
       (vi) As a result of these investigations 11 officers were charged with offences under the Public Service Act and 14 officers were counselled concerning their conduct under the Public Service Act. Two other Departments were asked to consider action in respect of four officers who were not covered by the provisions of the Public Service Act. Ten of the 11 officers charged under the Public Service Act had disciplinary action, taken against them, ranging from deduction from salary to reduction in rank.

      </para>
      <para>
       (i) An investigation was made in response to allegations of improper conduct by individuals concerning the sale of personal motor vehicles in Berlin. The investigation was in two stages. First an officer was authorised under sub-section 61 (2) of the Public Service Act 1922 to determine whether an individual may have failed to fulfil his duty as an officer within the meaning of the Public Service Act and, if so, to decide whether to lay disciplinary charges. The second stage of the investigation was conducted to determine whether the charges were proven.
      </para>
      <para>
       (ii) The investigations were undertaken by a senior officer of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade authorised for that purpose.
      </para>
      <para>
       (iii) The alleged actions of a senior officer at the Embassy in East Berlin were investigated.
      </para>
      <para>
       (iv) The investigating officer determined that the officer did not have a case to answer, but concluded that the result may have differed if the charge had been based on a different provision of the meaning of misconduct by an officer. The original charge had been drafted with legal advice.
      </para>
      <para>
       (v) Details of financial benefits to officers resulting from the sale of private diplomatic motor vehicles are matters for the officers concerned and the Australian Taxation Office. Profit-making from transactions involving motor-vehicles is not illegal nor subject to disciplinary measures in itself. The prime consideration is that such transactions be legal and comply with regulations and guidelines. The initial investigations indicated that financial benefits had not been improperly made by the sale of motor vehicles. It was not therefore within the scope of the inquiry to establish what profits may actually have been made.
      </para>

      <para>
       (1) Yes. Maximum residue limits (MRLs) are established by the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC). The MRLs established by the NHMRC have legal standing when they are adopted into State Food and Drug legislation.

      <para>
       (4) The total number of residue violations detected since May 1987 is not available. During the period 1 July 1987 to 30 June 1988, only 142 samples with residue above the MRL were detected in the 24,339 samples examined in the National Residue Survey which covers an extensive range of chemical/commodity combinations through its screening test procedures.
      </para>
      <para>
       No prosecutions have been made as a result of violative residues detected in the NRS. State authorities are responsible for tracing excessive residues back to the property of origin where further investigations and corrective action are made.

      <para>
       (5) Yes.

      <para>
       (6) Review of existing MRLs is an ongoing function of the NHMRC. They are amended and sometimes rescinded in the light of new toxicological data or when new use patterns are proposed for the parent chemical.

       Freight expenditure is recorded under a separate charge code without distinction between domestic and international freight. It is thus not possible to provide an exact figure on past expenditure for international freight, and estimated expenditure for 1988/89 has similarly been calculated without distinction. A separate charge code for recording the cost of any international freight has not hitherto been introduced because the quantum of such expenditure has not been regarded as sufficient to warrant further complication in the Department's Chart of Accounts. Total expenditure on freight of all types in 1987/88 was $422 709.

       Because of the structure of the Department's chart of accounts it is not possible to separate air freight and sea freight costs.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Department of Administrative Services arranges the shipment of officers' personal effects from Australia. The amounts shown above for shipment to overseas posts include, in addition to freight costs, costs for packing, storage, clearance and domestic freight. These costs are not totalled separately on the accounts submitted by the Department of Administrative Services.
      </para>
      <para>
       From 1 July 1988 the Department of Administrative Services commenced charging for their services. Due to delays in presentation of accounts, the figures for shipment of personal effects to overseas posts in 1987-88 represent approximately 9 months expenditure only. The provision for 1988-89 represents the estimated requirement for a full twelve months expenditure.

      <para>
       (1) The table below shows figures of approved export applications from 1 January 1985 to 6 September 1988. Values are given in `then year' dollars.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Actual exports may differ from the figures of this table because sales can fall through after approvals have been granted. Further, the annual figures are slightly understated as equipment values for some export applications approved were not provided.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) Many of the smaller exports, including, for example, South Africa and Yugoslavia, are of sporting/personal firearms taken out of Australia for personal use and usually brought back to Australia when the owner returns. The South African statistic for 1987 includes the export of a second-hand gelignite wrapping machine worth $90,000 for use in the mining industry.

      <para>
       (1) Officers of the former Department of Trade examined all documents relating to the matters which the honourable member raised in the ajournment debate on 14 May, and prepared a report on them, a copy of which has been lodged with the Parliamentary Library. The conclusions to be drawn from the Department of Trade's report as a whole were that none of the members of the ACTU/TDC mission had acted improperly, but there had been some accounting misunderstandings by the former Department of Trade during the acquittals checking process, and some cases of expenditures having been made outside Commonwealth guidelines. As a result, adjustments were made to the members' acquittals and recovery action for all the amounts involved has been completed.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Department of Trade's finding in relation to Mr Kelty was that he had been underpaid, not overpaid, in relation to his mission expenses.

       (2) Since an investigation has taken place, the question does not arise.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) Transportation for the Mission's work program in Vienna was provided by the hire of two Mercedes 250L (chauffeured) at a cost of $A2,275.26. Prior to the Mission's arrival in Vienna, there were communications between the then Department of Trade and the Embassy in Vienna. On 22 August 1986, the Vienna Post advised that, although a minibus would have been cheaper, such a vehicle would only hold 8 people. This meant that supplementary transport would have been needed to cover Embassy staff escorting the 8 member mission. Funding for hire of cars was authorised by the Department of Trade on 28 August 1986, although a cable from the Mission Manager in Stockholm of the same date acknowledged that a minibus would be more cost effective. Whilst the cars were indisputably more expensive, the Department of Trade made the judgement that cars should be preferred to a minibus, particularly in light of the actual numbers involved (8 Mission members and Embassy Secretary/Interpreter) and having regard to the status of the Mission and its members.

       (1) Yes. I have also seen another article on this matter in The Australian of 29 August 1988.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) The Australian Government provides funding to a wide range of Australian and Philippine non-government organisations through the Australian International Development Assistance Bureau, which has mechanisms in place to assess and monitor carefully all projects funded or assisted by the Government. These mechanisms are kept under close review and, while they are not fool-proof, the Government is confident that they give a fair degree of assurance that funds are being used for stated purposes. At this stage, we have no evidence that Australian Government funds have been diverted to illegal organisations in the Philippines.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government also has no evidence that funds raised by Australian churches and non-Government organisations from community sources have been diverted to illegal organisations. While it is clearly the responsibility of those making the allegations to substantiate them, the possibility of inadvertent diversion taking place in the Philippines cannot be ruled out, and warrants investigation by Australian organisations providing funds for humanitarian and development purposes.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) During Mr Hayden's visit to the Philippines in April, Philippine authorities provided to the Australian Government documents captured from the Communist Party of the Philippines (CPP). The documents mention a number of organisations including some Australian ones, but do not constitute evidence of assistance or funding to the CPP, its military wing, the New People's Army (NPA), or other illegal organisations. I do not propose to comment further on the nature of the documents which remain confidential between the two Governments.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) The Australian Government is naturally concerned by these allegations. When in the Philippines in April, Mr Hayden reaffirmed to Foreign Secretary Manglapus that the Australian Government is opposed to the violent activities pursued by the Communist Party of the Philippines and the New People's Army against the democratically elected Government of the Philippines. At that time, and again at the ASEAN meeting in Bangkok in July, Mr Hayden gave a firm undertaking that if evidence was found of violations of Australian Law, the Government would act promptly to enforce the Law. At the same time, Mr Hayden stressed that enforcement of Philippine Law is clearly a matter for Philippine authorities.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Australian Government is concerned that the allegations could call into question the integrity of Australian church and non-government aid organisations an the valuable social and humanitarian work they carry out in the Philippines and elsewhere. It is against this background that the Government has called on Australian organisations to maintain high standards of accountability. In this context, I welcome the expressed willingness of the bodies concerned to investigate the allegations with a view to ensuring aid funds are not inadvertently misdirected.

       (1) For Government officials proceeding overseas on a long-term mission, a pre-posting medical examination is required.

A Senior Commonwealth Medical Officer will certify whether an officer is or is not fit for service in particular country of posting.

       (3) Dr Jenkins had a preposting medical examination at the Melbourne Commonwealth Medical Office on 4 February 1986, which included reports from his treating specialists. On the basis of these the examining Commonwealth Medical Officer declared him fit for overseas service for a three year posting to Madrid. The Senior Commonwealth Medical Officer, on examination of all the specialist reports and his knowledge of the specific conditions in question, wrote an additional report to the Secretary of the Department confirming there to be some limitation to his physical capabilities to undertake the duties of the overseas position when compared with a person of the same age not suffering from this disorder. A recommendation was then made by the Department to the Minister that the posting should proceed.

       (4) (a) (b). In reaching its decisions on postings to all positions at overseas missions the Department takes into consideration the desired level of language proficiency for individual positions, including those of Head of Mission. Positions at overseas missions are accorded a language designation and the desired level has been established in accordance with the experience of officers who have occupied specific positions in relevant missions. All Head of Mission positions are designated language positions. Where an officer, including the Head of Mission, does not have fluency in the language of the country of posting, the Department arranges tuition to enable the officer to reach the desired level of proficiency to ensure his/her capability to operate effectively in the country of posting. The level of training takes the form of: long term (more than six months) for a high level of proficiency in the more difficult key languages; short term (usually 2 to 4 months)-the main form of Departmental training; additional training at post, often part time.

        —The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) The Australian Embassy in Ethiopia was (a) opened on 10 December 1984 and (b) closed on 2 December 1987.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) The costs of (a) establishing the Embassy were $485,000 and (b) closing the Embassy were nil. As a result of the Embassy closure an amount of $349,000 was received for the sale/transfer of motor vehicles and fittings and the transfer of furniture to other posts.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) (a) The reasons for opening the Embassy derived from the Joint Committee's report on Australia's Representation in Africa (of December 1983) which recommended that Australia open a resident mission in Addis Ababa. The Government then decided that it would be in keeping with Australia's interests in this region, and with our intention to focus Australia's foreign policy role towards the Indian Ocean and East Africa, to establish a small resident mission in Addis Ababa to:
      </para>
      <para>
       Provide Australia with a direct channel of communication with the Ethiopian Government and our first resident diplomatic presence in the Horn of Africa;
      </para>
      <para>
       Manage Australia's large scale emergency food aid program to Ethiopia;
      </para>
      <para>
       Serve as a point of contact with the Organisation of Africa Unity and the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa, both of which have their headquarters in Addis Ababa.
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) The decision to close the Australian Embassy in Addis Ababa was taken with great reluctance and was solely for budgetary reasons. It was necessitated by the extraordinary constraints dictated by the economic situation and reflected the Government's commitment to cutting expenditure.

       (1) The bulk of `other assistance' is channelled through non-government organisations.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) The Government oversees and supervises the work of distributing Australian sourced aid in the following manner:
      </para>
      <para>
       The primary means of oversight for the distribution of Australian sourced aid in Ethiopia is the Australian High Commission in Nairobi which also has administrative responsibility for an AIDAB office in Addis Ababa. During the recent emergency a Nairobi-based aid officer spent 75 percent of her time in Addis Ababa monitoring Australian aid to Ethiopia.
      </para>
      <para>
       With regard to developmental aid the aid officer is in regular contact with the World Food Program, an agent for the large food-for-work program in the Southern Zone, as well as the associated Ethiopian government instrumentalities. Similarly, the aid officer liaises with the World Bank on the Forage Seed Program of the Bank's fourth Livestock Development Project; the program is supported by funds from the sale of Australian wheat.
      </para>
      <para>
       An Australian livestock adviser is also attached to the World Bank's Agricultural Development Service in Ethiopia.
      </para>
      <para>
       The aid officer makes regular field trips to program sites, receives regular program reports and is in frequent contact with the offices in Addis Ababa of the WFP and World Bank as well as Ethiopian Government officials concerning the running of these developmental projects.
      </para>
      <para>
       The emergency component of the 1987-88 program to Ethiopia is controlled through various mechanisms. Australian emergency assistance is monitored by the aid officer in conjunction with the selected implementing agencies.
      </para>
      <para>
       The major part of Australia's emergency aid is channelled through Non-Government Organisations (NGOs) operating in country as well as UN agencies (UNDRO, FAO, and UNICEF). In addition an Australian NGO Consortium monitors the distribution of packages of emergency aid to the rebel controlled areas of Eritrea and Tigray. This NGO Consortium and four other NGOs have also received individual support for emergency assistance under the AIDAB/NGO Co-operation Program.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government of Ethiopia's Relief and Rehabilitation Commission received approximately 12% of Australian emergency assistance to Ethiopia in 1987-88.
      </para>
      <para>
       In all instances organisations are selected on the basis of a proven capacity to operate effectively in the areas where relief is to be provided. Regular reporting by the implementing agencies to AIDAB is standard practice.
      </para>
      <para>
       (6). The problems experienced previously in the provision of Australian aid to Ethiopia and which may continue in the future are port congestion, grain storage limitations and internal distribution. Port congestion and grain storage problems caused by limited capacity to handle the large volumes, can be expected to ease with increased donor coordination on food aid shipments, increased storage capacity, and improved rainfall which is likely to reduce the need for current levels of external food aid.
      </para>
      <para>
       Internal distribution problems relate to both the inadequate supply and maintenance of truck transport (which has improved over recent months), heavy rainfall which can make roads impassable, and access to sensitive areas under dispute between insurgents and the Government of Ethiopia (GOE)
      </para>
      <para>
       With an escalation of the fighting in northern Ethiopia, the GOE ordered the withdrawal of virtually all expatriate aid workers from Eritrea and Tigray. The Australian Government worked in concert with other donors and made representations to the GOE authorities about the problems created by these developments, in particular the impact on monitoring food supplies.
      </para>
      <para>
       As long as insurgencies continue in Ethiopia, it will remain a difficult task to provide relief aid to people in need of emergency assistance and adequate monitoring arrangements to ensure the viability of the assistance provided.

       <para in-line="1">
        —The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) It is fair to say that little progress has been made in the establishment of an Indian Ocean Zone of Peace (IOZOP) since the adoption of Resolution 2832 at the United Nations on 16 December 1971 declaring that Zone, and the establishment in 1972 of an Ad Hoc Committee to consider issues associated with the implementation of that resolution, including the convening of an international conference on the Zone. Differences remain within the Committee, comprising 49 member States (list attached), on the question of the circumstances under which a successful conference could be convened.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) and (4) Members of the Committee stated in their report to the Third Special Session on Disarmament that they remain convinced that concrete action for the achievement of the objectives of the Declaration of the Indian Ocean Zone of Peace would be a substantial contribution to the strengthening of international peace and security as well as the independence, sovereignty, territorial integrity and peaceful development of the States of the region.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Governments of the USA, Pakistan, UK and France are broadly of the view that, if a conference is to be convened on the Indian Ocean Zone of Peace, it must offer some prospect of contributing to the establishment of such a zone. This means, among other things, that it must be adequately prepared; there must be a clear understanding of what it is expected to achieve, including the definition of appropriate commitments and obligations on the part of both the regional States and the extra-regional powers; and it must stand a realistic chance of success. The USSR has urged, most recently in Mr Gorbachev's Krasnoyarsk speech in September 1988, that a conference on the Zone be held not later than 1990. India maintains that the conference should be attended by all States with a direct interest in the issue.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) The only nuclear-powered submarine which is known to be permanently based in the Indian Ocean is the Charlie-class submarine recently leased by India from the Soviet Union. It would not be in Australia's security interests to provide details of transits by any other nuclear-powered submarines through the Indian Ocean. To do so would have the effect of assisting other countries to evaluate the ability of the Australian Government, and the countries with which it shares intelligence information, to monitor the activities of foreign navies.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) The Australian Government has given consistent support to the concept of the IOZOP in line with Labor Party policy and its commitment to peace and disarmament.
      </para>
      <para>
       Australia has played a prominent role in the Ad Hoc Committee of which it was a foundation member and which has met regularly in New York. Australia holds the positions of Vice Chairman of the committee and also that of Western Group Coordinator. Australia has sought to perform a ``bridge-building'' role in the Committee, promoting consensus and, where possible, positive progress towards implementation of the resolution adopted by the General Assembly.
      </para>
      <para>
       Early in its first term, the Government took the view that a conference should be viewed as contributing to the evolution of a suitable political and security environment rather than being dependent on such an environment already being in place. Earlier, Australia had broadly subscribed to the view that a conference would not be appropriate until a conducive political and security climate had emerged in the region. The Government considers that the establishment of an IOZOP requires the full and active participation and cooperation of all permanent members of the Security Council, the major maritime users and littoral and hinterland states.

       In relation to (b), the development of space launching facilities in the Cape York area has been proposed as a privately owned and operated project. The Commonwealth Government fully supports the Queensland Government's efforts to develop a commercial spaceport on Cape York and to ensure that there is full private sector ownership and responsibility for the project. The Commonwealth Government's role is to assist consortia undertaking feasibility studies to address and resolve Commonwealth related issues so that the viability of the spaceport can be determined. The Commonwealth will also facilitate discussions with foreign governments which have a potential interest in the civil use of the proposed project.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government is aware of discussions which have taken place between the USSR space organisation, Glavkosmos, and representatives of Cape York Space Agency Pty Ltd, one of the consortia examining a spaceport at Cape York. Glavkosmos representatives have also visited Canberra to explain their position to officials in Government departments. No negotitions or proposals emerged from these contacts which require examination by the Australian Government.
      </para>
      <para>
       In relation to (d) the Soviet Union space organisation, Glavkosmos, in the course of a conference on ``Commercial Opportunities from Space Transport'' in Brisbane on 28 April 1988, publicly extended an offer to train an Australian to fly on a Soviet spacecraft. The offer was again extended, on a commercial basis, to Departmental officials in Canberra on 2 May, and it was further discussed during the recent visit to the Soviet Union of an Australian delegation under the Australia/USSR Space Research Cooperation Agreement. It is not under any further examination at present.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) There have been discussions between the Governments of Australia and the USSR on fisheries-related questions, such as those which have now been proposed, for approximately a decade (essentially since Australia proclaimed its AFZ in 1979). Indeed, prior to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan, the Australian Government had given its approval to Australian-USSR joint ventures in feasibility fishing. At that time the initiative rested both with the USSR and with Australian companies. Fisheries matters were raised with the Prime Minister during his visit to Moscow in December 1987. On that occasion the Prime Minister undertook to consider any specific proposals submitted by the USSR.
      </para>
      <para>
       The first set of proposals, mentioned above, were made during a visit to Australia in mid-April 1988 by a delegation led by the Soviet First Deputy Minister for Fisheries, Mr N. P. Kudryavtsev.
      </para>
      <para>
       During the visit to Australia in July 1988 by Mr Vladimir Kamentsev, Deputy Chairman of the USSR Council of Ministers, the Australian Government advised the Soviet side that Australia was prepared to enter into negotiations with the Soviet Union on the basis of the Soviet proposals in the context of a broader package of measures involving long term arrangements for commodities. The initial round of negotiations took place in Moscow in September 1988.
      </para>
      <para>
       Proposals in relation to the space activities referred to above have been initiated by commercial interests in Australia and Glavkosmos in the USSR. Any follow-up contacts by Australian Government officials have taken place in the normal course of events.
      </para>
      <para>
       I am unable to respond to the final part of the question regarding the timing for consideration of proposals in the absence of a definition of what is meant by ``such haste''.

      <para>
       (1) The question of ships flying flags of convenience has not been specifically examined in a UN specialised agency. The UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) provided the forum for the negotiation of the UN Convention on Conditions for Registration of Ships. That Convention prescribes minimum acceptable registration standards for ships irrespective of their flag of registration. In the course of its negotiation, registration issues posed by flags of convenience ships were addressed. The Convention was open for signature in New York from 1 May 1986 to 30 April 1987 and remains open for accession but has yet to enter into force. Australia has not acceded to the convention.
      </para>
      <para>
       At times UN specialised agencies have had to take account of the practice of flags of convenience in relation to other issues. The work of the UN Environment Program (UNEP) on transboundary movement of hazardous waste has involved some consideration of the practice of flags of convenience. Similarly, the issue has arisen peripherally in the course of discussions at the ILO's Maritime Conference dealing with working conditions of seafarers.

       (4) Yes. Security clearance requirements for access to the JDFPG secure area contribute to Australia's national security. They are determined in accordance with government policy and are consistent with the Government's view of the value of Australian citizenship. In addition, for a security check to be meaningful the person being cleared must have spent a reasonable period of their lives in circumstances that are checkable. In relation to JDFPG, which is a Joint Australian/US facility, a security clearance is a prerequisite, by international agreement, for all employed within the facility, including staff engaged by private contractors, such as Collins. I might add that provision exists to waive the citizenship requirement should it be considered in the national interest to do so.
