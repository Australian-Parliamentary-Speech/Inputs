                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">The SPEAKER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Time">12:00</span>):  I'm pleased to present the report of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation that participated in the 147th Inter-Parliamentary Union Assembly held in Luanda in Angola from 23 to 27 October 2023. It was a great honour and privilege to lead this delegation. Travelling alongside, as part of the Australian delegation, was Senator the Hon. Linda Reynolds CSC, Senator Deborah O'Neill, the member for Leichhardt, Hon. Warren Entsch, and the member for Bruce, Mr Julian Hill MP. The theme of the assembly was 'Parliamentary action for peace, justice and strong institutions'. The delegation attended the formal sessions and participated in the Governing Council. Australia led meetings of the Asia-Pacific Group, and the delegation also participated in the Twelve Plus geopolitical groups, the Forum of Women Parliamentarians and the various standing committees. We also held multilateral and bilateral meetings with parliamentary delegations from the Pacific Islands, Germany, Japan, Lithuania, Portugal and Ukraine.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">During the assembly, I contributed to the general debate on behalf of the Australian delegation and parliament on the topic of improving the representation of women, youth and minorities in parliament. I drew attention to the Australian parliament's record on gender representation. I also spoke about some of my own initiatives as chair of the Asia-Pacific Group, such as hosting webinars on youth engagement and women's participation. I spoke about Australia's efforts in building trust and confidence in public institutions, including the establishment of the National Anti-Corruption Commission. I also discussed the important work of the Parliamentary Education Office, who I worked with closely on the Parliament in Schools program.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Reynolds contributed during the general debate on human trafficking, especially orphanage trafficking. Australia's draft orphanage trafficking resolution that was put forward in the last assembly was debated in the Forum of Women Parliamentarians. Debate led to agreement on two amendments, which were incorporated into the text. The full assembly later unanimously adopted the resolution, and I thank and congratulate Senator Reynolds for leading this process on behalf of the delegation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In a first in the IPU's history, the assembly was unable to achieve the required two-thirds majority vote on a topic for discussion under the emergency item provisions, meaning that the emergency motion did not proceed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my final meeting as chair of the Asia-Pacific Group, we received briefings from Asia-Pacific Group members of the IPU Executive Committee, considered a report from the ASEAN Plus Three group meeting and endorsed candidates for positions on the IPU committees.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm proud to announce to the parliament that I was elected to the Governing Council to the executive committee by declaration. I will serve a four-year term on the committee—the first time that an Australian has served on this committee for 30 years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also attended a joint meeting of the Chairpersons of Geopolitical Groups and Presidents of Standing Committees, updating them on the activities of the Asia-Pacific Group. Senator O'Neill provided the concluding statement to the plenary on the Asia-Pacific Group, and I thank her for the address.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The outgoing IPU president, Mr Duarte Pacheco, addressed the assembly, discussing matters ranging from the war in Ukraine to the impacts of climate change. The IPU also elected its 131st president, and I congratulate the Hon. Dr Tulia Ackson, Speaker of the National Assembly of Tanzania, on her appointment. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On behalf of the Australian delegation, I would like to thank those who supported the 147th assembly: firstly, the Australian high commissioner, Her Excellency Ms Tegan Brink, and Ms Justine Jones at the Australian High Commission in Pretoria, for their support and guidance; secondly, Mr Warren King, the deputy ambassador to the United Arab Emirates, and Ms Petra Aitken, for their assistance in Dubai; and, thirdly, the staff of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in Canberra who provided background briefing materials, including Ms Sarah Maddison and Ms Victoria Fitzgerald, who coordinated the provision of the materials. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I extend our thanks to the Parliamentary Library, in particular to Mr Jerome Gavin and his colleagues, for providing briefing materials which were extremely helpful and informative. The delegation deeply appreciated the assistance and support of the International Parliamentary Relations Office, particularly Ms Renae Onitiri, for assistance with travel arrangements and predeparture briefings. Finally, the delegation would like to acknowledge and thank Dr Jane Thomson, the delegation secretary, and Ms Elise Williamson from the Department of the Senate. I commend the report to the House.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an absolutely outrageous decision by the Albanese government. There is nothing more important than the online safety of children. This is one of the defining issues of our era. Every single parent in Australia worries about this. It's an immensely significant issue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Back in 2020 the member for Fisher chaired a bipartisan parliamentary inquiry, by members from all parts of this House. One of their key recommendations was to pursue age verification technology to stop children from accessing dangerous content. Our government asked the eSafety Commissioner to investigate this issue. The eSafety Commissioner, the person in this country who has more expertise than anyone else on these matters, spent two years looking into this issue, and in March she presented a report to the government. Her key recommendation was to conduct a trial of age assurance technology to protect children, principally from pornography and other forms of dangerous content, and then mandate and prescribe age assurance technology. That's what the eSafety Commissioner said.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What did this government say to the eSafety Commissioner? 'No, we're not going to do what you, the eSafety Commissioner, want us to do. But do you know what we are going to do? We're going to do what the pornography industry wants us to do.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many things in politics can be explained, but what the Minister for Communications did defies all explanation. Here's what the minister decided to do: not implement the eSafety Commissioner's recommendation. No, don't do that. Instead, leave the matter up to the industry! The industry in this case, of course, is the pornography industry. What an extraordinary thing for the Minister for Communications to do. Immediately, the children's safety and women's safety experts of Australia stood up and condemned this decision by the government. Of course, we're talking about such a serious issue, and the government's own National Plan to End Violence against Women and Children<span style="font-style:italic;"></span>says:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">With pornography now overwhelmingly consumed online and via mobile devices, it is both prevalent and pervasive, perpetuating sexist, misogynistic and degrading views about women. This is a serious concern in addressing the drivers of violence against women and children.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's absolutely right. That's a reason why this is such an urgent issue that must be debated by the House.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">An activist group called Collective Shout organised 49 advocates and experts in children's safety and women's safety to say what they thought about this issue. Here's what they said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Who signed that letter? Forty-nine experts. One of them was Robert Fitzgerald. You know who he is? He was the former royal commissioner into child sexual abuse. He signed that letter, as did the author Maggie Dent; Chanel Contos of Teach Us Consent, who does such tremendous work in this area; Alison Geale, the CEO of Bravehearts; the Daniel Morcombe Foundation; author Steve Biddulph, an expert in this area; Professor Clive Hamilton; Grace Tame of the Grace Tame Foundation; and Anna Bowden, the CEO of the International Centre for Missing and Exploited Children Australia. They all signed this letter, saying:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's what they said.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And you know who else had something to say about it? Anne Hollonds. Anne Hollonds is the National Children's Commissioner. Her job is to stand up for the rights of children, to look after the welfare of children and to basically speak up for kids, who often can't speak up for themselves. Anne Hollonds, the National Children's Commissioner, said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">If child wellbeing was a national priority, we would act on e-Safety's plan to trial ways to protect young kids from online porn. This would help to reduce child sex abuse, youth crime, domestic and family violence.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">But you know who did actually welcome it? The Eros Association, who speaks for the pornography industry. Graeme Dunne from the Eros Association, on the day the minister announced this decision, appeared on the ABC and said, 'We've always advocated for a sensible approach, and that includes what the government is recommending today.' That's what the Eros Association said. So 49 of the most eminent people in Australia—if you were to define 'eminent', do you get any more eminent than the royal commissioner into child sexual abuse? It's extraordinary. Forty-nine of the most eminent experts in Australia—people who are passionate about protecting our children and passionate about issues relating to women's safety—condemn it. The Eros Association says it's good. This is the situation we are in under this extraordinary Minister for Communications.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But it's not only about the Minister for Communications, because there is a very obvious question that springs to mind: what is the Prime Minister doing about this? Is he backing the Minister for Communications on this, against the advice of Australia's top experts? What on earth is going on? There are basically two scenarios here. One is that the Prime Minister doesn't know what's going on and what his minister is doing—</span>

                  </a>  which is very, very damning. The other is that he does know that the minister has decided to ignore the eSafety Commissioner, and he supports it. After all, he is leading the government. That's why it is important for prime ministers to be across the detail—and this is an awful, awful detail, what the government has done here.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are good people in this parliament. I think everyone in this parliament wants to do the right thing on these issues. I know that, when the member for Fisher chaired this inquiry, there were people from all parts of this chamber who backed this 100 per cent. We want a vote on this, because we want everyone to stand with the eSafety Commissioner on this issue, stand against the pornography industry, back this incredibly sensible recommendation and get on with protecting Australian kids.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr WALLACE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fisher</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:16</span>):  I second the motion. When I was the Chair of the Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs, we undertook this inquiry with the support of my coalition colleagues and, indeed, even with the support of those members opposite. The report that was handed down in February 2020 was called <span style="font-style:italic;">Protecting the age of innocence</span>. Do you know who gave the report that title? It was the member for Macarthur. The member for Macarthur is a great Australian, a longstanding paediatrician who cares deeply about the welfare of children—I do not doubt that for a second. But those members opposite will need to make a call today about whether they support this Minister for Communications and, indeed, the Prime Minister or whether they support doing what is right, because what is right is to introduce a trial that will provide age verification for online pornography.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Young people under the age of 18 can't go into a newsagent and buy pornography. The laws of this country say you need to be over 18. All we are saying—all we have said for many years—is that the online world should shape and reflect what happens in the real world. You can't get access legally to pornography if you are under 18—and for very good reason. And yet on the internet young people are accessing pornography, and we're not just talking about <span style="font-style:italic;">Playboy </span>or <span style="font-style:italic;">Penthouse </span>or that sort of soft porn; we are talking about hardcore, violent, extremist, degrading behaviour against women.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those members opposite talk the big talk—and they did it yesterday—about protecting women. There is absolutely no doubt that there is a direct correlation between hardcore pornography and domestic violence. Those members opposite would have to acknowledge that. This is a watershed moment for these members in this chamber. Do you support what is right? Do you support women? Do you support standing against domestic violence? If you do, when this comes to a vote you will support the position of the opposition on this. There is nowhere to move. Look at all of the challenges that our young people are experiencing right now and think about all the parents, teachers and principals who have spoken to us in our time as MPs. One of the main things they talk to us about is access to pornography on these things. All they have to do is tick a box to say they are 18 or over. That is entirely insufficient. There is absolutely no doubt that the Eros Foundation supported the views of the minister in not undertaking this trial. It is no wonder that the Eros Foundation supported self-regulation; that is like putting Dracula in charge of the blood bank.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Big porn do not care about Australians. They do not care about young Australians. Big porn are concerned about one thing and one thing only, and that is profit. Unfortunately, for reasons which escape me, this minister is giving them free rein. If anybody can explain and justify the decision of this government, I am all ears. If anybody can explain to me why the Prime Minister would sit back and allow this decision to go unchallenged, I am, once again, all ears.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the other challenges we talk about with young people is the falling education standards. We heard in the committee, time and time again, from parents telling us that their kids were sitting up late at night under the doona watching porn on their phones, then going to school the next day exhausted. Is it any wonder that our education standards are dropping in this country? This is a huge problem, and this communications minister needs to step up and do something about it.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mayo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:21</span>):  Some months ago, I had a couple come in and see me. They had four beautiful children, and their youngest son had taken his life. I say this to the parliament knowing that the parents have given me their permission to do so. According to what he'd said to his mum, he took his life because he'd seen things he never should have seen. He was not yet 18. He had his whole life in front of him. He was so disturbed by what he saw that he could see no way out of it. There'll be a hole in that family this Christmas, next Christmas and every birthday. Those parents want to do everything that they can to raise awareness about this and about how pornography, in particular, damages young minds. It rewires people's minds.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yesterday we had some motions about violence against women. We know, with respect to pornography, that violence against women is portrayed as entertainment. We know that many, many children, before they turn of age, have seen many, many images that are violent and pornographic. We have a responsibility in this place to ensure that we do everything we can, legislatively, to protect children and protect their rights to be children.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am supporting the motion to suspend standing orders because this is an incredibly urgent matter. It is a matter that is affecting so many families in my community and, I can only assume, in the communities of every other member in this chamber. We need leadership and courage from government and from everyone in this place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was the most harrowing meeting with that family. What do you say to a mother who has buried her child? No parent should have to do that. So I would urge the government to look at this motion for the suspension of standing orders. Let us all work together on matters like this and see this as a matter of urgency for the parliament to act.</span>

This is a critical issue for the community, for women and for parents. I think there's a huge level of support from many in our community who feel this is an urgent issue to discuss. I look forward to hearing what the minister has to say on this. The evidence is clear that porn harms. Porn exposure harms developing sexual templates. There are recommendations from the eSafety Commissioner and many others in support of this. I think it is absolutely urgent that we discuss this today.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bradfield</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Manager of Opposition Business</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:25</span>):  This matter is urgent for the very good reasons that the member for Banks and the member for Fisher have articulated. One of the reasons it's urgent is that the government has before it a template with which to act. This is not a policy approach which is being suggested in a rushed or a slapdash way. In fact, there has been very thorough public policy work done, thanks to the process initiated by the member for Fisher. The eSafety Commissioner—established by the coalition and doing extraordinarily important work—was charged with examining this issue, which is extremely pressing, as the members for Mayo and Wentworth have rightly pointed out. This is an enormously pressing and problematic issue. There is a template in front of us, developed by the eSafety Commissioner after detailed work. What this motion is calling for is that, as a matter of urgency, this parliament should move to essentially reverse the ill-judged approach that the minister has taken. In the interest of allowing the minister some time to explain her position to the parliament, I'll conclude there. </span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms ROWLAND</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Greenway</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Communications</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:26</span>):  I appreciate the opportunity to speak on this very important issue. I do note the contribution from the member for Mayo, which is heartfelt and sincere. We do have an obligation to do everything we can to keep our most vulnerable safe. I'm sure the member would never have expected that in her role as MP that she would be in that position.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">No Australian wants children accessing pornographic material online, full stop. Governments around the world are grappling with this and the challenge is significant. However, Australia is steps ahead with the legislative framework and the powers of the eSafety Commissioner, established under the Online Safety Act. In opposition, we supported recommendations for eSafety to develop the road map for age verification, which was released in August. I thank eSafety for that very important work. The road map made a number of recommendations, including that the government invest in research, education and resources, that eSafety continue to work to implement the Online Safety Act, and that age assurance technologies be piloted in Australia before we seek to mandate them. I note the pilot remains in consideration by government, as we have stated, since August. We will seek further options on a pilot, and my department will be involved in scoping this work, given the need for cross-portfolio engagement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is indeed, as the member for Wentworth said, a time when we should be working together, because the road map outlined work that is already underway to implement the Online Safety Act, including the development of enforceable industry codes to deal with children's access to online pornography. These are actually the most effective tools we have right now to effect comprehensive change across the whole digital ecosystem in the near term, which is why I want to see them prioritised.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I do want to explain why the codes process, overseen by the independent regulator, eSafety, is the most effective lever available to deliver improved protections for children and why I want to see it prioritised. The new codes will apply to critical parts of the digital industry, including pornography websites and the many other locations where children find pornography—concerningly, including social media, where they inadvertently find it. This is unacceptable and cannot continue. The codes will also cover parts of the digital ecosystem that can prevent children arriving at risky sites, such as devices, search engines and app stores. I point out that this process was recently used to establish codes in relation to illegal class 1 content—that is, such as child sexual abuse material and pro-terror content on digital platforms.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In August I wrote to eSafety asking that work commence on the codes to specifically address online pornography as soon as practicable. If the codes don't provide appropriate safeguards, the commissioner can reject them and move to enforceable standards, just as she has done recently for two mandatory standards in relation to class 1 illegal content.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to make it clear that, contrary to what some of those opposite have said, the regulator does not allow the industry to mark its own homework when it comes to pornography. Industry will face penalties for noncompliance once the rules are in place, and any suggestion otherwise is a misreading of the act.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Some age assurance technologies are already being deployed effectively to prevent a range of harms to children, and that technology is advancing. That's why I have announced that we will strengthen the government's basic online safety expectations with a new expectation of industry to show how they support the best interests of children in the design of their products and to make it explicit that age assurance technologies are an important tool.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I end by stressing for the benefit of all in this place that the pilot remains in consideration by the government, as we've said since August. We will seek further options on a pilot, and my department will be involved in scoping this work, given the need for cross-portfolio engagement. It is important that we implement as soon as possible—which is exactly what I've asked eSafety to do—the process under law passed by those opposite, which we supported, which is already proving effective in making sure we don't have that class 1 pro-terror, child sexual abuse and child sexual exploitation material out there. This is being used effectively, and I call on the parliament to work together to support eSafety in this important work.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="L6B" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr FLETCHER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bradfield</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Manager of Opposition Business</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:32</span>):  I rise to speak on the Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment (Prohibited Hate Symbols and Other Measures) Bill 2023. I say upfront that the coalition supports the key measures in this bill. The most important parts of this bill prohibit the public display of some of the most powerful symbols of antisemitism our world has ever seen. Those parts of the bill prohibit the display of the Nazi swastika and the double-sig rune, which represent the most potent and violent forms of antisemitism. They are associated with the murder of over six million Jews and millions of others in concentration camps during the Second World War. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an issue which should unite this place. There is no place in our civil society for symbols which are directly linked to one of the most hateful regimes in history. A million Australians served in the fight against the Nazis' race-based ideologies and those of their allies throughout the Second World War, and 39,600 Australians paid the supreme sacrifice. The public display of Nazi symbols dishonours their memory and diminishes every Australian.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Nazi Germany, under Adolf Hitler, carried out the deliberate, calculated and organised mass murder of six million European Jews, as well as five million prisoners of war and other victims. The Nazis' systematic and state sponsored campaign of persecution dehumanised an entire people. But it was much worse than that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Nazi regime's industrialised extermination resulted in the Holocaust, one of the worst crimes committed in history, and the Nazi regime is one of the greatest evils ever visited on humanity. Because of what they represent—this evil, this terror—Nazi symbols are no ordinary symbols. The public display of Nazi symbols is abhorrent to the Australian way of life and has no part in our political discourse. We must condemn Nazi symbols in any form that they are found or are displayed. All Australians are diminished when there is the sharing and glorification of an ideology which is characterised by genocide, mass murder and other forms of persecution.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians are entitled to take pride in the fact that this nation, together with allied nations from around the globe, fought against the Nazi threat and prevailed in the Second World War. Prohibiting the display of Nazi symbols aligns with our nation's values and our heritage as Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is deeply troubling that we have seen recently a disturbing growth in the glorification of Nazism in Australia. That, of course, is associated with ideologies all too often which present a risk to our security and our way of life. The Director-General of Security has spoken about the growth of grievance-motivated violent extremism. He had this to say:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">As a nation we need to reflect on why some teenagers are hanging Nazi flags and portraits of the Christchurch killer on their bedroom walls and others are sharing beheading videos. Just as importantly, we must reflect on what we can do about it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The display of Nazi symbols is closely associated with extremist groups which may pose a national security risk to Australia. The public display of Nazi symbols is also associated with incitement to violence and with protest action that presents a highly visible threat to public order. For these reasons, amongst others, on this side of the chamber we say that the prohibitions on the public display of the Nazi swastika are justified, proportionate and reasonable. These are not symbols associated with processes of debate and persuasion or with the exchange of ideas; they are symbols of fear and intimidation. They impede the ordinary civil discourse that is the life blood of our democracy, and the prohibition on their public display is a small but important step that is long overdue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is presently seeing the biggest increase in antisemitism since the Second World War. To borrow some words from my friend and colleague the member for Berowra:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Anti-Semitism is not a new thing. It is a hatred that has endured throughout human history. It robs Jewish people of their God-given individuality. It attributes to Jews a set of common negative characteristics: a selfish, greedy, controlling, privileged people that deserves to be attacked. This old hatred morphs with every generation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have seen, following the horrific attacks on Israel on 7 October, that there has been a deeply troubling resurgence in antisemitism in Australia. Just today, newspapers across the country contain announcements in which hundreds and hundreds of high-profile Australians from all walks of life have put their names to a plea for unity and have expressed their grave concern at a 482 per cent rise in antisemitic incidents over the past seven weeks.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are in the appalling situation in modern Australia in which Jewish families are being advised not to advertise their Jewish identity. In the wake of the Hamas atrocities, the Australian Jewish community was unable to gather at the Sydney Opera House when that had been lit up in blue and white—the colours of the Israeli flag—as a sign of support for the Australian Jewish community. Instead, the Jewish community was told by the New South Wales police minister to stay at home. Jewish people in Australia today are worried about their children wearing the school uniform of a Jewish school when they're out and about in public. They are worried about doing their food shopping at their local Jewish supermarket. Jewish people are worried about being targeted for practising their faith in a synagogue. There have been reports that Jewish students are avoiding university campuses out of fear and concern for their safety as a result of anti-Israel slogans and material being broadcasted and distributed at a range of campuses across the country. It is deeply concerning and disheartening to hear that Jewish students feel threatened by other students celebrating the atrocious terrorist attacks carried out by Hamas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">According to the Executive Council of Australian Jewry, there were 368 anti-Jewish incidents reported in Australia between 8 October and 19 November. This compares to a total of 478 antisemitic incidents for the entire year October 2021 to October 2022.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians are aghast. The old hatreds have morphed. Antisemitic sentiment today hides behind labels like 'anti-Israel' and 'anti-Zionist'. These sentiments have been taken on by different groups, by extremists and radicals and, sadly, deeply regrettably, even by some in this parliament, who are, it would seem, happy to be associated with calls for the destruction of the Jewish state. These are new standard bearers, but these new standard bearers are spreading the same old antisemitic hatreds and, all too often, using the same old antisemitic symbols.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are seeing protests, gatherings and demonstrations by Hamas sympathisers where the images and symbols of the Nazi party are now being invoked against Israel. We saw extraordinary and deeply troubling scenes in which crowds in front of Australia's most famous landmark were chanting, 'Gas the Jews,' and worse. They are, in doing that, both at that event and others, invoking the Holocaust in support of Hamas, a collection of murderous terrorist thugs, rightly listed as a terrorist entity under Australian law. It is our responsibility in this parliament to do all that we can to halt the spread of this virulent antisemitic hatred, and the place to start is with the most potent antisemitic symbols, the symbols of the Nazi party.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I said before that this bill is long overdue. It has taken too long to get here and it falls short. It has taken too long because we as a parliament had the opportunity to address the proliferation of antisemitic symbols back in March of this year. The Leader of the Opposition has been at the very forefront of this effort. Together with the member for Berowra, he asked the House to move urgently to ban the symbols of the Nazi regime, to send a clear message that imagery which glorifies antisemitism and violence against Jews is never to be tolerated. Senator Cash did the same in the other place. The coalition put legislation before both chambers. It was legislation based on existing models which have been proven to be effective.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But in March of this year the Labor Party used its numbers in the House of Representatives to cause the House to decline to consider that legislation. In the Senate, Labor senators took the extraordinary step of calling for the coalition's legislation not to be passed. Senator Green, on behalf of Labor senators, called for the Australian parliament not to pass legislation prohibiting the display of Nazi symbols because that legislation had been drafted by the coalition. It seems that the motivation was that they wanted it to be a government bill instead. You could not find a more troubling example of putting political imperatives, objectives and expediency above serving the people of Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Instead of the parliament acting decisively on this issue eight months ago, the current Albanese Labor government decided to let the situation fester, and now Australia is in the intolerable situation in which we are seeing ever-rising incidences of antisemitism. This bill has taken too long and it falls short.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I observed before that the bill, as drafted by the government, prohibits some of the most powerful symbols of the Nazi Party but, for some baffling reason, does not deal with the Nazi salute. The salute is as intrinsic to the Nazi Party as the swastika. It is as well-known a symbol of the Nazi Party as the swastika. The salute is a gesture which glorifies antisemitic hatred and celebrates the murder of Jewish people. Yet, for some baffling reason, some inexplicable reason, some indefensible and unjustifiable reason, on three occasions now the Albanese Labor government has refused to deal with it. In March the government first declined to consider the coalition's legislation. In May the government referred to vague constitutional concerns, the case for which has subsequently entirely failed to be made out, and again objected to coalition legislation. On the third occasion, in November, the government refused to deal with this matter when Labor members on the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security said the prohibition of the Nazi salute would 'not be appropriate as a federal offence'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an approach which is simply cowardly. It represents a desire stated by government members to abrogate their leadership responsibilities, the responsibilities that fall naturally and appropriately to our national government, and instead to leave this matter to be dealt with by state governments. That is not an approach the coalition supports and is not an approach the coalition thinks is justifiable in any way. That is why the coalition will move amendments to improve this bill. The effect of those amendments will be to prohibit the public display of the Nazi salute in the same way this bill prohibits the public display of the Nazi swastika and the Nazi double sig rune. I hope the government will see sense and join us in this very important step in the fight against antisemitism.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I should acknowledge that there are other parts of this legislation. Other parts of schedule 1 prohibit the display of the Islamic State flag. Schedule 2 creates new offences prohibiting the use of a carriage service for violent extremist material. Schedule 3 strengthens offences around advocating terrorism and strengthens the associated penalties. Schedule 4 deals with the listing of terrorist organisations. The Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security has made recommendations in relation to these parts of the bill, and we look forward to seeing the government's response in due course.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the meantime, I ask that every parliamentarian examining this legislation, in considering how he or she will vote, consider very carefully the amendments the coalition will bring forward and, in turn, support us in the essential fight against antisemitism.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="L6B" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr FLETCHER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bradfield</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Manager of Opposition Business</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:48</span>):  I rise to speak on the Australian Human Rights Commission Amendment (Costs Protection) Bill 2023. It is appropriate to start by reflecting on the genesis of this bill and the objectives it should be setting out to achieve. This is a bill that should be implementing recommendation 25 of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Respect@Work</span> report. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Respect@Work</span> report made 55 recommendations across a range of areas, the bulk of which have now become law with coalition support. Recommendation 25 came in the context of the discussion about barriers and disincentives to pursuing sexual harassment matters in federal jurisdiction. It is found in section 5.4 of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Respect@Work</span> report, which is described as examining 'the Sex Discrimination Act and state and territory anti-discrimination laws'. The discussion in the report is short but clear and deals with a few key points.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's worth reflecting on those points, which should be guiding our discussion today. First, the Commissioner noted submissions recommending a costs protection provision in the Australian Human Rights Commission Act, which would:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… provide that applicants and respondents should bear their own costs unless an exception applies—if the court is satisfied that the party instituted proceedings vexatiously or without reasonable cause.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Second, the report cited submissions to the effect that the general rule that costs follow the event:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… operates as a disincentive to pursuing sexual harassment matters under the Sex Discrimination Act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Third, in response to those submissions, the Commissioner acknowledged:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… the risk of a costs order acts as a disincentive to pursuing sexual harassment matters in the federal jurisdiction.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The report specifically recommended a new provision along the lines of section 570 of the Fair Work Act, which establishes a cost-neutrality model. Critically, it noted the intended effect of such a provision was:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Such a provision should ensure costs may only be ordered against a party by the court if satisfied that the party instituted the proceedings vexatiously or without reasonable cause, or if the court is satisfied that a party's unreasonable act or omission caused the other party to incur costs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In other words, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Respect@Work</span> report specifically proposed the hard-costs neutrality model in the Fair Work Act. The discussion in the report specifically and expressly made clear that the provision was about limiting the circumstances in which a complainant can be made to pay costs. It establishes a default position that each party bears their own costs except where they act vexatiously or unreasonably. It is protective.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill takes a very different approach to what was recommended in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Respect@Work</span> report. This bill does not implement a regime that is directed only towards harassment and discrimination claims under the Sex Discrimination Act. The bill would apply to all discrimination matters under federal law and not solely matters under the Sex Discrimination Act. In due course, it would apply to religious institutions and schools if this parliament sees fit to pass a religious discrimination bill. This bill does not implement a provision modelled on section 570 of the Fair Work Act. Instead, the bill implements what the government has called a 'modified equal access model', and the words 'equal access' are also in quotation marks in the government's own materials.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The truth is that there is nothing equal about it. The truth is that the provisions of this bill are not protective. They do not remove barriers in a way that preserves the integrity of litigation and the discretion of the courts. Instead, they are designed to achieve the objective that, in court, the balance is tilted in favour of complainants regardless of the nature of complaint or the conduct of proceedings.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill takes an extraordinary approach that goes further than any other Australian jurisdiction and any other comparable nation. It is appropriate to run through how this bill will work in practice. For simplicity and clarity, I will refer to the person commencing the litigation as 'the complainant'. The courts at present make costs orders to reflect on the conduct of the proceedings, the merits of the parties' positions and the ultimate outcome. The courts at present, therefore, make costs orders that best give effect to justice in the case. We know that our judges do not take that responsibility lightly. But this bill takes that discretion away from them. Instead, this bill says that the court must award costs to a complainant if they are successful on one or more grounds. This rule applies in all cases except in relation to costs incurred as a result of a complainant's unreasonable act or omission. It also says that the court must not award costs against the complainant unless some very narrow exceptions are met.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What are those exceptions? Well, the court is permitted to exercise a discretion to award costs to a respondent—that's to say against a complainant—only where the complainant instituted the proceedings vexatiously or without reasonable cause or the complainant's unreasonable acts or omissions caused the respondent to incur costs or the respondent is successful in the proceedings, does not have a 'significant power advantage' and does not have 'significant financial or other resources' relative to the complainant. Crucially, the bill would apply to class-action proceedings and actions brought by trade unions. And, extraordinarily, the drafting of the provisions leaves open the very real possibility that the respondent must pay the costs incurred by the complainant even in respect of grounds that were unsuccessful.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What does this mean in practice? In short, the bill incentivises litigation and disincentivises negotiated outcomes. It removes all real risks from the complainant, provided only that they avoid being found to act unreasonably—and that is not a very difficult thing to achieve. This bill even removes the provision that expressly allows the court to take into account offers to settle. This is an unprecedented change to the dynamics of settlement negotiations. At present, if a person rejects a settlement offer they may have their costs reduced if they're successful in the court case but the court determines that they rejected a reasonable offer. Alternatively, at present a litigant may be ordered to pay additional costs if they reject a reasonable offer and subsequently lose.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill removes the provision that gives the courts the discretion to take these matters into account. It sends a clear message that a complainant who rejects a reasonable settlement offer should not be at risk of an adverse court costs order. Further, the bill leaves open the possibility that the respondent must pay even in respect of grounds that are unsuccessful, because they are all part of the same proceeding. This may very well incentivise plaintiffs to include speculative and low-prospect claims in their statement of claim, driving up costs for respondents. To the contrary, a plaintiff who pursues a claim that has low prospects may do so knowing that the worst outcome they'll face is having to pay their own costs and that if they're successful on any ground they will be awarded costs. There is no downside, under the regime that this bill establishes, to pressing ahead with a low-prospect claim. Crucially, this can be exploited in class actions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is a litigation funder's dream. It is a class-action lawyer's meal ticket. It is a trade union's golden pathway. You need only look at the number of Labor parliamentarians who started their careers with class-action law firms and at the scale of the donations provided to the Labor Party by class-action law firms, and of course by trade unions, to gain an insight into the government's motivation as to introducing these extraordinary provisions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The effect of these provisions is that all you need to do is drum up a low-value or speculative complaint and then resist all attempts at conciliation in the Australian Human Rights Commission. Then, once you're in the courts, you simply press ahead with your ambit, low-value and speculative claim. Then, so long as you're not unreasonable or vexatious, you can slowly lead the respondent through costs that they will be forced to bear as you drag out the litigation, knowing it is unlikely there will be any consequences for rejecting settlement offer after settlement offer. Ultimately, if you make 20 claims and then succeed on one, the bill leaves open the possibility that the respondent will be forced to pay for all of them, and, at worst, so long as you're not unreasonable, you just walk away bearing your own costs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, there's nothing in this bill to prevent these types of actions being brought collaterally to support whatever other objectives the trade union or class-action law firm is trying to pursue on a particular day. It is not appropriate in this chamber to speculate on motives. It's enough to say that it's for the Attorney-General and for the Australian Labor Party to explain what impact this bill will have on the hundreds of businesses and organisations who are now plainly in the sights of activist lawyers. It's for the Attorney-General and Labor Party to explain why they've made such a mockery of the recommendations in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Respect@Work</span> report. It's for the Attorney-General and the Labor Party to explain why the approach to costs in this bill goes further than that of any of the states and territories and any international peer jurisdictions, as set out in the materials prepared by the Attorney-General's own department. It's for the Attorney-General and the Labor Party to explain why it was considered appropriate by this Attorney-General to go further in relation to this remarkable cost regime than even the human rights advocate lawyers that his department commissioned to conduct research on the issue were calling for.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But we can in this place reflect on what this bill should have been. It should have been a bill that implemented recommendation 25 of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Respect@Work</span> report. It should have been a bill that had support across the chamber. It should have been a bill creating a simple cost-neutral jurisdiction in our federal courts to remove barriers to people, primarily women, wishing to pursue complaints about harassment and discrimination. Instead, we have a model which goes further than that of any comparable jurisdiction. The overreach is inexplicable. The bill needs to be carefully scrutinised. A better way forward should be found. This is not a bill and set of provisions that the coalition could support in its current form. I thank the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr FLETCHER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bradfield</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Manager of Opposition Business</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:03</span>):  I rise to speak on the Attorney-General's Portfolio Miscellaneous Measures Bill 2023. Typically, these kinds of omnibus bills are used by a government to bring forward a series of procedural or other minor changes that tidy up issues or implement new measures that are sensible and widely supported. In the main, that is what the Attorney-General has done in this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 1 of the bill confers jurisdiction on the Federal Court to hear and determine a range of criminal offences relating to conduct within the remit of the Australian Securities and Investment Commission. This schedule would allow corporate offences against the ASIC Act, the National Consumer Credit Protection Act and the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act to be determined in the Federal Court. It would mean that the court could hear proceedings for indictable offences, such as: intentionally or recklessly failing to comply with the requirements given by ASIC; contravention of duties and obligations under the Corporations Act, including by directors, officers, employees, auditors, members and licensees; obstructing an audit under the NCCP Act; and knowingly acting as trustee, investment manager or custodian or as a responsible officer of a body corporate which is fulfilling one of these roles or of a superannuation entity while disqualified, contrary to the SIS Act. Importantly, the bill does not substantively change the underlying offence provisions. Rather, it allows them to be heard in Commonwealth courts as well as state and territory courts, which is intended to reduce delays in prosecuting corporate offences. This schedule is consistent with the policy position of the coalition following the banking royal commission.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 2 helps streamline the way juries are appointed in the Federal Court. The Sheriff of the Federal Court will be able either to request a state or territory jury official to prepare and provide a jury panel, with the consent of the relevant state or territory, or to prepare a jury panel directly. This is a sensible measure which is not controversial. It allows the court to take the appropriate approach on a case-by-case basis.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 3 makes changes to the way the marriage celebrants register is administered. The Marriage Act includes longstanding provisions which set out a statutory basis for the Commonwealth Marriage Celebrants Program. All celebrants must be listed on the register to be empowered to solemnise marriages in Australia. The schedule makes some changes relating to the administration of that register and some related matters. It establishes the position of Deputy Registrar of Marriage Celebrants, and the occupant of that position would assist the registrar in maintaining the marriage celebrants register. It amends time frames for a celebrant to be registered and changes the paperwork and notice requirements for a marriage to go ahead. It allows for refunds of marriage celebrant fees, and it stipulates that a celebrant must be physically present at a marriage. These changes are machinery in nature and are supported by the coalition.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is schedule 4 of this bill, entitled 'Other amendments', with which the coalition has a very serious problem. This schedule deals with the Native Title Respondents Scheme. The Native Title Respondents Scheme is a program which provides financial support to pastoralists and other landowners to respond to native title claims. This was an important scheme established by the Howard government. What the scheme did was to ensure that both the claimant and the respondent to a native title claim had fair and equal access to assistance and legal representation. As the National Farmers Federation has said, the scheme is 'essential for the timely and efficient settlement of claims—of great benefit to all parties'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that this government and the Australian Labor Party have long fought against the scheme. The government defunded the scheme when it came to office. The provisions in this bill would now remove the legislative basis for the scheme. This is a totally unnecessary measure which, if passed, would mean that a future parliament would need to legislate to re-establish the scheme. This government and the Australian Labor Party have an ideological objection to this scheme and want to see it eradicated forever. On this side of the House, the Liberal and National parties understand that rural landowners, farmers, pastoralists and graziers are the backbone of this nation. We are talking about the people who feed this nation. On this side of the House, we will always stand up for those people, and it is simply appalling that the government and the Australian Labor Party will not do that. On this side of the House, we know, including through the lived experience of many members in this chamber—including, I might say, the member for Hume, the member for Braddon and many others on this side of the chamber—that it's tough to be a successful farmer in our nation, this remarkable land we call Australia. Farmers endure droughts, floods, fires, and all sorts of challenges that those of us living and working in the cities have very little knowledge of and give very little thought to as we sip our lattes at our local cafes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why such a useful and simple mechanism as this scheme has been ripped away from farmers is beyond comprehension, and to use this bill to extinguish the scheme completely is nothing short of mean-spirited. This scheme has delivered increased understanding of native title issues by peak bodies; coordination instructions to legal representatives; and the grouping of respondents in claim areas. The scheme has operated efficiently. The grouping of native title respondents in claim areas assisted with efficient and cost-effective resolutions of claims, as parties with similar interests were represented by one lawyer and supported by a native title officer. The operation of the scheme has provided a single point of contact for native title claims affecting pastoral respondents. Those respondents were able to work with legal representation to ensure they received relevant and timely information regarding native title processes. Ultimately this gave parties to native title claims timely and relevant access to information on those claims and allowed for informed decisions to be made. The single point of contact and coordination of legal support meant that legal costs could be substantially reduced and proceedings could be significantly streamlined, rather than having many different lawyers and other parties involved. The scheme, therefore, was able to reduce complexity and the potential delays driven by that complexity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The experience of those involved in the scheme over many years has been that it led to a more effective resolution of disputed matters, and this was done in a way that benefited all parties, including the claimants themselves. So, in ending the funding of this scheme, the government has taken away what has been a fundamental deliverer of equity across those participating in what is a complex and contested process. The native title process is complex, it is contested and it requires expert legal capability to be able to navigate it. Individual farmers and even their representative bodies, such as the National Farmers Federation, do not have the skills or the resources at their disposal to adequately engage in the process. It is a cost to doing business that the farmers of this nation should not have to take on. I say, therefore, to the House that the coalition will move an amendment opposing the repeal of the legislative framework underpinning this important scheme when this bill reaches the Senate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to changes to the Native Title Act, schedule 4 of the bill also deals with the appointment of arbitrators in family law matters. Currently, arbitrators in family law matters can refer questions of law to division 2 of the Federal Circuit and Family Court—that's to say the old Federal Circuit Court. The bill would allow arbitrators to also refer such questions to division 1—that's to say the old Family Court of Australia. In effect, these provisions will allow arbitrators to prioritise the former Family Court of Australia when referring questions of law that arise in the context of a family law arbitration. The coalition has questions about the impact this will have on the court's workload and the cost and time implications for parties. We believe the effects of this measure should be examined through a committee process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said at the outset, the majority of this miscellaneous measures bill was straightforward and makes sensible changes that, on this side of the House, we are happy to support. But we cannot support the bill in its current form so long as it includes the present schedule in relation to the Native Title Respondents Scheme.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr TAYLOR</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hume</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:14</span>):  I rise to speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Tax Accountability and Fairness) Bill 2023. This is the 15th tax bill from a government that promised the Australian people it wouldn't raise taxes. It is their 15th tax bill, and they said they wouldn't raise taxes. What we see in this legislation is a case study in the way this government works—the lack of seriousness of this government for acting in the interests of the Australian people rather than acting in its own political self-interest.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As far back as May the government announced their changes to the petroleum resource rent tax, the PRRT. Almost seven months have elapsed since the government announced the policy. Have we seen the bill? No. Have we received answers to the most basic of questions? No. Has the government engaged seriously with the coalition—or any other party, for that matter—to progress this legislation? No.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we see today is a silly stunt from a Treasurer who is out of his depth and out of touch. By attaching the $2.6 billion gas tax to measures responding to the PwC issues and the Tax Practitioners Board, the Treasurer has demonstrated that he is more focused on politics than on outcomes. And why would we be surprised? He's not a doctor of economics—he likes to call himself Dr Chalmers—but a doctor of spin, a doctor of politics. That is what he spends his days doing, and that's exactly what he's done with this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Tacking these PRRT reforms, which he can't answer the most basic question about, to a completely different set of issues is absolutely heinous. As I said, it's the sort of thing we're coming to expect from the government. But there are many basic questions on the PRRT reforms that haven't been answered. What's the level of new revenues raised by this tax? What's the impact on industry and on investment? What's the medium-term cost of the measures? These are all sensible questions, all raised by the opposition, all unanswered, months after first being raised and despite being put to officials at Senate estimates. Tacking this onto measures responding to the revelations this year about the Tax Practitioners Board and PwC is cynical in the extreme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Attaching those two things together shows a level of cynicism that I suppose we're starting to get used to from this government. It makes a joke of the genuine cross-party engagement on this issue that we have attempted to exercise for some months. It makes a joke of the work of Senators Colbeck, Pocock and O'Neill through the Senate Finance and Public Administration Committee. And it shows how contemptuously this government views a rare matter of potential cross-party agreement, and we won't fall for it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our message to the government is clear and it's simple. Pull the PRRT schedule from this bill and start again. Engage with the coalition in good faith on this measure to support the future of our gas industry, to bring down emissions and power bills, to support our manufacturing businesses and to secure a critical revenue base as a result of this and other measures. A really important point here is that this government has added $188 billion of spending since it came into government. That's over $7,000 in extra spending for every Australian. And the way the government is paying for that is with huge revenues—unexpected revenues—coming from coal, from iron ore and from the gas industry. This is a measure that hasn't been thought through as it should have been to make sure we have a gas industry in the future—and I'll come back to that in a moment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is an opportunity for the government to engage in good faith on this measure, to support the future of the industry and to live with the same standard that the Prime Minister promised before the election. There's before-election and after-election with this Prime Minister, but let's go back to before-election, on 30 April 2022, when he told Kieran Gilbert this:</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">I think really people are sick of a government that has 'wedgislation', as I call it, looking to wedge the Opposition rather than legislation.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">He also said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I think Australians have got conflict fatigue.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This came from the Prime Minister, as I say, before the election. After the election, he had a very different approach, which was to provide us with exactly that 'wedgislation' that he didn't like in the first place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The sad and exhausting reality for Australians at home is that this is just another example of a Prime Minister promising one standard before an election and pursuing a different standard after it. The promise of $275 off their power bills was broken. Cheaper mortgages? That was a broken promise. Real wages increasing? That was a broken promise. No changes to franking credits? That was a broken promise. No taxes on super? That was a broken promise. No taxes on Australian businesses? That was a broken promise. This Prime Minister has broken more promises than he has delivered. The government is demonstrating that its approach to this bill puts politics first and what's right for this great country second.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me make a few comments about the PwC component of this bill, of this 'wedgislation'. The behaviour of PwC and the Tax Practitioners Board unveiled over the last year plainly doesn't meet community standards. It's important than any business contracting to government abide by their legal obligations. The coalition is continuing to support scrutiny of government practices surrounding the Tax Practitioners Board and the broader use of consultants. No-one is defending that behaviour, and no-one in this parliament, it seems to me, is defending or should defend that behaviour.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 1 increases the time the ATO has to bring an application for civil penalty proceedings to the Federal Court, increases the maximum penalty applicable and expands the application of promoter penalty laws. Penalties will be extended to significant global entities. The maximum penalties will increase 100-fold from the current $7.8 million to as much as $780 million.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 2 extends the whistleblower protections to individuals who make disclosures to the Tax Practitioners Board. Schedule 3 implements the second tranche of amendments from the TPB review to improve the register and boost investigative powers. Schedule 4 allows taxation officers and TPB officers to share protected information with Treasury about misconduct arising out of breaches, or suspected breaches, of confidence by intermediaries engaging with the Commonwealth.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition, Greens and Labor Party senators have approached these issues with a significant degree of bipartisanship over the last year. They are sensible measures that are worthy in principle, but they deserve to be dealt with in isolation. They deserve to be well dealt with in isolation, not packed together with a completely different issue, as this government is so often inclined to do. This is why the coalition will move amendments to separate the PRRT schedule from the bill. Our message to the government is simple: Deal with this like a mature government. Own the policies you have committed to. Do not come into this chamber and try to play games. We will not fall for it. That is why we will be bringing forward that amendment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me turn now to the PRRT schedule. The coalition wrote to the Treasurer proposing practical suggestions in exchange for our support for this component of the legislation. That will secure an additional revenue base. We are not a party that likes high taxes. We realise this is effectively a bring-forward of taxes. It is raising taxes in the shorter term, but what is critical here is that we don't deter investment. The proposals that we put forward were about making sure we continue to encourage the investment we need. They were modest and supported by industry. If this government were to come to the table, then we could have a sensible discussion about it. Instead, we've seen that rejected through no response. All we have seen is spokespeople in the media. The Treasurer himself wasn't even willing to say anything on it, not even in a reply letter.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's clear that the government's not serious about passing these laws but is trying to use the legislation as a political wedge. I would have thought, with the cost-of-living crisis and everything that Australians are facing right now, there were more important things to do than to play politics in this place. As I said earlier, we've seen the Treasurer bizarrely attaching these PRRT changes—which he knows are controversial—to a bill dealing with the PwC matter, which has bipartisanship support across all parties in the parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've extended an olive branch on the PRRT changes in good faith. The Treasurer needs to pick up the phone. If he wants the bill passed, he should come to the table and negotiate with us. If he's not prepared to do that, it just confirms what we've seen over the last 18 months: Labor cares more about playing politics than managing the economy, and Australians are paying a very high price for that. The Treasurer needs to decide whether his focus is on the economic wellbeing of all Australians or his political interests.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to finish with a couple of comments on the gas industry. We compete in this great country for investment in this industry and other resource industries with countries across the world. With gas in particular, there are three very large LNG exporters in the world: ourselves, the United States and Qatar. Global investors make a choice, and if we don't offer a regime that is going to work for those investors they will go elsewhere. We've put layer upon layer of barriers to investment in our gas industry in this country. We've seen new changes to the offshore gas regime, which are effectively halting investments in gas in Western Australia, and every Western Australian in this place should be deeply opposed to those changes. They're putting in place a new EPA, and that risks, again, slowing down and stopping the flow of investment we see in this important industry for this country, an industry that our manufacturers rely on, an industry that our export customers rely on, an industry that Australian small and large businesses right across the board rely on for cheap energy. And, if this government is serious about the future of the gas industry, then they need to sit down and work with us to make sure that those sensible proposals are negotiated and put through this place, and then we are very open to work with them on this PRRT legislation.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This mishandling of legislation is just another sign of a government that is more focused on politics than outcomes. We see this with the cost of living, we see this with energy policy and we see this with this bill. The coalition supports appropriate responses to the PwC matter—nobody disputes that. The coalition is even prepared to sit down and accept the changes that are being made to the PRRT, but it has to be accompanied by a future for our gas industry.</span>

I've got a dentist appointment this Friday, I'm so sorry, Michele. Before she became governor, Michele Bullock was sitting on an $828,000 salary; it'll be a million dollars now. I'm thinking of the woman in my electorate who has told me that, because of the interest rate rises, she's had to stop buying meat for her family for dinner. It's beyond insulting for someone on a million dollars to tell her that she has to forgo seeing the dentist—which she probably already can't afford—or the hairdresser. No-one is telling Coles or Woolies to make sacrifices—record billion-dollar profits. No-one is telling the Commonwealth Bank to make sacrifices—record $10 billion profits. But millions of everyday Australians are told to make sacrifice after sacrifice.</span>

Here's what they should do instead: first, compel the RBA to pause interest rates; second, implement a tax on excessive corporate profits and scrap the stage 3 tax cuts; third, tackle price gouging; and, finally, deliver immediate cost-of-living relief. They could start by bringing dental into Medicare so everyone can see the dentist. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Since 1983 Wollotuka has operated as a vital centre of support for First Nations students, ensuring higher education that is both academically enriching and culturally affirming. I was honoured to join with students, staff and community at Wollotuka last Friday to celebrate 40 years of remarkable success and to listen to the stories of those who were there from the beginning through to the staff and students of today. I especially want to recognise Associate Professor Kath Butler, Professor John Maynard, Dr Ray Kelly, Deidre Heitmeyer, Nathan Towney, Mandy Kelly, Cheryl Newton and so many more.</span>

It's like a big extended family providing much-needed social, cultural, financial, physical and emotional support to the largest number of First Nations students in any university in Australia, including the 2,041 First Nations students currently enrolled. This year 243 Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students will graduate from a wide range of degree programs. I pay tribute to the elders in residence, the cultural mentors and the Nguraki committee that provides guidance and advice on cultural standards, programs and protocols.</span>

Thank you, Rainbow Bay, Tweed Heads, Coolangatta, Kirra, North Kirra, Bilinga, Tugun, Currumbin, Palm Beach, Pacific and Tallebudgera.

There has been a more than 482 per cent increase in incidents of antisemitism in Australia since the 7 October attacks. Let me make something very clear. If you are targeting Jewish businesses in Australia, that is antisemitism. If you are targeting Jewish university students in Australia, that is antisemitism. If you are targeting Jewish school students in Australia, that is antisemitism. If you are targeting Jewish artists and creatives here in Australia, that is antisemitism.

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bass</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:36</span>):  Today I want to acknowledge the fantastic volunteers from Launceston Legacy. Jan, Geraldine and Cathy volunteer their time, week after week, to place wellbeing calls across northern Tasmania as part of the Legacy widows contact program. The program began about a decade ago, after Jan's husband, Peter Pfundt—who was a beneficiary when his father passed away when Peter was just four weeks old—suggested a change was needed to ensure Legacy could continue to be in contact with widows. 'As the years have gone on, there are less legatees, and they are much older. They just can't do what they used to,' Jan said. The number of widows has declined from around 1,500 to a little over 600, ranging in age from their early 50s to 101. 'The first call is very difficult, particularly with younger widows,' Jan said. 'We always ask if they would be happy for us to phone them, and nobody has ever said no.'</span>

Max's love for his volunteer work is supported by his motto 'If you don't use it, you will lose it'. Max recently received a set of four historical Legacy pins and the current centenary pin from Launceston Legacy to thank him for his five decades of service to the club. </span>

Lalie is only 12 years old. She attends Kincumber High School and is in year 7. She has a strong passion for tennis and trains multiple times a week to ensure that she is in peak physical and mental shape for her matches. Lalie lives with autism and several other intellectual disabilities but does not let these matters get in the way of her sporting ambitions. She has also combated periods of ill health in 2023; however, she's charging ahead with her tennis career. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Lalie will play at the Australian tennis championships PWII in Melbourne, representing New South Wales, this year, where I am sure she will play outstandingly and make us all proud. Of special note is that Lalie represented the Central Coast at the state tournament for the Special Olympics, where she placed third. I congratulate Lalie on her success with tennis, overcoming challenges throughout her life and continuing to maintain a positive outlook. </span>

It was a real delight talking with you recently about all of Lalie's sporting successes and accomplishments and what we can look forward to in the future. I'll be closely watching Lalie's sporting career over the coming years. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Calare</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:39</span>):  The families and homes of MPs should never be the target of political attacks. Last week I received a package sent via Australia Post to my home. The sender's address on the package appeared to be fictitious. My family and I, including my children, were very shocked and concerned that our home was being targeted. In accordance with protocol, I notified the Australian Federal Police, and they in turn contacted Orange police, who swiftly investigated and found that the package had been sent using a fake name, address and signature and was paid for with cash.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The CCTV at the post office revealed that the sender of the package was the chair of the Calare Federal Electorate Council of the New South Wales National Party, Janelle Culverson. She is a former Cabonne shire councillor, and, aside from the remaining state MPs, she is the most senior National Party member in the region. The package contained empty wine bottles bearing labels carrying an insulting message. When confronted by police over the weekend, she admitted to sending it. I have not spoken to Ms Culverson since January and do not regard her as a friend. This was no joke. I believe that the posting of the package, its contents and the steps taken by Ms Culverson to conceal her identity as the sender were designed to unsettle, create anxiety and fear amongst me and my family and also intimidate and pressure me into not contesting the seat of Calare at the next election. This is nasty, vicious and spiteful politics. I believe that our communities would be horrified, like I am, that the National Party has sunk to this filthy new low.</span>

It's a fantastic initiative to raise funds for Support Act, which is a music industry charity. It delivers crisis relief services to musicians, managers, crews and music workers across all genres, even rap. It doesn't discriminate. Rock 4 R'n'R, which stand for Rock for Reflection and Remembrance, is a veterans band, and I want to acknowledge them. They played in the parliament here a little while back. In fact, today the veterans minister and I repped their Rock 4 R'n'R T-shirts. Well done, Rob Pickersgill and Harry Moffitt. Harry Moffitt is also the lead singer of the Externals, a band from Perth coming out of the SAS regiment.</span>

Bunna Lawrie started the band in 1977 in South Australia. They played at the Darwin Railway Club the other night. They did their first Barunga Festival in 1985, and they're still sounding awesome. They're an example of the incredible First Nations music in our nation. I want to acknowledge Music NT and Darwin's Skinnyfish Music as well.</span>

I wish to thank all of those organisations among so many who assist those in my community who need a hand up: the Gold Coast Community Fund; St John's Crisis Centre; Serving Our People; Havafeed; Lindsay and Robyn Burch, who recently were named Queensland Senior Australians of the Year; and Men of Business Academy educational leaders for disaffected young men Jason Sessarago and Marco Renai, who was recently named Queensland Australian of the Year. To Moncrieff's other 33 beautiful schools: thank you for the work that you do with our precious children.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Parramatta</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:44</span>):  I'd like to take this opportunity to reflect on the life and legacy of Gorur Krishna Harinath OAM, who passed away on 18 November. Dr Hari, as he was affectionately known, arrived in Australia in 1971 from Hyderabad. After training as a doctor, he had a remarkable career of community service, especially in the world of cricket. In 2009 he was recognised in the Queen's Birthday Honours List and received an Order of Australia medal for his service to the sport and to his community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Throughout his life, Dr Hari championed multiculturalism. He was a passionate supporter of the Australia India Business Council and advocated for stronger bilateral relations. Dr Hari also served as chairperson of the Multicultural NSW Advisory Board and in 2017 was awarded the Pravasi Bharatiya Samman by the President of India—the highest honour conferred to an Indian living overseas. Through much of his time, Dr Hari ran a thriving local medical practice. His Eastgardens clinic was frequented by cricket greats along with community and business leaders.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our thoughts today are with his family and his friends. Dr Hari is remembered as a kind-hearted, thoughtful and passionate community leader who touched the lives of many. May he rest in peace.</span>

Today I'm thrilled to speak on behalf of 12-year-old Grace McMahon, from my electorate of Maranoa. Grace poses a serious question: how many people in Australia are struggling with the cost of living?

It was an opportunity to visit the country of my birth and share in what our government is doing and how we can improve our longstanding relationship. We had a very busy schedule of meetings, and it was much more than a diplomatic exchange; rather it was a dialogue of shared experiences and aspirations. We were acknowledged and warmly welcomed by the Prime Minister of Malaysia and fellow Malaysia parliamentarians. I was fortunate to have my background be an asset to my team. It fostered a connection that went above and beyond the formality of international relations. To be able to share my journey from Muar boy to Australian parliamentarian shows how the prospects in Australia are well and truly ripe for the picking.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New England</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:48</span>):  I rise today to say that we're getting close to the end of the year but I'm going to be part of a process of ending the year as we're going to start it next year. We have been trying so hard to get the member for McMahon to go to some of the demonstrations where people are clearly voicing their absolute disgust in the processes around both offshore wind factories and onshore wind factories. Madam Deputy Speaker Claydon, I've been in your area, where thousands of people turned up to protest against these wind factories, but they are not being listened to. In fact, the absurd position that the minister holds is that they are items of adornment. He thinks they are items of beauty. They are detested—and the transmission lines that come with them, the fact that they litter the landscape and the environmental damage they do. These things have to be stopped.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On Thursday, in Martin Place, there will be yet another demonstration, with people coming in from the Illawarra, from the country and from Newcastle. We say to the people of Paterson, Newcastle, Shortland, Dobell, Robertson, Cunningham, Whitlam, Gilmore and Eden-Monaro: if you're not listening now, you'll certainly be listening around election time, because the capacity to swing the votes, to change your future, is there. I look forward to once more addressing this. Might I say: don't worry; we're coming to Canberra early next year.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Holt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:50</span>):  The Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association, the union for workers in retail, fast food and warehousing, has recently launched a class action against Aldi. The class action is the result of a nationwide investigation the union has been conducting at Aldi which has found a practice of underpayment, not limited to a few workers or a few stores. Rather, the union has argued, Aldi systematically underpaid an estimated $150 million in wages to 20,000 current and former workers across its supermarkets and distribution centres. This includes directing workers to work up to 30 minutes without pay before and after their rostered shifts. The class action follows on from a Federal Court case run by the SDA in 2022 which found that Aldi underpaid workers at the New South Wales distribution centre by directing them to start work 15 minutes before their rostered start time. Workers deserve a fair day's pay for a fair day's work. I am proud that the SDA is steadfast in ensuring that every worker in retail, fast food and warehousing is paid what they deserve.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wright</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:51</span>):  A headline this week in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian</span> newspaper: 'Voters abandon Anthony Albanese as Labor's fortunes nosedive.' You sit and wonder: how did it all go so terribly wrong? Let me have a small ponder. On 200 occasions before the election, they promised a $275 reduction in electricity prices. That wasn't that hard to deliver, but most people are paying in excess of 20 per cent more for their power. They were told that under Labor that life was going to be better, but in fact they've received 12 interest rate rises consecutively. The average mortgage holder is paying in excess of thousands of dollars more. There was a $450 million referendum, which every jurisdiction, bar the Australian Capital Territory, comprehensively rejected. And it takes a special level of incompetence for a government to take nearly 200 days to deliver a 90-day infrastructure review. If it's not on the economic front that Labor are struggling, maybe it could be the release of hardcore criminals out onto the streets, as we speak, going into the Christmas break. Maybe that has had something to do with their nosediving fortunes. The only thing they seem to have successfully done is to fill the boardroom tables with their Labor mates.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moreton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:53</span>):  Hailing from St George in outback Queensland, I swam in the Balonne River and surfed through a couple of heatwaves as a kid, but being a 10-kilometre marathon swimmer was certainly never anything I imagined. For Chelsea Gubecka, however, with her silver medal at the 2023 world championships, I can say she's a natural. I proudly congratulate Chelsea on being the first Australian athlete named in the 2024 Paris Olympic squad. Chelsea trains at the mighty Yeronga pool, like basically half of the Olympic and Paralympic team at the moment. It's great to see young talent coming out of my electorate and shining on the world stage. Hopefully seeing people like Chelsea performing for her country will inspire other young athletes to chase their dreams. With the 2032 Olympics being hosted in Brisbane, I don't doubt that there are many future Olympians training in Moreton right now. The folks at Yeronga pool will be eagerly watching Chelsea at the 2024 Paris Olympics and Paralympics, like I will be. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Hosting the Olympics in Brisbane and surrounds in 2032 will be a great honour. Obviously, we'll have that home advantage and we'll foster our great tradition of sporting prowess, especially in the water. I congratulate Chelsea once again on her selection in the 2024 Olympic squad. I look forward to seeing all of our Olympians and Paralympians representing Australia in Paris in eight months time. After that, the runway through to Brisbane becomes very close—LA next and then Brisbane.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fadden</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:54</span>):  Recently I met with a young couple from Coombabah who have two young school-age children and a mortgage. These are aspiring middle-class Australians who want to give back to their community wherever possible. They told me just how hard things are under this incompetent Labor government. Just 18 months after the change in federal government, they've seen their mortgage climb by more than $20,000. Their electricity bill continues to climb out of control. Shopping for groceries at the Runaway Bay Woolies is getting harder and harder as inflation bites. They don't want to cancel the kids' soccer or dancing lessons, but the cost-of-living crisis means that something has to give.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While the government assure the public that they have a plan and it's working, the reality is that they have the wrong priorities and continue to make poor decisions that are making things worse for families in my electorate. The Reserve Bank governor has confirmed that Australia's world-leading inflation is being driven by domestic factors, but the Prime Minister and the Treasurer continue to sell the fanciful story that it's driven by overseas. Under the leadership of those on the other side of this chamber, I don't blame the young Coombabah family for being pessimistic. This Labor government has formed a habit of breaking promises and, sadly, Australians are paying the price. The only hope for Australian families is the hope of the return of a coalition government.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bendigo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:56</span>):  I've got great news for the House. This government's tripling of the bulk-billing incentive has made a profound change in my electorate of Bendigo. I can proudly say that 18 of the 20 medical centres surveyed in my electorate are now bulk-billing at least one of the eligible groups. In fact, 50 per cent said that they are now bulk-billing everybody that comes through their door. This is an exciting day for us—that we have been able to turn around bulk-billing in my electorate. They said that the incentive was a direct measure that saw more GPs choosing to bulk-bill, and they are so relieved that they don't have to have those awkward conversations with patients who are seeking care when they need it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What I'm also excited about is that the clinics who continued to bulk-bill, despite those opposite freezing the incentive and the rebate for so long, are now being paid what they should be paid for bulk-billing their patients. I am so excited to see the clinics in my electorate embracing bulk-billing and to see it restored. We have even seen some of the old bulk-billing signs pulled out and put out the front, encouraging people to see their GP because the clinic will now bulk-bill. This is just the beginning of what we are doing to restore Medicare and rebuild bulk-billing in our electorates.</span>

From my experience, you will see courage on the sporting field, in our health and emergency service workers, and in our Australian Defence Force personnel who can help people who can't necessarily help themselves.

As the member for Dunkley reminded me this morning, she was no saint. I always remember the night when we overindulged in espresso martinis in New York and she accosted actress Rose Byrne and her family, and then proudly told me she'd also been having a conversation with K Flip. I told the member for Dunkley that her name is actually G Flip, to which the member for Dunkley replied, 'Well, actually, it's K Flip to all her friends.'</span>

She is facing those challenges with courage, humility and good humour. It is bloody hard to watch. But I know she has earnt the respect of all members in this place, on both sides of the chamber. We wish her great health and happiness as she faces those challenges in the days ahead. In the words of Pippi Longstocking: please remember you are the strongest girl in the world.

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">That the House record its deep regret at the death, on 21 October 2023, of the Honourable Bill Hayden AC, a former Governor-General of the Commonwealth of Australia from 1989 to 1996, a former Leader of the Australian Labor Party, Minister and Member for the Division of Oxley from 1961 to 1988, place on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service, and tender its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Earlier this month, when the jacarandas were in full bloom, hundreds of mourners gathered at St Mary's in Ipswich to celebrate the life of Bill Hayden. In all its dignity, its humility and its understated strength, it was a fitting setting in which to say farewell to this softly spoken giant.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bill was a giant who didn't cast a shadow but, rather, cast a light on the way ahead. When he first arrived in parliament as the new member for Oxley, Bill spoke of the honour and privilege he felt not just representing his constituents here in the heart of our democracy but doing so as a member of the Australian Labor Party—and what a remarkable member he became, this child of the Depression turned policeman, who was able to see in Labor not just the best party to advance his values but how to make possible the renewal Labor had to go through so that it could gain strength and grow. Bill succeeded, and all of us on this side of the House are in his debt.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What Bill Hayden gave the Australian Labor Party was the chance of a future. Patiently, humbly, courageously, he gave Labor fresh relevance and a new focus. He made it possible for Labor to return to our core mission of governing in the national interest and lifting the lives of Australians. Without ever residing in the Lodge, Bill Hayden was the fulcrum on which the Labor Party's fortunes turned for the better. His leadership laid the foundation for the social and economic reforms that created three decades of consecutive economic growth and delivered Australia a new era in education, foreign affairs, environment policy and, of course, universal health care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's one thing for us to look back, of course. Put yourself in Bill's shoes for a moment and consider the scale of the challenge that he took on: a party slowly emerging from over two decades of opposition after the split, lifted high by the 1972 Whitlam election victory, and then a fleeting moment in office so devastatingly cut short by the dismissal. With clarity, discipline and intellectual rigour, Bill could envision the road along which Labor would have to travel if it was to live up to its values and potential. As he told Labor's national conference in 1979, 'We will not find our future in the past.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But for Bill the road to the future was sometimes a bumpy one. In the aftermath of 1975 he was the last Labor MP left standing in Queensland. He served as leader through six hard years in opposition, only to be denied at the last moment the chance to lead the party to an election many believed he would have won. Yet, as Paul Keating observed in his eulogy at St Mary's, his momentum persisted. Just as Bill understood that the entry ticket to becoming a credible opposition was earning the public's trust on economic management, he knew that, to be a government that truly meant something, its actions had to speak louder than just the words. And nothing about Bill Hayden spoke so loudly as his deeds. They add up to a remarkable record that is a rare joint triumph of quality and quantity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a reforming Minister for Social Security, Bill introduced Medibank, Australia's first plan for universal health care. As a former police officer who had learned all too well how poverty can trap women in violent relationships he introduced Australia's first single mother's pension—and I was a beneficiary of that change. As foreign minister he laid the groundwork for the plan that would finally bring peace to Cambodia. He was ahead of so many with his advocacy for gay rights. And, crucially, he empowered a new generation of talent, planting the seeds of what would grow into an extraordinary legacy of reform.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Every single step of the way he had his eyes on a stronger future, always seeking out ways to translate his love for Australia into the reality of an even better Australia. He never lost his faith in our party's capacity to improve our country. Nor did he ever doubt Australia's ability to make a difference in the world. And throughout all the ups and all the downs he never lost his sense of humour; he never lost sight of what mattered.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, as the jacarandas are slowly losing their purple, we say our final farewell to this remarkable Queenslander, to this great Australian, this man of integrity, courage and substance. We offer our gratitude for all that Bill was and for all that he achieved, and we thank his family—who, I want to acknowledge, are here with us today on the floor of the parliament—for sharing their husband and father with us.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I offer our sincerest condolences to Georgina, Ingrid, Kirk and all the other family members but particularly to Bill's beloved wife, Dallas. Dallas and Bill were each other's great fortune—two bright suns who warmed each other from the moment they met. I know it was difficult for you to get here today, Dallas, and, on behalf of the parliament, we appreciate it, and we give you our warmth and our love. May Bill Hayden rest in peace.</span>

                  <a href="00AKI" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr DUTTON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dickson</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Opposition</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:07</span>):  I join with the Prime Minister and congratulate him on his fine heartfelt words in honouring the life of William George Hayden AC.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're all a product of our environment, and Bill Hayden described himself as a product of the Great Depression. We celebrate Bill's life because he escaped his impoverished background and made remarkable contributions in public life to our country. We admire Bill's character because he never forgot his roots.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bill was born in 1933, and unemployment was 31 per cent. He was the son of a father and mother who'd been busted by the Depression. Bill described the 1930s as 'tough and mean times which made so many men and women hard and bitter'. Growing up in the suburbs of South Brisbane, filled with 'downtrodden men, dispirited women and doleful faces', Bill had the odds stacked against him. He wrote later in life, 'I was heading for hell on a fast track.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But Bill used his working-class background and his environment as motivation to rise above it. Indeed, Bill's upbringing helped him to acquire wisdom beyond years about give and take, about forgiving and forgetting, about 'getting up and having another go in the face of adversity', as he eloquently put it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">During the Second World War Bill was impressed by the American servicemen and the atmosphere of Australian wartime responsibility. That sense of duty propelled him into the Public Service postwar. But he described his job as a clerk as 'the pits'. So, he chanced his arm with the Queensland Police to 'do good', in his words. Constable Hayden served with the Queensland Police Force for seven years. He encountered pub brawlers, contended with wife-beaters and dealt with cases of incest. After a while, there was not much behaviour that shocked Bill, but no black hole was worse for him than advising a wife and mother that her husband had been killed. He wrote: 'The work of a policeman can make one suspicious and conservative in many respects. It can also encourage compassion as a result of sharing in so much of other people's tragedy and suffering.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was Bill's sense of justice and desire to address injustice which saw him want to bring about change on a scale that he could not achieve in uniform. So he pursued the path to political office. Bill was preselected by Labor to contest the supposedly unwinnable seat of Oxley in the 1961 election, but win it Bill did, with a more than nine per cent swing, and he would hold Oxley for more than 26 years. In his maiden parliamentary speech, the working-class Bill stood up for his own in defending Queensland's coalminers, railway workers, timber cutters and dairy and beef farmers. He spoke with great pride of his Labor Party, describing it as 'one which does not seek to pander to the dictates of the powerful minority groups and affluent sections of society, whose interests so often are detrimental to the majority of Australians'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When Gough Whitlam's time came, in 1972, it was time for Hayden, as Minister for Social Security, to bring about the changes he yearned to see in Australian society. A former police officer who had seen the destitution of so many single mothers, he introduced welfare support which alleviated some hardships and provided more financial independence. The impact of this policy is conveyed in one woman's letter to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Age</span>, which was published the day after Bill's death. She wrote:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">My deepfelt thanks to Bill Hayden for the introduction of the single mother's pension. I personally benefited from this and it made a tangible difference to my family.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bill was also the architect of Australia's first universal health insurance scheme, Medibank. As the Prime Minister has noted, there could have been no Medicare without Medibank. I'd add that Bob Hawke's successful government would not have been possible without Bill Hayden's successful groundwork. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the wake of the dismissal and Labor's defeats in 1975 and 1977, Hayden served as much more than a bridge between the Whitlam and Hawke governments; Bill Hayden rebuilt the Labor castle with stronger foundations and sturdier walls. He put in place a system of discipline which governed the castle. He learnt from Whitlam's mistakes and excesses. He adopted a more centrist and pragmatic policy platform, especially to rein in spending and restore economic credibility. Bill astutely observed, 'We cannot achieve social reform unless we competently manage the economy.' </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bill Hayden speedily transformed the Labor Party, taking it from a position of woe into a winnable position. Indeed, the more than four per cent swing to Labor in the 1980 election, against Malcolm Fraser's coalition, was a truly remarkable outcome. The result should have justified Bill remaining as Labor leader and contesting the 1983 election, but it was not to be. Bob Hawke became the custodian of the party which Bill Hayden had restored, a party which delivered the best Labor government Australians have known. Hayden put his party and the Australian people ahead of his own personal ambition. As foreign affairs minister in Bob Hawke's cabinet, Bill brought tact and gravitas to a position which demanded both qualities amidst the backdrop of the Cold War.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In life, Bill Hayden underwent many conversions—from idealist to realist, from democratic socialist to social democrat, from radically minded to more conservative minded, from contemplating joining the Communist Party to joining the editorial board of <span style="font-style:italic;">Quadrant</span>, from atheist to Catholic and, most notably, from impoverished boy to illustrious man—indeed, a man who served our country at the highest level, with the greatest distinction, along with his wife, as our 21st Governor-General. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">During his Labor leadership Bill was plagued by self-doubt. When he lost the leadership, he said he felt like a total failure. My hope is that, in his twilight years, Bill underwent a final conversion, from a disposition of self-doubt to one of self-assurance. I hope that Bill had an absolute sense of his self-worth and the realisation that the totality of his achievements made him a truly great Australian. For any Australian who feels they're overcome by life's setbacks, Bill Hayden reminds us of how the setbacks of life can be overcome through sheer hard work, a sense of duty and a stoic temperament. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On behalf of the coalition, I offer my heartfelt condolences to Bill's devoted wife, Dallas; to his much-cherished children, Georgina, Ingrid and Kirk; to his Labor Party colleagues; and to his many friends. Bill is now reunited with his beloved daughter and first child, Michaela. May he rest in peace. </span>

                  <a href="37998" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr CHALMERS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Rankin</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Treasurer</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:14</span>):  Thank you to the Prime Minister and the opposition leader for wonderful, heartfelt tributes which do great justice to the life of a great man. Thanks in particular to Dallas, Georgina, Ingrid and Kirk for the loving and indispensable role they played in Bill Hayden's immense contribution to his community and our country; thank you for including us in that beautiful, inspiring, uplifting funeral at St Mary's in Ipswich, and thank you for making the effort to be with us as we console you in your loss and celebrate a quite remarkable life. Thank you to the House for the opportunity to speak as an admirer of Bill Hayden's but also as a successor and as a Queenslander. In that regard I acknowledge the member for Moreton, the member for Lilley and especially the members for Blair and yourself, Mr Speaker, who now represent Bill's old stomping ground to the west of Brisbane.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bill Hayden was a wonderful Queenslander and a fine Australian. Photos of his time in leadership and as Treasurer reveal that he had a particular Queenslander's style as well. Paul Kelly, from the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian</span>, wrote of Bill's uniquely Queensland sense of colour contrast—open-necked blue, white and pale blue sports outfits. Bill Hayden was a selfless safari-suited servant of the Australian people and the Australian Labor movement. He was grounded and respected. Dennis Atkins wrote about how self-effacing he was. Wayne Swan spoke about how he reminded us that politics can be an honourable profession. Sister Angela Mary Doyle spoke about how Bill Hayden was always in the search for purpose and not just publicity. He was somehow humble and historic at the same time, and that was really his genius—to take what he gleaned from real people in real communities like the ones we represent and translate that into real and lasting change here at home but also, as the Prime Minister said, around the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sometimes in the history books Bill Hayden is regarded as a transitional figure between Whitlam and Hawke. I think that sells him short because Bill Hayden was much, much more than a transitional figure; he was a transformational figure as well. He knew that his job wasn't to be a custodian or a curator of the past or to mind the shop for those who would come after him; he was bigger and bolder and more ambitious for Australia than that, and that was reflected in his immense achievements. Perhaps the finest praise that we can bestow on him was that he never forgot where he came from. From Highgate Hill to high office, he was by all accounts the same decent man—from the rented weatherboard cottage on stilts with the corrugated iron roof and the outdoor dunny on Mabel Street, from St Ita's Convent, walking without shoes to a little school across the river, from the new University of Queensland all the way to Government House.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was the Ipswich community, as you know, Mr Speaker, that informed and developed and inspired him for over 60 years. His life and experience shaped the policies for which he is best known—the pension for single mums, Medibank and much more. He was Labor leader, he was social security minister before that and he was foreign minister and Governor-General after that. He was also Australia's 27th Treasurer, but his impact, including on economic policy, went well beyond the five months he served in that role in the dying days of the Whitlam government. That's why among the mourners at St Mary's on that day the Prime Minister has described were the 30th, the 34th, the 36th and the 41st treasurers. I know that I speak on behalf of Paul, John, Wayne and myself when I say we share an enormous unbounded regard for Bill Hayden and his enduring example. I think that's because he was able to unite the competing tensions of his time—warm hearts and hardheads, responsibility and reform, pragmatism and principle, ends and means. He knew, as the opposition leader said, that everything we wanted to do for people was built on the most solid foundations of responsible economic management.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This wasn't always the tone or the tenor of his time, so he changed it, and he changed us. He did more than deliver us to the doorstep of victory in 1983; he put us in a position to change the country for the better. Without his efforts, the reform burst of the 1980s and 1990s wouldn't have been possible. This is something acknowledged by Paul Keating, who said Australia's 'quarter century of uninterrupted growth began its long coalescence the day Bill Hayden convened his first shadow cabinet meeting'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bill's handing of the leadership over to Bob Hawke with the prime ministership in full view was an act of selflessness unrivalled before or since. It was a defining act in the political history of this country. But, as Troy Bramston, Niki Savva and others have all written, he didn't just hand over a party ready to govern; he handed over the most remarkable combination of talent and purpose, and what became the Hawke cabinet was really Bill Hayden's personal legacy to go along with the policy and the political. He created the foundations of the best Australian government since Curtin and Chifley.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bill Hayden never forgot where he came from, and we will never forget him. We will never forget the contribution he made to his community or our country. At the end of a long a tireless life of service and selflessness, of humility and history, may he now rest in the warm embrace of our country's gratitude, our admiration and our respect, and may he rest in peace.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr LITTLEPROUD</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Maranoa</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Nationals</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:21</span>):  On behalf of the Nationals, it is a great honour to associate myself and our party with the fine words of the Prime Minister, the opposition leader and the Treasurer. It is with a heavy heart that I extend our condolences and sincere respects to the family, friends and colleagues of the Hon. Bill Hayden, AC. His passing on 21 October was an enormous loss for our nation. As we honour Bill's memory today, our thoughts and sympathies are with everyone who knew, loved and cherished him, especially his family—his wife, Dallas, and children, Kirk, Georgina and Ingrid. When we reflect on the life of Bill Hayden, members on all sides of this parliament will remember an exceptional record of public service. We will remember a man of leadership, conviction and purpose and we will remember an incredible Australian who made a tremendous contribution to our nation and who has left a legacy that will continue to endure into the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bill lived an extraordinary life. In many ways, he was a larger-than-life figure, such was his impact on public policy, on the federal parliament, on the Labor Party and on our nation. Born into a working-class family in Brisbane in the midst of the Great Depression, Bill did it tough growing up. He saw and experienced himself the raw pain of poverty and social disadvantage. However, these difficult circumstances did not hold him back. In fact, it was these experiences that galvanised Bill. It affirmed inside him a genuine need to support the downtrodden and the marginalised. It was a burning desire which would always spur him on, motivate him and drive his sense of public service and duty.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Famously, after he left school and served in the police force, young Bill Hayden was elected as the Labor member for Oxley in 1961 at just 28 years of age. What would follow was a parliamentary career that was defined by many achievements. Among the most significant was during his time as the Labor leader in the aftermath of the defeat of the Whitlam government in 1977. Demonstrating leadership, professionalism, drive and a ferocious work ethic, Bill Hayden rapidly brought the Labor Party back to life from the fringes of opposition, winning a net gain of 13 seats in the 1980 election and coming close to defeating the Fraser coalition government. It was this remarkable result that laid the foundations for the Labor Party to form government under Bob Hawke just a few years later.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">However, resigning from the Labor leadership in 1983 did not end Bill's accomplishments in politics or public policy. As Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade in the Hawke government during the eighties, he was a forceful advocate who drove and secured more engagement between Australia and our neighbours in the Asia-Pacific region. Crucially, Bill led peace efforts in Cambodia which paved the way for its 1983 peace settlement. He opened up the Australian economy and, despite internal political pressure, he approved critical support for the maintenance of joint defence facilities with the US. After his retirement from politics in 1988, Bill would then go on to serve with honour and distinction as Australia's Governor-General, a position that he held for a near-record seven years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All of these are legacies to be immensely proud of, but, despite his many successes over a long and decorated career, Bill Hayden never compromised on his working-class values and principles. In his 1984 account about the power struggles of the Hawke Labor government, Paul Kelly fittingly wrote:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Hayden's attitude was old-fashioned and uncompromisingly working-class: what you see is what you get.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bill was a leader who was tenacious about what he believed in. He was a loyal and faithful servant of the Labor movement, and no-one could ever doubt the sincerity of his morals or the decency of his character. Today, this parliament stands united in celebrating his life and honouring his memory. May he rest in peace.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Time">14:26</span>):  As the current federal member for Oxley and Speaker of the House of Representatives, it is with great sadness I offer my heartfelt condolences on the passing of the honourable Bill Hayden AC to Mrs Dallas Hayden AM, Georgina, Ingrid and Kirk and all of those in our community who loved Bill. It's fair to say there has been no-one more loved and respected who has served the people of south-west Brisbane and Ipswich than Bill. Bill will always be remembered with reverence in our community and without question will always be known as the best member for Oxley. Bill's legacy will continue to inspire the next generation just as his legacy continues to inspire me every day. May he rest in eternal peace.</span>

Last week a great many Australians read the extraordinary open letter from South Australian Commissioner of Police Grant Stevens and his wife, Emma, about their youngest son, Charlie. In their words, he was 'a lovable ratbag from the moment he could talk'. Tragically, it was a letter in which Charlie's parents laid bare their broken hearts. Just hours after Commissioner Stevens addressed the state about the tragic shooting death of police officer Jason Doig, he and Emma received the news no parent ever wants to get. Charlie had been the victim of an alleged hit-and-run incident.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Charlie was the 101st fatality on South Australian roads this year. Eventually the letter comes to this:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's little wonder that journalists who asked to read the letter on air broke down in tears. It is so deeply personal, so perfectly true to the life of one young man in one loving family, yet it is somehow so universal, so faithful to the joyful chaos, the perfect mess, the vibrancy of our children as they grow into young adults, and so achingly powerful as it deals with every parent's very worst fear. Yet, even knowing that what prompted this letter is the cruel injustice of a young man snatched away from all who loved him and all he loved, what shines through is not anger or despair; it is an enduring and eternal love.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But this letter was not written in search of sympathy. It was published to make us think, to ask us to reflect on the true nature of the road toll: not a number but the bright and beloved heart of a universe and a toll that is taken on all those who are left only with memories. Our hearts go out to Charlie's family and to every family that has ever been left to pick up the pieces.</span>

I spoke to the Prime Minister about the prospect of asking this question today, and I did so because I've had some interactions with Commissioner Stevens over the years and I've found him to be a thoroughly decent man, a man who has dedicated himself, along with his family, to the community of South Australia.</span>

During that interview I undertook that I would read out the letter which has been penned by both of Charlie's parents, Grant and Emma. The letter reads as follows:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">101 hated cheese because his brother did. He was a master of the airfryer, the nutrabullet and the steamer. He loved his mum's curried sausages but he didn't know where the dishwasher was …</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">His favourite pastime was pushing mum's buttons—although a different name is on his birth certificate, "f*** off Charlie" was what you would hear most in our house, followed closely by "put a shirt on" or "take your hat off at the table".</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">101 had a circle of friends the rest of us could only dream about. He loved his mates and they loved him. His friends' parents liked having 101 in their homes. He was mates with his brother's mates. Living with him meant waking up on weekends to four or five extra bodies in spare beds and on couches. It meant the family garage being transformed into a man cave where things parents did not know about (or probably permit) could happen.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">The only time we saw 101 truly angry was when he was forced to cut his precious hair for his sister's wedding in 2021. He never went back to a hairdresser again.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Being 101's alarm clock was a role his mum and I took up when he left school and started his apprenticeship. "Get up mate", "get up mate", "mate, get up", "are you not going to work today?", followed by "drive safely and don't speed" becoming the morning mantra.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberAnswer">Mr BOWEN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">McMahon</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Climate Change and Energy</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:37</span>):  I thank my honourable friend for her question and thank her for her leadership in our part of the world, south Western Sydney. It's great to have such a strong member of parliament to work so closely with. The constituents of Werriwa know, as the constituents right around Australia know, that we need more reliable energy and we need more of it quickly. We need that because of the situation that we're dealing with, where, over the last 10 years, for example, we had 24 coal plants announce their closure—equivalent to almost 27 gigawatts of power announced to leave the grid, with no coordinated plan to replace it. We know over the last 10 years we saw four gigawatts of dispatchable power leave the grid and only one gigawatt come on to replace it. That has meant our energy system has been increasingly reliant on those coal-fired power stations that are left and that are ageing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This has caused challenges. Just in recent weeks we've had two units at one of the largest coal-fired power stations in Australia, Eraring, out of action, and we've had one of the Callide units out of action since May 2021 and not returning until May next year because of a major interruption. So we need more energy investment. That's why this government has introduced the Capacity Investment Scheme and the gas code. Both are very important for reliable energy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am asked what obstacles there are. There haven't been many obstacles to the Capacity Investment Scheme because it has received such wide support from energy users, energy producers, climate groups, governments across Australia. Energy ministers met last week, and the communique unanimously endorsed the Albanese government's Capacity Investment Scheme—governments all across Australia, including the Liberal minister for energy from Tasmania and the Greens minister for energy from the ACT. The Tasmanian minister for energy issued a very strong statement. Minister Nick Duigan issued a strong statement on behalf of the Rockliff government welcoming the Albanese government's Capacity Investment Scheme. That's a big step forward.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know those opposite didn't get the memo. They didn't agree with their Tasmanian colleagues. They don't agree with the former New South Wales government, the Perrottet government, which supported our Capacity Investment Scheme. But that's a matter for them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Also, there's the gas code. The gas code was introduced to ensure that there is an anchor on prices and more supply. The Greens have moved a disallowance. I said yesterday we didn't know how the Liberals were going to vote. It turns out they didn't know how they were going to vote either. They didn't turn up. They abstained. The Greens' disallowance motion was defeated, although, when they looked around the Senate chamber, they found they were voting with One Nation, with Senator Babet and with Senator Canavan, who crossed the floor. If you're a Greens senator who has moved a motion about energy and you look around and find you're accompanied by One Nation, Senator Babet and Senator Canavan, you might say, 'We've made a rather large error.' And they did.</span>

We just do it respectfully and within the Comprehensive Strategic Partnership that we have with China. It is very important to Australia, and it enables us to engage with them on any number of issues, which we will continue to do. But we're not about to do those things in a way that is public.' They then went on, and he said, 'I'm not going to go into the discussion.' That's what the member for Cook said. He didn't leak a text message on that occasion but said, very clearly, that that was the case. I make this point, to someone who sat on the NSC for a period of time and all of that: every incident with China on this government's watch and every incident that has impacted Australian Defence Force personnel has been revealed publicly and has gone directly to China as well to make our position clear. On this government's watch, that has always happened. I'd be interested in whether that can be said across the board.

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Franklin</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Housing, Minister for Homelessness and Minister for Small Business</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:44</span>):  I want to thank the terrific member for Dunkley for that question. I know that she understands that the legislation we'll be bringing to parliament this week will help home buyers in her electorate and, indeed, across the country. Indeed, this will be life-changing for so many Australians. There are people renting at the moment who could certainly service a mortgage but can't get over the 20 per cent deposit hurdle. Help to Buy will help those who are renting or living at home to get over the hurdle of this deposit. This is targeted help for low- and middle-income Australians to get into a home with just a two per cent deposit. The government will support eligible homebuyers with up to a 40 per cent contribution for new homes and up to 30 per cent for existing properties. This will help bring homeownership back into reach for thousands of Australians, particularly for those who are renting.</span>

                  </a>  Importantly, it won't just be a leg-up into homeownership with savings for a smaller deposit. Help to Buy will provide long-term relief to Australians who are part of this scheme. It could help eligible homeowners save hundreds every month on a mortgage.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">States will need to pass their own legislation for Help to Buy to operate in their states. The state and territory leaders committed to this at National Cabinet in August and, indeed, just last week housing ministers reaffirmed that they want to get this happening. Help to Buy will provide 10,000 places each year for four years, so we will be supporting into homeownership more than 40,000 Australians who otherwise would not have been able to purchase a home. As I said, this will be life-changing for so many Australians, particularly those on low and middle incomes.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our housing agenda is broader than that, of course, with our Regional First Home Buyer Guarantee and the Home Guarantee Scheme, which we have, of course, expanded to include siblings and friends, allowing people who have been out of homeownership for more than a decade to get back into homeownership. Indeed, the expanded Home Guarantee Scheme has now helped more than 86,000 people into homeownership since we have been in office. Almost one-third of first home buyers are now entering the market through this scheme. Indeed, our broad housing agenda includes our $10 billion Housing Australia Future Fund.</span>

In August, National Cabinet committed to strengthening renters' rights by ending no-grounds evictions, limiting rent increases to once a year and phasing in minimum rental standards. But, three months on, not enough has changed. Renters are facing the highest rent increases since 2009, there are continued no-grounds evictions, and there are rising power bills because of poor home energy performance. When will the commitments made by National Cabinet be implemented across all states and territories, and will this include ending no-cause evictions at the end of a fixed term?</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grayndler</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Prime Minister</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:49</span>):  I thank the member for Wentworth for her question and for her engagement on housing issues, something that she has taken as one of the issues that she'll continually raise in this national parliament.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that a lot of people across Australia are finding it tough to find an affordable place to rent. More than 30 per cent of Australians were renting a home at the last census. We hear renters' concerns and we're acting to address them. That's why at National Cabinet in August the Commonwealth, state and territory governments committed to a better deal for renters—to harmonise and strengthen renters' rights across Australia. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm asked about what has happened since then, because obviously state and territory governments are responsible for the implementation of that. I can indicate to the member for Wentworth that at National Cabinet next Wednesday we will hear a report from states and territories as well about the actions that they are taking.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There certainly has been substantial action. In South Australia on 1 November they introduced landmark rental reforms to the parliament to improve security for tenants. They introduced prescribed grounds to terminate or not renew a tenancy, extend the notice period to end a tenancy from 28 days to 60 days, allow tenants to have pets in rental homes, protect tenants' information, ensure rental properties comply with minimum housing standards and provide additional support for victims of domestic violence. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Queensland the Palaszczuk government doubled the rental security subsidy after the housing summit to cover up to $10,000 for 12 months. In the last quarter, between July and September, $9.7 million was provided to almost 1,700 new households for things like rent, rent increases, bonds and other supports. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Victoria on 14 November the Minister for Consumer Affairs, Gabi Williams, announced that organisations delivering support for renters in the private market can register for the $2 million rental stress support package, which is there. These organisations provide information, advice, advocacy and legal assistance to Victorian households. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Western Australia on 9 November the Cook government announced new regulations for unhosted short-term rental accommodations in WA, along with an incentive aimed at returning some properties to the long-term rental market to help increase housing supply; all short-term rental accommodation providers to be required to register properties; a new $10,000 incentive for property owners to transition existing short-term rental accommodation into long-term rental homes for Western Australians; and reforms to provide consistency across the sector and clarity on what is required to operate a short-term rental accommodation property. <span style="font-style:italic;">(</span><span style="font-style:italic;">Time expired</span><span style="font-style:italic;">)</span></span>

Of course, those opposite say that they also support the Murray-Darling Basin Plan, but, in their close to a decade in government, they did everything they could to stymie and undermine the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. In fact, more than 80 per cent of all water that has been recovered towards the plan has been recovered when Labor has been in government—just 16 per cent under those opposite. Of the target of 450 gigalitres of additional environmental water, those opposite achieved just two. In fact, what they did was ignore more than 10 warnings from the Murray-Darling Basin Authority—</span>

The government has put enhancing economic opportunity for women at the heart of our agenda, and it is making a difference. Women's workforce participation is at a record high, providing more economic security for women. Today the Workplace Gender Equality Agency announced the gender pay gap has decreased by 1.1 per cent this year. This is the second-largest single-year drop since the agency started collecting employer data in 2014. The government's work to demand more transparency and accountability in reporting the gender pay gap is having an impact. The executive CEO of the agency, Mary Wooldridge, said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Publishing gender pay gaps requires employers to understand their unique challenges, develop a purpose-built approach to gender equality and then take intentional and sustained action.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know there's more work to do. We won't rest till we have closed the gender pay gap. Let's not forget that, under the last government, women lost out. On their watch Australia fell to 70th in the world for women's economic participation and opportunity. Under this government, Australia's world gender equality ranking has jumped up 17 places, from 43rd to 26th, the largest increase since the index began way back in 2006. It's not surprising, because of the action that we're taking—expanding paid parental leave; making child care cheaper; implementing all 55 recommendations of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Respect@Work</span> report; establishing 10 days paid family and domestic violence leave; investing $2.3 billion to end domestic violence; funding a 15 per cent pay rise for aged-care workers, who are overwhelmingly women; and improving the single parenting payment, helping 52,000 single mums. All of these measures are making a difference. They all are what has been seen as low-hanging fruit of economic growth and productivity gains. Issues such as support for child care are not welfare; they're about economic participation and productivity improvements, and they make a difference not just for women but for the entire nation.</span>

Of course, it was the High Court that required the release of the detainees, and this government, like all governments, is required to abide by the decisions of the High Court. In respect of the issue he raises, I should be very clear about a couple of things. The first one is that, as he would be well aware—as all members would be well aware—this government does not comment on operational or individual matters. Can I also say to members in this place and to the Australian community that the Australian community should be assured that all efforts, coordinated under Operation AEGIS, are being made to track down this individual. Again, I commend the work of the Australian Border Force and the Australian Federal Police, working with state and territory law enforcement officials to ensure community safety.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I might say two other things, if I may, on this. Firstly, the High Court has just handed down its reasons for its decision in the matter which led to this, a matter in which of course the Commonwealth vigorously opposed the case brought by the plaintiff. I make that very clear. We will be considering those reasons for decisions and, I hope, working with all members and indeed all senators to put in place a strong legal framework, an enduring legal framework, for community safety. But, on that note, I remind the shadow minister and all members that yesterday a bill passed through the House to strengthen the regime for community safety.</span>

He also voted against arrangements to improve electronic monitoring. He, like the Leader of the Opposition, likes to talk tough and he likes to talk about strength, but his voting record is exactly the opposite. Tough talk does not keep communities safe. Strong laws do. Why won't they vote for them?</span>

It gives me the opportunity to address the complete hypocrisy of the last question that came from those opposite. The No. 1 priority of our government is the safety of the Australian community. I want to credit the minister for immigration on the leadership that he has shown on leading us through what has been a difficult High Court decision.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We always hope in Australian politics—and I certainly know that the community out there hopes for this—that, when it comes to matters like the protection of Australians, the two major parties can stand together in a bipartisan manner. So let's look at what the opposition have done in relation to community safety in recent days. What we have heard is a lot of rhetoric from those opposite talking about community safety, but we heard from the minister for immigration about something unspeakable that has happened recently, done by a frontbench member of those opposite. That is that Senator Dean Smith wrote a letter to our government lobbying for the release from detention of a convicted child sex offender. This is a remarkable thing to have done. A person who has reached a position of power in this parliament chose to use that position of power to advocate for a child sex offender.</span>

I want people to remember that as they listen to the debate over the coming days, because the truth is that there is one side of politics here that is trying to do the right thing and adapt to the High Court change and do so in the interests of the community and another side of politics that's being hypocritical and just trying to score political points. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Under Labor net disposable income has fallen by more than five per cent and interest rates have gone up 12 times. Our inflation is home grown, and we now have one of the highest and most persistent inflation rates of any advanced country. Why is this distracted Prime Minister making Australians worse off with his bad decisions and wrong priorities?</span>

It is a question that goes to the fact that unemployment is at historic lows, the participation rate is at a record high, the gender pay gap, as I said before, is at a record low, the number of women employed full-time is at a record high, business investment is up, the number of days lost to industrial disputes is down, the number of single mums getting support is up, the cost of child care is down, Commonwealth rental assistance is up, and the cost of medicine is down. All of this has been achieved without any support for any of these measures from those opposite. And, most importantly, over 620,000 jobs have been created since we came to office—the most for any new government in Australia's history, and we are halfway through. Importantly as well, we've seen two consecutive quarters of real wages growth.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Scullin</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:16</span>):  I thank my friend the member for Cunningham, who, like all of us on this side of the House, is determined to do everything she can in this place to keep communities safe. I'm sure she joins me in thanking the outstanding members of the Australian Border Force and the Australian Federal Police, who have been working so hard with state and territory authorities to ensure community safety.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said earlier, yesterday this House passed legislation to make strong laws stronger following the High Court's decision in the NZYQ case. As we consider the court's reasons for the decision, we are getting on with the job of doing all we can to keep communities safe—including by introducing new offence provisions which target those visa holders who have offences that relate to children and young people. Yesterday, members opposite voted against these laws not once but twice. That is an approach that we reject.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the same day, the Leader of the Opposition was silent about Liberal frontbencher Senator Smith's request for a convicted paedophile to be released from detention on Christmas Island. Senator Smith wrote: 'After developing a relationship with a younger girl, he was convicted in 2015 of sexual penetration with a girl over the age of 13 and under the age of 16.' That's a quote. The frontbencher went on to ask that he be transferred from Christmas Island. Senator Smith acknowledged the seriousness of this man's offending, as we all must, but still requested he be released into the community anyway.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The question really is this: how can the Leader of the Opposition stand by a member of his leadership team calling for a paedophile to be released? In the past he has called for members of parliament to resign for the very same thing! He has said, and I quote him now, 'Why would a member of parliament defend anyone who has been convicted of paedophilia?' Yet a member of his leadership team has done exactly the same thing. Once again, he talks tough but acts weak. Back in 2018, when he was the minister responsible for immigration detention, media reports indicate that detainees at immigration detention centres escaped more than 80 times. Once again, he talks tough and he acts weak. In his two decades in public life, he has contributed nothing positive other than talking himself up—full of bluff and bluster, signifying absolutely nothing. This issue is a test of his words. He should stick to his words and agree that Senator Smith's letters are unacceptable, in which case his position is unacceptable, or his silence must be taken as an endorsement.</span>

Riding on a kayak around Newcastle harbour doesn't do that; policy does that. The policy of this government does that. Creating the jobs of the future for the Hunter does that. Creating green-energy jobs like the hydrogen hub for the Newcastle port, which we have announced and implemented, is what reduces emissions and creates jobs for the people of the Hunter.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The people of the Hunter know that the jobs of the future are clean-energy jobs. They know that they are jobs related to green hydrogen and offshore wind. They are the jobs that are related to creating energy not just for Australia but for our region and exporting that energy. That's what this government is getting on with the job of doing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are also managing a complicated transition. I've got to say, if I was a member of the Greens, I would not have chosen today to ask this government a question about new gas. I would have made a different judgement call because yesterday the Greens voted with One Nation, Senator Babet and Senator Canavan to overturn the code of conduct which requires any new gas to be sent to the domestic market. The Greens have previously had a New South Wales member call for the code of conduct. A Greens MP called Sue Higginson called for the code of conduct and said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Any guarantee that Australian gas will be reserved for domestic use must come with price caps that ensure our domestic supply prices are not being driven by energy profiteering following armed conflict around the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's what the gas code which they just tried to overturn does. They voted to overturn the gas code, the bit of regulation of the gas industry. They talk tough and say they're anti gas. We bring down a regulation to actually anchor prices and to ensure that domestic supply—not international supply—is secured, and they try and overturn it. They go out with their mates, the new coalition of craziness: One Nation and the Greens! You couldn't make this stuff up. You really couldn't make it up.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll tell you what: the Greens embark in slogans and protest; we embark in policy and progress. That's what we are delivering: jobs for the future for the people of the Hunter and emissions down, driven by the great energy regions of Australia, including the Hunter, the Illawarra, Gippsland and so many others. That's what good policy does. It engineers this most massive economic transformation. That's what this government is leading. The Greens can engage in protest and they can vote with One Nation, Senator Babet and Senator Canavan on their silly little stunts. We'll be getting on with the job.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia right now is grappling with a new public health menace. Vaping right around the world was sold to communities as a therapeutic good that would help hardened smokers kick the habit when they'd tried a whole range of other smoking cessation supports with no success, but it's now clear we were all deliberately deceived. It is now beyond doubt that this is a product that is being deliberately targeted at recruiting a new generation—our youngest generation—to nicotine addiction. You just have to look at these products. They're brightly coloured. They have cartoon figures on them—pink unicorns and things like that. There are bubblegum flavours. They're often marketed as highlighter pens and USBs so students can hide them in their pencil cases without being detected by teachers and their parents.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Most tragically, this deliberate strategy from the tobacco industry is working. One in six high-school kids is vaping, and one in four young adults is vaping. Over the course of the recent exam period, year 11s and year 12s have had to wear nicotine patches to get through an exam without having a vape. We know this is now, as the education minister tells me all the time, the No. 1 behavioural issue in our school communities that parents, teachers and school leaders talk about.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also know that young vapers are three times more likely to take up cigarettes, and our youngest Australians are now the only cohort in the community in which smoking rates are going up. Some in the community say: 'It's gone too far. We should just raise the white flag, accept that this is now part of the Australian way of life and maybe derive a bit of revenue from it on the way.' That is the position of the National Party and some others in the coalition party room, I think to their discredit. That is why Greg Hunt was rolled by the coalition party room when he tried to snuff this out at the start and put in place an import control.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is not the approach of this government. We're not going to give in to this deliberate, cynical strategy by the tobacco industry to undo five decades of tobacco control efforts. We'll do what the former government should have done. On 1 January it will be illegal to import any disposable vapes into this country. Over the course of the following months we'll put in place more regulation to ensure that our kids are protected and that the ABF and TGA are properly resourced. We'll snuff this out for good. <span style="font-style:italic;">(T</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ime expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grayndler</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Prime Minister</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:26</span>):  Last night at the Australian War Memorial I had the privilege of attending a dinner commemorating the sinking of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Montevideo </span><span style="font-style:italic;">M</span><span style="font-style:italic;">aru</span> on 1 July 1942. After that event, which was attended by the Chief of Army and the Chief of Navy, I had a discussion with the shadow minister for defence about raising it here in parliament today, because I really think that this is a story that needs greater reflection and knowledge amongst the Australian people, paying respect to the almost 1,000 Australians who perished in what was our nation's worst ever maritime disaster. Last night, on every table, were family members honouring their loved ones and signifying the long vigil they have kept in service of their memories.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The <span style="font-style:italic;">Montevideo Maru</span> was a Japanese vessel known as a hell ship, carrying prisoners of war in horrendous confinement. It was unmarked as a prison transport and was torpedoed by the USS<span style="font-style:italic;"> Sturgeon</span><span style="font-style:italic;">,</span> which was not aware that the <span style="font-style:italic;">Montevideo Maru</span> was carrying allied prisoners of war. It sank in 11 minutes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Think about this figure: more Australian soldiers died in those 11 minutes than in the entirety of the Vietnam War—in 11 minutes. Remarkably, it was not until Anzac Day this year that, through the work of the Silentworld Foundation, the final resting place of those lost souls was known at last. It was, literally, a remarkable find. It was at a depth of nearly 4,200 metres, deeper than the wreck of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Titanic</span>.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australians lost to the sea that day were a mixture of interned civilians who'd made a home in Rabaul in New Guinea and soldiers from Lark Force who had been garrisoned there in 1941 and taken as prisoners of war when the Japanese invasion came in January 1942. All were malnourished and many gravely ill, captive in some of the most brutal conditions imaginable. Yet in their final letters home their only thoughts were for those at home, providing words of reassurance and hope, love and comfort:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">These letters, showing that great Australian spirit, were written by factory workers and farmhands, sporting stars and members of the Salvation Army band.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We heard last night there were relatives, three brothers, who all perished at the same time. It's quite extraordinary. They were mainly from Victoria, but from Western Australia, from Claremont, from Middle Park, from Traralgon, from a range of areas right around Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These letters were sent home, and, of course, the relatives didn't know what had happened to them. It was a long, long time away until, in October 1945, official telegrams informed families their loved ones became missing on 1 July 1942 and were presumed dead.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The final story belongs to the last living member of the Japanese crew, and the Japanese ambassador joined us there last night, along with other members of the diplomatic corps. Sixty years after that fateful day, he spoke of how, as the ship sank, groups of Australians clinging to pieces of wreckage in the water sang Auld Lang Syne for their brothers already below. Until the end, their thoughts were of others.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last night was one of those nights that, as public officeholders, we have the great privilege of seeing the best of Australia. There was a video shown of the oldest survivor, who is 103—who wanted to come, but was unfortunately unable to. But the video that has been done of it is quite remarkable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To John Mullen in particular—the work that he has done is quite remarkable; it makes a difference to all of these families. To the Australian War Memorial—it is a sacred site in this country, and there was nowhere better to have what was a commemoration but also a celebration last night. Today, we, as a parliament, show that we have not forgotten those on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Montevideo Maru</span>. We bring them to mind. We honour them. As we say: We will remember them. Lest we forget.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canning</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:32</span>):  on indulgence—I was very glad to represent the Leader of the Opposition last night at the Silentworld Foundation dinner at the Australian War Memorial. Prime Minister, thank you for the opportunity to speak today, because this is special to my family.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was a special night for all the families of the more than 1,000 Australian prisoners of war lost in Philippine waters aboard the SS <span style="font-style:italic;">Montevideo Maru</span> on 1 July 1942, the worst maritime loss of life in Australian history. Many families were shattered by the loss of loved ones, the grief passing through the generations. Yet, after more than 80 years, the final resting place of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Montevideo</span> was found this year on 18 April at a depth of over 4,000 metres, deeper than that of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Titanic</span>. The final resting place of so many Australians thought to be known only to God was revealed at last to the relief of many families.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last night, while sombre, was also a time for celebration, as the Prime Minister has noted, a time to celebrate that those once lost are now found. And on behalf of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Montevideo</span> families, I thank the Silentworld Foundation team, led very ably by John and Jacqui Mullen, explorers of the deep who made it their mission to find our lost family and friends. We honour the team who went to sea, partnering with Fugro and the Australian Department of Defence. What seemed impossible—locating a lost ship at such depth—they made possible, and we thank them for it. We also thank Andrea Williams, chair of the Rabaul and <span style="font-style:italic;">Montevideo Meru</span> group, for her tireless advocacy on behalf of the families.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to make two final points. The tragedy of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Montevideo Maru</span> reminds us how costly war can be. The sinking of the ship was shrouded in the fog of war, as the Japanese flagged <span style="font-style:italic;">Montevideo</span> was sunk by the USS <span style="font-style:italic;">Sturgeon</span> with its final war shot after embarking on patrol from Fremantle in Western Australia. The USS <span style="font-style:italic;">Sturgeon</span> was defending Australia during its darkest hour in 1942. Our loss reminds us that peace is something to be protected, which is why we welcome, once again, the presence of US submarines in Western Australia from 2027. Peace through strength is how we avoid a repeat of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Montevideo</span> tragedy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Montevideo Maru</span> has touched members of this House. Our former Prime Minister, Earle Page, lost his brother, Harold Page, the then deputy administrator of Papua New Guinea. Kim Beazley lost his uncle, the Reverend Syd Beazley, of the Methodist mission. Peter Garrett lost his grandfather, Tom Garrett. I lost my great-uncle, Private Neill Ross Callaghan, who perished with his brother-in-law, James Walker, leaving behind his young beautiful widow, Nell, who felt the hammer blow of double bereavement—left to mourn the loss of her husband and brother. I grew up sensing the sadness in my grandparents whenever Uncle Neill's name was mentioned. For this reason, I am grateful for the opportunity to speak to the House and honour our fallen as well as the great team at Silentworld, who, in a sense, have returned them to us. Lest we forget.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="R36" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ALBANESE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grayndler</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Prime Minister</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:35</span>):  At today's caucus meeting, Senator Patrick Dodson returned. Senator Patrick Dodson has undergone a long period of treatment for cancer in Perth from his Broome home. He informed me some time ago that he wanted to come back to parliament to pay his respects for his election, and it says a lot about his integrity that he has made the effort to make the trip to Canberra even though his health issues are ongoing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Dodson told me a while ago of his plan to retire from the Senate, and that fills me with sadness but also with a sense of gratitude. Patrick Dodson is a great Yawuru man, a wonderful Australian and such a great human being. You'd gladly follow him into battle, and I have. Yet he has made his life's work to make peace. From the moment he entered parliament, he has made this place a better one. As a boy, he hid in the long grass while the police and welfare officers took his mates. Yet, despite what must have been such an incredibly traumatic experience as a child—one that is almost incomprehensible—he grew into the father of reconciliation, a figure of grace, dignity and inspiration. He has spent his life championing justice and advancing reconciliation—a commissioner into Aboriginal deaths in custody, the first chair of Reconciliation Australia, a director of the Central Land Council and the Kimberley Land Council. He has shone a spotlight on the gaping chasm in outcomes between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. He put forward solutions grounded in policy reform. He also, as always, sought to call attention to the deep connection that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people share with the land and waters and the incredible contribution they've made to national life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Someone with Patrick's record of service would have been more than entitled to spend his late 60s and early 70s on one of those beautiful beaches in Broome. It's a measure of the man and a reflection of his commitment to our nation and to what he calls 'unfinished business' that he chose to serve Australia in the Senate. It has been my great fortune to be able to count Senator Dodson as a colleague and my enduring happiness to be able to count on him as a friend. I've benefitted time and time again from his wise counsel, and he has taught me so much over the years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Patrick is a generous man. Through his seven years, he has gifted every member of our caucus and people across the parliament his wisdom, his courage, his fearless conviction and his eternal good humour. Through the powerful example of his own life, he has given so many of us the gift of a greater sense of perspective. There are few more reassuring sights in this building than that of Patrick and his hat coming down a corridor towards you. When you're in Pat's presence, you often laugh, you always learn, and you feel yourself stand taller.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On behalf of the Labor family that he gained when he became a senator for Western Australia, I give credit to Bill Shorten for the decision that he made to bring Patrick into the Senate and into the Labor fold. I wish Pat all the very best as he quite rightly focuses on his own health. He will leave parliament in January. He leaves parliament with our thanks, with our love and most importantly, I think, with our total respect.</span>

We send our love to his family and to those who are closest to him. We pay respect to the contribution that he's made to the Senate and the contribution that he's made over many decades, as the Prime Minister rightly points out, to many Australians, particularly those of Indigenous heritage. He's a person who is genuine and absolute in his desire to see a better outcome for Indigenous Australians, and in many ways, wearing many hats, he's been able to deliver that. He should be rightly proud of the contribution that he's made to our nation. He's provided an inspiration to generations of young Indigenous people and provided support to their own advancement through their careers. It is a difficult battle—there's no question about that—and I hope that he hears our words of support for him in the pain that he is suffering at the moment and that his family and those who love him most are experiencing as well. We thank him for his service in the Senate and wish him all the very best for the future.</span>

Every week—in fact, every question time—brings more chaos and dysfunction from this distracted and chaotic government. Today was a really good example. We had the hapless immigration minister acknowledging that he has lost hardened criminals on the streets after previously inviting them to be case-managed by his department; the hopeless home affairs minister, sent up day after day to try and back him in; and the obfuscating Prime Minister, who just doesn't have the courage to give a straight answer to the question, 'Why did you not defend our Australian sailors from an attack by the Chinese navy by demonstrating that you back them in when you had a chance with the Chinese President?' They are obfuscating every single day. It's minister after minister. I can't even begin on the environment and water minister, or I don't know what will happen for the rest of this MPI. But she has single-handedly traded off the lives and livelihoods of the farmers and food and fibre producers in the Murray-Darling Basin without ever having the courage to look them in the eye and tell them what she really has in store for them.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, poll after poll demonstrates that Australians feel like they're worse off today than when the Labor Party was elected 18 months ago. As they pass the halfway mark of this government, they can see what life is like under this Prime Minister. They're not liking what they're seeing. They're seeing a distracted and chaotic government, and a prime minister who goes missing in action when it matters most. We know these overseas trips are important; of course we do. But we also know the look of glee on the Prime Minister's face as he steps once more onto the red carpet and once more into his dedicated VIP aircraft and leaves the country.</span>

Sixty per cent are going hungry, and they are employed. You only have to visit these food charities to see the pain on their faces.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Ms LEY:</span>
                  </a>  That's right, Member for Barker. We have a growing class of working poor. Breadlines are appearing in our cities once again. In the 2020s, like the 1920s, Australia is looking less like the lucky country and more like the hungry country—such a far cry from what the Prime Minister promised: 'No-one left behind, always looking after the disadvantaged and vulnerable; that's what my government will do.' Well, millions and millions of Australians are being left behind. As I said, you visit these food charities, as we all do, and you're told how they see an immediate spike in presentations once mortgages go up. And, unfortunately, mortgages may be going up further, with the Reserve Bank governor confirming that Australia has world-leading inflation, driven not by overseas factors but by domestic factors. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It isn't just mortgages that are biting. Labor is hammering Australians on every front. Food is up eight per cent; housing, up 10 per cent; insurance, up 17 per cent; electricity, up 18 per cent; and gas, up 28 per cent. From rents to retail, inflation is due to Labor's reckless decision to bring in hundreds of thousands of migrants without a plan to house them. The services Australians need cost more today because of rises in electricity and rents. They're all things that Labor has done by driving up inflation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I didn't mention the preposterous energy minister—that's the only description I have for him in every single question time—and the ridiculous statements he makes, because what he doesn't understand is what we see in the manufacturing businesses of Australia: hurt, pain, doors closing, employees being let go and no prospect of actually making things in Australia, as the Labor government wants us to do. It's really no surprise that prices are surging. From the cost of building your first home to your morning coffee, food in the supermarket and even your Uber trip, Labor are fixated on driving up prices exactly when we need them to do the opposite.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We can't let this MPI go past without talking about national security, because we shouldn't forget it took President Biden and ASIO director Mike Burgess to remind Australians of the threats posed by China—by the Chinese Communist Party—when the Prime Minister failed to do so. He used to talk tough on Chinese ownership of the port of Darwin, but he opted for the status quo. He reassured us his rapprochement with China was just about business, but his officials told the diaspora community that his visit to Beijing was purely political. And disgracefully, after his government stage-managed the release of information to avoid awkward questions about this attack on our Navy divers, he still refuses to confirm whether or not he stood up for our people when he met President Xi Jinping. It cannot be the case that we have a prime minister who speaks up for Aussie pandas when he's in China—happy to be photographed with the pandas—but refuses to speak up for our Navy divers. The government claims to be kicking goals in foreign policy, but all I can see is chaos.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The chaos on our borders has really been writ large in the parliament over the last fortnight because Labor have released over 100 hardened criminals into the community and now we've learnt that they can't account for them. The minister for immigration has promised me a list. The minister for immigration promised me a list of how many rapists, murderers and paedophiles he has released.</span>

                  </a>  No, I haven't got it, even though he said he would do that on 14 November. He told me he would provide me with a list. Under Labor, we now have new asylum seekers arriving by boat being put into Nauru, with the first child going into detention since Labor was last in government. Weak on borders, weak on defence, weak on foreign policy—Labor are proving an Australian political truism: when given enough rope, they are economic and national security failures. It is chaos.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">If you're bewildered about how we got here, remember what the Prime Minister's sole focus was for his first 500 days in office. His first and total focus was the Voice. He doesn't mention it now. He took the Voice referendum from a 61-39 majority to the bottom of the cliff, 61-39 against. He killed constitutional recognition of Indigenous Australians for at least a generation. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He is tricky and slippery with the truth. This may seem like a small thing but, my goodness, it's indicative. Just last week, he tried to claim that he hadn't had any time off for a year, but he actually announced to the media in April that he was going on a week's leave. He told an audience, 'I haven't had any time off.' He said, 'I don't talk about private meetings with world leaders,' but then he briefed out what he discussed with President Biden in October. 'I don't talk about the National Security Committee.' He has said that many times. Well, time after time he likes to talk about the National Security Committee. He likes to mislead. Unfortunately, he peddles mistruths when it suits him. The consequences are clear for all of us to see.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today the excellent, outstanding shadow minister for communications brought a bill into this place about an online safety amendment to protect Australian children from online harm, and this government voted against it. Shame on them. Do we really think that it's okay to ignore the eSafety Commissioner? She is a really good person who spent two years researching the issue of online harm to children and came up with what I think is quite a moderate proposal, which is to do a trial about age verification, to try to restrict access by younger children to violent pornography online. Why would you not support that? I encourage everyone to listen to the words of the shadow minister for communications and others who spoke in that debate, including the crossbench. There was a very powerful intervention from the member for Mayo, and others on the crossbench were saying, 'What on earth is wrong with the government that it wouldn't support this?' That's it, you see, Deputy Speaker. Every single day— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Dr ALY:</span>
                  </a>  He talked about that great Labor leader Bill Hayden and spoke about how Bill Hayden said that, in government, actions speak louder than words. So I really want to thank those opposite for bringing this matter of public importance to parliament today, because it gives us all on this side the opportunity to talk about the actions that our government has taken. As we wind up the year and as we come to the halfway point of our first term in government, we can look at our track record and talk about the actions that our government has taken that have made a real difference to Australians' lives during some really difficult times and which are helping us to navigate the country through some tough economic times, with some tough global headwinds.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When we took office, we hit the ground running and went straight to work to implement the policies that we took to the election, with an understanding that those policies would make a tangible difference to the lives of Australians. We know that a lot of people are doing it tough. I've been here since 2016 and have stood up time and time again and talked about the people in my electorate—people who live in Balga, Mirrabooka, Girrawheen, Marangaroo, Koondoola, Lockridge, Kiara—who have been doing it tough. I've listened to my colleagues on this side of the House. In the time that I've been in here, we have not stopped standing up on behalf of the people in our electorates who we know have been doing it tough. That's why we've had sensible and targeted measures to ensure that the most vulnerable people in our communities right across Australia are getting the support that they need.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to talk about the portfolio that I represent in early childhood education and care. As just one example of a commitment that we took to the election and something that we've delivered on that actually has made a tangible difference, putting real money back into the pockets of Australians, when we increased the childcare subsidy the effect was to slash the cost of early childhood education and care for around 1.2 million families right across the nation. This was, as I mentioned, a commitment that we took to the election.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The latest ABS consumer price index report showed that that policy, our cheaper childcare legislation, improved the costs of early learning by around 13.2 per cent. That's on average. In fact, the ABS estimates that without the changes to the childcare subsidy—changes that we took to the election and that we delivered on in our first year in government—childcare costs for families would have increased by 6.7 per cent. Now, all major cities across Australia have seen childcare costs for families drop by at least 10 per cent, with some having seen a reduction of more than 17 per cent. So there have been reductions of between 10 and 17 per cent—on average, 13.2 per cent. Compare that to if we had done nothing, as those opposite wanted us to. Remember that they said that an increase to the childcare subsidy was unnecessary. If we had done what they wanted us to do, which was nothing, the out-of-pocket costs of early childhood education and care for families across Australia would have increased by 6.7 per cent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not just the ABS data that shows how those opposite completely failed when it comes to the cost of living and the impact of the cost of early childhood education on that. The latest ACCC report, an interim report that we commissioned, showed that under the former government early childhood education and care costs went up by twice as much as the OECD average. If you think that that is not a cost-of-living issue, think again. Those of us in the House here, as well as people up in the gallery and people watching from home who have sat around the family table and talked about their budget, know that the first thing you factor in is the cost of early childhood education and care. That's the first thing you factor in. Then you start to look at what else you can fit around that when you're deciding who's going to work, how many hours they're going to work and what you're going to be able to afford.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Make no mistake, these are changes that are possible only when Australia has a Labor government. A Labor government is a government where actions speak louder than words, a government that is dedicated to more than just media announcements and a government that is dedicated to actually delivering on the things that we take to elections and the promises that we make to Australians to look after their best interests. The great legacy of Labor governments past includes the introduction of Medicare, the protection of Medicare and the introduction of the single mothers pension, which, as the Prime Minister mentioned earlier today, was a legacy of Bill Hayden. It's something that I've benefited from as a single mum trying to raise two children on her own. These are reforms that are always brought in by Labor governments and that always help the most vulnerable in our country, and this government builds on those reforms.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since we took office, we have seen policies to reduce the pressure of the cost of living on families, including: providing electricity bill relief; making medicines cheaper; making it easier and cheaper to see a doctor; building more social and affordable homes; increasing rent assistance; introducing the Help to Buy Scheme, which will support 40,000 Australians into homeownership; providing fee-free TAFE; and seeing real wages rising at the fastest rate in a decade, including the minimum wage and the wages of aged-care workers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And when we increased the minimum wage, when we changed the industrial relations legislation to see the poorest-paid workers in Australia get a lift in their wages, did the sky fall down, as those opposite said it would? Did the weekend end? I don't know about you all, but I think the weekend is still here. We've done all this in the face of and despite the naysayers opposite, who argued that every step we took to reduce cost-of-living pressures on families was going to ruin the nation somehow or other.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the results are real and tangible: real wages up, gender pay gap down, women's workforce participation up, unemployment down, cost of early childhood education and care down, cost of seeing a doctor down, business investment up, minimum wage up—all these in our first 18 months, all these because we delivered on the key commitments that we took to an election and that Australians voted for, all this despite an opposition that says no to everything and despite the fact that we inherited a mess and had a lot to fix up.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have not wavered from our primary focus on cost of living, on wages, on jobs, on building a stronger economy for all Australians, and we will not waver from that primary focus. We've already achieved a lot in our first 18 months, but we acknowledge that there is a lot more to do. And the Albanese government isn't wasting a day in moving on cost of living and those things we see as important to our economy and to the everyday Australians we represent. Our government is ambitious. Our government is laying the foundations for a stronger Australia, not just now but into the future.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moncrieff</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:02</span>):  This Labor government is in chaos. It's like a summer cyclone after 18 months of wind. It's culminated into a cost-of-living crisis, and the economy is in the low of the storm. Labor's waters are breaching national security and Australians who rely on their government to keep them safe in their communities are drowning. This government has failed on the economy. The cost of living is going through the roof and families cannot afford to hold it together. Inflation under Labor has been higher for longer, causing interest rates to be higher, inflicting pain on Australian families. This government has spent $188 billion keeping inflation higher for longer. And especially at Christmas, when families want to celebrate together and want to spend extra money on groceries, want to spend extra money on celebrating togetherness, alas, under this Albanese Labor government 50 per cent of Australians say they are worse off this year and their pay packets don't go as far as they did last year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Electricity costs under this government are up by 18 per cent. Where's the $275 the Prime Minister promised? He promised Australians $275 off their electricity bill, but under this government electricity is up by 18 per cent. And gas: if you want to cook on your gas cooker—I've got one at home—prices are up by 28 per cent. That's expensive. And unaffordable rents are due to high interest rates, because landlords pay those interest rates—due to this government keeping inflation higher for longer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They are distracted. They have been distracted on what matters most to Australians, which is the economy. They have been distracted by the Prime Minister's $450 million referendum that failed. The Prime Minister paid $450 million for Australians to categorically tell him they will not be divided on race. What a waste of money.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has spent $4.7 billion on increasing the childcare subsidy without one new place in regional and remote Australia. They may have helped some families, but there are families who still cannot access early childhood education and care. Families are languishing on waiting lists everywhere, all over the country. Those families who can't work can't pay the bills. This is all under the Albanese Labor government, 18 months in. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister's been distracted by his flight times, and he has dropped his boarding pass a few times now. He has dropped his boarding pass on national security. Ten boats have attempted to come to our shores. It is a disgrace. His immigration minister and his home affairs minister are patting each other on the back during question time on what a great job they've done, but it's now costing taxpayers $255 million to boost community safety for their failure. We have over 100 hardened criminals now out in our community. One of them we don't know where they are. We don't know where that criminal is thanks to this government. Thanks to this government, Australians have to lock their doors this Christmas. Australians, you have to watch your children very closely this Christmas thanks to this government letting paedophiles out onto the street. You have to tighten your belts and you have to batten down the hatches for another year under the cyclone that is this Labor government. They are failing Australians where they should not be—failing on the economy, failing on national security and failing on community safety, which is the primary role of governments. It's to look after Australian citizens. Shame on you!</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fraser</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:07</span>):  When I saw in this motion the phrases 'chaotic government' and 'Prime Minister missing in action' it occurred to me: 'Maybe the opposition has finally undertaken some introspection after the last election. Maybe they're going to come in here and we're going to hear a big mea culpa for the decade of mess that we inherited.' But, unfortunately, after the last 15 minutes of rhetoric, I see that is not to be the case.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's look at that phrase 'chaotic government'. How about three leaders in quick succession, with each change ever more acrimonious? How about countless ministers, a turnstile of ministers, in key portfolios? How about productivity across the economy at 60-year lows? Not since the Great Depression had we had an economy perform so badly. How about no skills agreement for their whole term? How about no skills investment? How about taking funds out of our TAFE system? How about denialism on climate change which was embarrassing on the international stage and meant that we couldn't get into a range of international discussions? We couldn't even get a seat at the table. But, even more than that, it means we're starting the task of climate change abatement 10 years after we should have, which is going to make it all the harder. We didn't know exactly when the next massive disruption to our economy would come. We didn't know exactly when the next pandemic would occur. But we knew there would be one at some point. What happened is that, when COVID came, our economy was all the more ill prepared for it. We had low productivity growth, we had low investment in supply chains and we had low investment in skills. It was made all the harder because of a decade of poor government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When they want to talk about chaotic government, those opposite should have a good, hard look in the mirror. When the Australian people, at the last election, made a judgement on what a chaotic government is, they made a very clear judgement. Let's look at a couple of the key issues at the last election and what constitutes chaotic government. What about good decision-making? What about dealing with corruption in government? What about having institutions that strengthen our democracy and strengthen the public's faith in democracy?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite had years to put in place a national anticorruption commission. They promised time and time again it was coming: 'It's coming. It's going to come by this date. It's going to come by that date.' Then, towards the end of their hopeless 10 years in government, they had a bill that was outside of government and started to blame us, the opposition; they wouldn't introduce the bill because they wanted a guarantee from us that we would pass their poorly designed institution. It was so chaotic and poor that we had no action on that core issue for so long, and it became a major issue at the election and a major reason why that previous government was thrown out. We have instituted a strong, robust national anticorruption commission in our first 18 months in government, and it represents action on so many fronts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What about <span style="font-style:italic;">Respect@Work</span>? Those opposite received the recommendations from that report but didn't implement key recommendations. It took the change of government for key recommendations to be implemented. What about climate change? I talked about a decade of denial on climate change, a decade of chaos, with 27 policies on climate change. In our first 18 months we've legislated net zero, we've legislated a 43 per cent reduction by 2030, we've put in place a safeguard mechanism—step after step, taking us down the path we need to get to. It's starting from a point we didn't need to start from but we're taking all the steps we need to.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What about the economy and cost of living? Those opposite had this shocking performance when it came to productivity, which put us in a very poor position when COVID hit. Under their watch, we had the highest single quarter of inflation growth. We've seen, under our term in government, in 18 months, inflation come down materially—it's got further to come down but it has come down materially—and we've seen unemployment resilient and seen the labour market resilient. The unemployment rate remains with a '3' in front of it. We've seen the participation rate at record levels. We're seeing inflation coming down but we are managing to walk that narrow path where we are seeing the labour market remain resilient. That's helping people to continue to stay in the labour market, which is helping them to pay their mortgages and helping them to navigate these difficult times.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to cost-of-living pressures on the most vulnerable households, there are a lot of households doing it tough. Our government is doing targeted cost-of-living assistance, the 10-point plan—cheaper medicines, rent assistance, child care; the list goes on—and we're doing it in a way where we're not making the Reserve Bank's job harder. We are investing in productivity in the long run—skills, climate change and many other areas. Chaos was what he had until the last election. It's the opposite that we have now.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gippsland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:12</span>):  I'm sorry the Prime Minister is not here for the matter of public importance because, as you know, Deputy Speaker Claydon, I'm here to help. I don't want to be a dobber—no-one likes being a dobber—but he needs to know what's been going on as he travels the world. I've been watching those opposite very closely in the last two question times, and, I've got to say, it has been like watching a funeral procession over the last couple of days. The PM was at the dispatch box delivering his big zingers, and there's been a deathly silence amongst those opposite. They've got their heads down. They're looking at their mobile phones, all checking the latest Newspoll results, trying to figure out if they can win with a primary vote that is lower than it was at the last election: 'Can I still win? Is my great career going to end now?' I've seen this tragedy unfold before. Very soon they will start looking around the caucus room: 'Who can boost my chances? Who can invest in my greatness? Who can make me what I should be?' Let me assure you all: someone is ready for that tap on the shoulder. The ever-ambitious member for Rankin is already out there choosing the curtain colours at the Lodge. He's ready to tear down those Rabbitohs posters and insert his own Brisbane Broncos posters at the Lodge. The lad from Logan City is in a hurry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've been reading a bit lately, and I was taken by that very famous quote by Shakespeare's <span style="font-style:italic;">The Tragedy of Julius Caesar</span>. At one point Caesar ponders:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Yond Cassius has a lean and hungry look; He thinks too much: such men are dangerous.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then I read another piece—not quite Shakespeare but comedy and tragedy in equal measure. It was the 5,699-word puff piece on the Treasurer written by Deborah Snow. I'm not sure 'Deborah Snow' is not a pseudonym for Jim Chalmers, actually. It was glorious coverage of his fabulous fitness regime, his intellectualism and his good humour. It was 5,699 words of gushing praise. I was running around the lake this morning and I half expected to see the Treasurer walking across the lake, because it was such a stunning piece. But I was struck by this quote from the Treasurer in this gushing piece of fluff:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">You know, every career has an arc and I like reading about how people think about the end of the arc.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Prime Minister, a word to the wise: he thinks too much. Such men are dangerous.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While the Labor Party have started plotting and scheming behind the scenes, they've already forgotten the people they were elected to represent in the first place. This Prime Minister said he would govern for all Australians. Tell that to the timber workers in my electorate of Gippsland and tell that to the irrigation communities within the Murray-Darling Basin, because this government and this Prime Minister are about to waste $22 billion of taxpayers' money buying back water from productive agricultural use. It is a plan that will force up the price of groceries for Australian families in the middle of a cost-of-living crisis. What genius could ever support an idea that would involve forcing up grocery prices and making it harder to produce food in the nation's food bowl in the middle of a cost-of-living crisis? I can understand, though, why those opposite don't understand the Murray-Darling Basin, because none of them live in the Murray Darling Basin.</span>

So more than $20 billion of taxpayers' money is to be wasted to increase the cost of living.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me just talk about one other thing which reflects on this Prime Minister and his distraction from the issues which impact regional people. The issues that regional people are talking about are their jobs, the cost of living, good roads, good schools and health services. They're talking about things that matter in their lives while the Prime Minister is out there wasting more than $400 million on his vanity project, dividing the nation with his failed Voice proposal. It just demonstrates again the poor judgement and just how out of touch the Prime Minister is, and it's a reflection on the distraction and disengagement he has. He spends most of his time overseas, and I just say to the Prime Minister: get back in the country and do your day job, because I tell you now, Prime Minister, that, if you don't start understanding the issues that are impacting regional people and start keeping your promise to govern for all Australians, you need to realise that the Treasurer is very happy to do that job for you.</span>

The defence minister was representing the Australian government in Saudi Arabia. He and the Prime Minister and the foreign minister are working hard to restore our place in the world while delivering for Australians here at home. The assistant ministers were already committed to other events in other states too, because they were busy delivering for all Australians. Just on Thursday, Minister Conroy announced that Henderson would become the home of continuous naval shipbuilding in Western Australia, which the WA state Minister for Defence Industry, the Hon. Paul Papalia, described quite rightly as an 'absolutely priceless' decision. That's what this government does: it makes good decisions and gets on with business.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A few days before that, I attended the BP refinery site in Kwinana in the electorate of Brand, together with Ministers Bowen and Madeleine King, for the announcement of the H2Kwinana hydrogen energy hub. The Albanese government is investing over half a billion dollars in regional hydrogen hubs, with the other locations being the Pilbara, Gladstone, Townsville, the Hunter, Bell Bay and Port Bonython. It's important, as it has been predicted that our hydrogen industry will generate anything up to $50 billion in additional GDP by 2050. We have had interest in this from all over the world, and the government would be negligent not to take action. This government takes action. We recently delivered the gas code and expanded the Capacity Investment Scheme because governments have to plan for the future and the future is calling.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Earlier this month, I attended the CSIRO labs in Perth. We can be very proud of our CSIRO, which has originated many essential innovations such as polymer banknotes, long-life contact lenses and wi-fi. It's important that we value the CSIRO and Australian ingenuity and back it in here at home. I will only briefly remind members that the climate science division of CSIRO was gutted by the coalition in 2016—a great example of how not to treat our scientists and how not to govern our country. The coalition is chaos.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In science and technology we see that the lack of action over the last 10 years has now been corrected by this government. Where were the AI strategy, the quantum strategy and the robotics strategy under the too many long years under Liberal-National coalition as they sleepwalked into the future? Under this government it is all happening. The Albanese government has been characterised by stability and delivery. We have delivered the <span style="font-style:italic;">Defence strategic review</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> 2023</span>. Where was your Defence strategic review? We've created Australia's first national anticorruption commission. Where was your legislation? We've re-established ties with our Pacific neighbours. All you could do was insult them. We have delivered two surpluses in two budgets with targeted relief for Australian households. We're closing the gender pay gap, we've increased women's participation in the workforce and this is the first gender-representative governing party in our history. Where's the coalition? We are taking action on climate change, securing our energy supply and renewing our environmental legislation—things the Liberal and National parties could never do, because they could never agree on the science. It was chaos.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've got wages moving again, which was not a priority for those opposite. We've invested in Medicare. We've increased bulk-billing and made medicines cheaper. Those opposite did not. We've increased assistance payments, parenting payments and rent assistance at a time when household budgets do need a hand. We've increased enrolments in training with fee-free TAFE. We are changing lives. We've acted to uncover wrongdoings such as the robodebt scandal and the Pricewaterhouse scandal. We're strengthening the Public Service and implementing the recommendations of the Jenkins review to create a safe and respectful workplace. We have repaired relations with our trading partners and finalised trade agreements that have stalled. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs McINTOSH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lindsay</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:22</span>):  Australians have had enough. After 18 months of this chaotic and distracted Prime Minister and the Albanese Labor government, the public want better. He's missing in action, glitzing around on the world stage while there are issues at home that the Australian public want action on right now. He's missing in action on the cost-of-living crisis, which is gripping every single household in my electorate of Lindsay. From Emu Heights and Leonay to Colyton and North St Marys, not one suburb is left untouched by this missing-in-action Prime Minister that just doesn't care about them. Since the election, I can't remember hearing the Prime Minister talk about the $275 reduction in power bills he promised. This government has overseen a price rise for electricity and gas. Food and grocery prices are up. Housing is up and insurance has increased. Real wages for working families have fallen 5 per cent in the last 12 months.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Lindsay, there is a high proportion of mortgage holders compared to those who own a home or rent, and the rate is higher than the New South Wales and Australian average. Interest rate rises are hitting families and are at their highest since 2011. We have many young families who just can't afford a home. They can't afford to rent. Renters are experiencing the largest increase to costs since 2009.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister is missing in action on fixing these issues. He should come to Penrith. Stop at the shops with me and talk to parents, talk to people who are struggling with their mortgage repayments over Christmas. I'll be there meeting with my community. He's very welcome to join me. These parents are telling me they can't afford their kids' swimming lessons—vital swimming lessons to keep kids safe. They just can't afford to live in our suburbs anymore and they're thinking about moving away.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Furthermore, this Prime Minister is missing in action on supporting growing communities through infrastructure that we desperately need. My electorate of Lindsay has been decimated by this Labor government when it comes to infrastructure. They have ripped $230 million away from Mulgoa Road, which is a project that has been in the works for years. This is the last piece of the puzzle, and it's gone. It just doesn't matter. It includes restoration of funding for the planning of Werrington arterial stage 2. This is the project that would ease congestion in that part of my community that links to Dunheved Road, a project that I fought really hard for. They're just missing in action when it comes to delivering the commitments that they made.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They actually promised to fast-track the upgrade to Dunheved Road during the election campaign. They came out to my community and said, 'We'll make this project go faster.' Do you think they can do that? No. Penrith council said that fast-tracking could never have occurred. So they actually misled my community during the election, which is even worse than not being there and being missing in action. There is nothing worse than misleading a community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Kingswood community has been crying out for an upgraded train station for many years. We promised to deliver that and it was set to happen. Actually, $3 million had been spent by Penrith council on the planning for this project. The Albanese Labor government don't care. It's been axed. They've also axed a really critical part of infrastructure for Western Sydney international airport. St Marys railway station was the major stop and interchange when coming through the city, out to the west and going out to the airport. The upgrade of the station and the car park has been axed. Not only that, they've actually axed a project which is under construction. I went out the other day with the shadow minister for infrastructure and stood on the M7-M12 interchange. Workers were everywhere, but this project is no longer funded.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What's going to happen now? It is not only the infrastructure projects that will suffer; it's the people that are working on these jobs and the small businesses that are supplying coffees, sandwiches and lunches. The whole local economy suffers when the Albanese Labor government just doesn't care. Not only is this government missing in action when it comes to important issues back home and the crisis when it comes to the cost of living; we have a crisis when it comes to infrastructure in Western Sydney. They have been misleading a community during an election, making promises they had no intention of keeping and cutting hundreds of millions of dollars away from infrastructure when we have a major international airport just a couple of years away.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My community deserves much better. They deserve honesty. They deserve a prime minister who cares. We deserve to have those commitments back and have the cost-of-living crisis as the No. 1 priority.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Chisholm</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:27</span>):  Once again, at the end of the year, we're here with another fairly ludicrous matter of public importance that highlights the poor track record of those opposite in government. Again, it makes us realise how deeply unserious those opposite are. There has been an interesting choice of words, I must say, in today's discussion. I certainly wouldn't want to remind people of the chaos of the previous 10 years, but they invite us to discuss chaos and they invite us to talk about leaders who are missing in action. I don't think Australians have forgiven the former Prime Minister, the member for Cook, for taking a holiday in Hawaii while Australia burned. I really don't think Australians have forgiven that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With every contribution that those opposite make in this place being to say no and to not offer anything of substance, we are once again subjected to an hour of discussion that is just not serious at all and is not in the interests of Australian people. But it's a great opportunity for me to contrast what we as a government are doing, and I really welcome the opportunity every day there's an MPI here in this place to talk about the achievements of the Albanese Labor government. I'm always happy to speak on the record of our government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the last 18 months we've delivered on a lot of key measures. We have delivered cheaper child care and cheaper medicines. We have delivered fee-free TAFE, and we've made it easier and cheaper for people to see a doctor. We've also delivered when it comes to the maximum cost of a prescription for PBS medicine, reducing the cost from $42.50 to $30. What's so significant about this is that it was the largest reduction in the 75-year history of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. Australians have saved $200 million on almost 18 million cheaper prescriptions since January this year. That is quite remarkable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This Prime Minister and our government argued for a Fair Work Commission minimum wage increase in line with inflation, delivering pay rises to those worst off. The Prime Minister was in Box Hill, in my electorate, when he said, 'Absolutely,' to the suggestion that the lowest-paid workers in this country should have a pay rise that keeps up with their cost of living. We've delivered a 15 per cent pay increase to aged-care workers. And we've done all of this at the same time as we've delivered the first budget surplus in 15 years. We've seen wages grow at around the fastest rate in a decade, and over 624,000 jobs have been created since we came to office. That's a record for any new government. We're making investments in the capacity of our economy, laying the foundations for future growth, and our efforts to repair the budget are taking pressure off inflation when it is most acute.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Dr GARLAND:</span>
                  </a>  We've maintained a primary focus on the cost of living, wages, jobs and building a stronger economy for all Australians, and all those opposite have are the negative interjections we're hearing now, no positive contributions whatsoever, and I do think that is a deep shame. Let's not forget what happened when those opposite were last in charge. We had economic mismanagement, with a trillion dollars in debt and not a cent of vision to show for it. Our economic plan is a deliberate and direct response to the economic circumstances that were left to us. We've turned a $78 billion deficit into a $22 billion surplus. That is a $100 billion turnaround. In contrast, those opposite promised a surplus every year since 2013 and didn't deliver a single one.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We understand household budgets are tight and the impact that cost-of-living pressures and inflation have, which is being felt around kitchen tables across the country. That's why we've been taking action to reduce pressure on the cost of living. All we've heard from those opposite is their saying no to relief packages. I wish this was a parliament where those opposite came together with us in government to deliver in the best interests of all Australians, but instead, as today's MPI is a testament to, all those opposite are interested in are cheap tricks, fear and division.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="249308" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms PRICE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Durack</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Opposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:32</span>):  Last week marked 18 months since the Labor Party was elected on the slogan of 'a better future'. Australians were told that, under the leadership of Anthony Albanese, they could expect a $275 reduction in power bills, cheaper mortgages and that families would be better off. He said life would be cheaper. But, as we know, since that time Australians have overwhelmingly been going backwards. Instead of saving that $275 a year that they were promised off their power bills, the cost of electricity has increased by 18 per cent, and the cost of gas has increased by a whopping 28 per cent. We've seen 12 interest rate rises, significantly raising mortgage repayments for Australian families and contributing to the highest rent increases since 2009. We saw in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian</span> newspaper today that 50 per cent of Australians polled consider themselves worse off under Labor than they were two years ago. Across every age group, the feedback was the same: more people are struggling.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly, the Australian dream of homeownership is slipping away. Millions of Aussies are battling increased mortgage repayments and those higher rents, while at the same time dealing with the higher cost of everyday necessities such as food, electricity and insurance. Yet addressing these concerns has not been the government's priority. The Prime Minister has spent months focused on the Voice to Parliament rather than addressing the rising cost of living. And for what? The proposal was rejected comprehensively in every state and territory, apart from the ACT, and has delivered nothing but division.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But it wasn't just on the economy that Labor made grand promises before the election in May 2022; they also promised to maintain Australia's national security and strong border protection policies. They told the Australian people, 'You can trust us.' The chaotic release of hundreds of criminal detainees is just the latest example of the Prime Minister's feeble leadership. On the Monday of the last sitting period, after the High Court made its ruling, releasing murderers, child rapists and perpetrators of domestic violence from detention, those opposite assured everyone in Australia that no legislation was needed to keep Australians safe. We then found out that detainees in Perth were simply left alone at a Willetton motel with no supervision or security. They were free to roam and come and go as they pleased. In what world is that taking the safety of Western Australians seriously? The Prime Minister then left the country, and the mess was left to be cleaned up by the hapless responsible ministers. Even with coalition amendments to the legislation the government introduced, there were still gaps that needed to be closed. We should never have got to this point. Labor should have had legislation ready to go instead of making policy on the run. As has been reported, Labor has already lost one of the released detainees.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For months now, we've had the Minister for Home Affairs and the Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs coming into this place constantly criticising the Leader of the Opposition for his time in his various ministerial roles. Seriously? I mean, seriously? They are not in opposition anymore. Have you not noticed you are now in government? You need to get on with the job. This is a serious job you've got. You need to move on from opposition to being in government. This is serious business that you've got. You should stop obsessing about our record and start focusing on good policy to keep Australians safe. That is your job. That's what you're paid to do. That's what Australians expect you to do. Of course, this applies to our Prime Minister as well. The Prime Minister needs to stop worrying about getting more evidence in his dirt unit, focusing on us. What he needs to do is think about the priorities. Australians need him to focus on keeping us safe. Australians want him to reduce the cost of living. We have families where mum and dad are both working and they cannot put food on the table for their families. This must be heartbreaking for these families, so we need a government to take the Australian people's needs seriously. Stop worrying about us; you are now in government. The Australian people said to you in May 2022, 'You're in charge now,' so it's time you took that responsibility seriously.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cunningham</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:37</span>):  If the other side want to talk about a Prime Minister missing in action, there is no better example than the member for Cook, who during his tenure led a government which allowed 435,000 Australians who rely on the social safety net to be targeted by their own government under the cruel and unlawful robodebt scheme. What a disgrace. This was a government that was missing in action on our aged-care system, letting it fall into neglect. This was a government that let millions of visa applications backlog, meaning people were just left waiting for a decision to see if they come to or stay in this country, waiting to find out if they could build a family here, waiting to visit their loved ones or waiting to bring much-needed skills to Australia. This was a government which watched Australian wages go backwards and did nothing. Let's not forget that this government was so distracted and chaotic that the member for Cook had to have himself secretly sworn into almost every frontbench portfolio.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In comparison, the Albanese Labor government has not wasted a minute in advancing the lives of Australians. I was ecstatic to welcome Prime Minister Anthony Albanese to the Illawarra, not once but twice since February this year alone, where he spent time talking to members of our community and visiting our amazing University of Wollongong. Under Prime Minister Albanese, this government has spent the past 18 months trying to unite the country while the Liberals have been trying to divide and derail progress. For the past 18 months, I have not wasted a second in fighting and delivering for our community, including through $33 million to support Hysata to develop new facilities to deliver low-cost hydrogen in Port Kembla and $10 million to establish an energy futures skill centre at the University of Wollongong so we have the skilled workforce to build the grid of the future.</span>

We've invested $500,000 in community batteries in Warrawong, making renewable energy available to some of the most vulnerable in our community. We've also opened a Medicare urgent care clinic in Corrimal to help ease the pressure on our local hospital emergency departments. We've had funding upgrades for local schools, including Bellambi Public School, Nareena Hills Public School, Wollongong West Public School, Farmborough Road Public School, Waniora Public School, Woonona East Public School, Coledale Public School, Tarrawanna Public School, St Francis of Assisi Catholic Primary School and Edmund Rice College.</span>

In aged care in the Illawarra we have backed in a 15 per cent pay rise for aged-care workers; achieved 24-hour nursing across our aged-care facilities 98 per cent of the time; funded 180,000 fee-free TAFE places for sectors in need, including in aged care across the country; partnered with the New South Wales government to deliver an additional 35 transitional aged-care beds in the Illawarra and Shoalhaven; and opened a Medicare urgent care clinic to also help with aged care.</span>

Today our government received reasons from the High Court. We are moving quickly to finalise a tough preventive detention regime before parliament rises. The safety of Australian citizens is our utmost priority. Yesterday the opposition voted against measures that would have criminalised sex offenders going near schools and childcare centres. We urge the parliament to support the government in protecting the Australian community.</span>

                    </a>  by leave—This report considers a proposal referred in September from the Department of Defence for its fuel transformation program tranche 2, which will take place at multiple Defence sites across Australia. The total cost of the proposed project is $286.9 million.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Following on from the first tranche of Defence's fuel transformation program, the proposed works will enhance the operation and performance of the defence fuel supply chain. This extensive supply chain distributes over $430 million of fuel each year through more than 100 sites across the nation. Works will take place at nine of these sites, which are located in South Australia, Victoria, Western Australia and Queensland. The works will consist of the following items: the construction of new fuel facilities and infrastructure, the decommissioning and demolition of existing fuel facilities and infrastructure, environmental remediation, and the construction of communications infrastructure to support the operation of Defence's fuel network.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Many of Defence's fuel storage assets are at least 30 years old and are no longer fit for purpose. Some single-wall steel tanks are beyond their service life, are no longer meeting current standards and are at risk of causing environmental harm through leakage. The works are expected to increase the service life of fuel storage assets by 50 years or more. Further, the works will support Defence's long-term net zero strategy and future transition to biofuel, as the new fuel storage can be used for biofuel and, obviously, for fossil fuel.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee understands that, if the project is tendered under budget, Defence will then use the savings to carry out project works in lower priority sites which are currently earmarked for the third and final tranche of the fuel transformation program. The committee notes that the completion of these items in conjunction with the proposed works where possible would maximise efficiency in both time and cost. I'm reliably informed by my wonderful secretariat that this is not an unusual process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee would like to thank personnel from the Department of Defence for facilitating a site inspection at one of the sites where works are proposed, the Garden Island precinct in New South Wales. The visit gave members of the committee an opportunity to understand the importance of the fuel transformation program for defence operation, as well as the necessity of each project element proposed in tranche 2. The committee recommends that it is expedient that the proposed work be carried out, and I commend the report to the House.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will explain to the House what is at stake here. Members of the House might recollect that approximately two weeks ago four bills were passed by the Senate. Those bills were the subject of a message which came to this House requesting that the House then deal with those bills. Indeed, on the document circulated by the Leader of the House—the blue—it was set out that the government intended to move that all of them be made an order of the day for the next sitting, with the result that they would have ended up on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Notice Paper</span>. That would have been the ordinary process. That would have been the ordinary thing that would have happened, consistent with the appropriate sharing of responsibilities between the two houses of the Australian parliament.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But that did not happen, because we saw from the Leader of the House a concerted attempt to drive those four bills into limbo so that they'd never be considered again. We saw the ludicrous spectacle, in respect of at least a couple of those bills, of the Leader of the House engaging in a go-slow. He sat on his hands and refused to stand and move that the message be dealt with or that the bills be made an order of the day. This of course is a very serious matter, because it means that in effect the House, under this government, is essentially thumbing its nose at the Senate. It's effectively saying to the Senate, 'Well, you may have passed four bills, but we're going to do nothing about it.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We heard a series of convoluted excuses from the Leader of the House as to why this occurred—liberal attempts to share the blame and allocate responsibility to everybody except himself. But the consequence of the course of action settled upon by the Leader of the House and by the government is that the four bills that passed the Senate are not on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Notice Paper</span> in this House of Representatives and have effectively fallen off the edge of the Earth as far as this government is concerned.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This raises very serious questions about the relationship between the two houses in our parliament. There is a set of arrangements under which bills move back and forth between the two houses so that legislation can be appropriately dealt with on behalf of the people of Australia. The Leader of the House is hopelessly conflicted on this issue, because in addition to his position as Leader of the House he is also the minister with responsibility for carriage of what is laughably described as the 'closing loopholes' bill—which might be better described as 'extraordinary expansion of the rights and powers of unions' bill. Because of that, he is personally violently opposed to the legislative strategy that had been arrived at by the Senate and particularly under the leadership of Senators Pocock and Lambie.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And I do want to acknowledge their leadership, because those two senators took a view as to how the interests of the Australian people and the interests of working people would be served regarding the four matters that were contained within the broader multi-hundred-page 'closing loopholes' bill that was introduced into the parliament by the minister—which contains, as it does, many matters that are incredibly contentious and are, in the view of objective commentators such as economists, business people and others, calculated to damage Australia's productivity, to mount a sustained attack on the whole notion of casual employment, to put millions of Australians in the position that the choice they've made to work as casuals and therefore receive a very significant loading and, in exchange for that, not have some of the other rights that attach to full-time work is under threat. That is all under threat because of this minister's extraordinary legislative ambition. I suggest to the House that there has also been an approach to this matter by the Leader of the House that is motivated by a desire to do whatever he can to prevent any threat to his bill's being considered in the way that he wants it to be considered.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The strategy that was arrived at by Senators Lambie and Pocock and which was supported by a majority of senators in the other place was to say, 'Let us, in the interests of the Australian people and in the interests of working people, identify matters within this multi-hundred-page bill brought forward by the minister which are not contentious, matters which are supported by all sides in this parliament.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Based upon that strategy, the two senators introduced private senators' bills—which were supported by a majority of senators—dealing with such matters as a rebuttable presumption that post-traumatic stress disorder suffered by selected first responders was contributed to by their employment. That was the first matter that was the subject of one of those bills. The next matter was measures to ensure that employees do not miss out on redundancy payments merely because their employer became a small business as a result of an insolvency procedure. The third matter dealt with the operation of antidiscrimination laws and adding to protect attributes of the discrimination-in-employment experience of family and domestic violence. The fourth matter was to expand the functions of the Asbestos Safety and Eradication Agency. The two senators introduced four private senators' bills, addressing in turn each of those four issues. Those bills were passed by the Senate. A message then came, in the ordinary way, from the Senate to the House, requesting that the House deal with these bills.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The House has failed to deal with these bills. They're not on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Notice Paper</span>. They appear to have disappeared. It is not at all surprising that the Senate is deeply troubled by that. That is the genesis of the request that has now arrived in the form of a message from the Senate to the House, requesting a conference. This is a procedure that is contemplated in the standing orders. It's not been used very often at all, but a majority of senators have arrived at the view and passed a motion today to the effect that, given the extraordinary lack of engagement by this parliament, by this chamber under the leadership of the Leader of the House, with the four messages that came from the Senate a couple of weeks ago asking the House to engage in relation to those four bills, there ought now be, as a next step, a conference held between the House and the Senate so that the status of these four bills can be agreed and so that a constructive way forward can be found.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Again I make the point that the underlying objective that the Senate—or that majority of senators that passed this motion—is seeking to achieve is in the interests of the Australian people, in the interests of working people, to be able to move forward in an expeditious fashion, reaching agreement in relation to those four matters which have already been passed by the Senate and in the ordinary course would have been dealt with by this House. But we saw the extraordinary spectacle a couple of weeks ago with the Leader of the House essentially refusing to engage, even though, on the blue circulated that day, it was documented that it was the government's intention to move that each of these bills be made an order of the day for the next sitting. Despite that being the intention of the Leader of the House at the time that that document was finalised and circulated to all members, at some point a few hours later he refused to do that. Since then there has been a matter of complete inaction on the part of this government as to what it intends to do in relation to those four bills. They're essentially doing nothing. It's a go-slow in the traditions of the union movement, who are, of course, the paymasters of the Labor Party.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Senate is simply saying to the House, it would seem, with this request: 'Let's sit down and sensibly work out what we'll do next. Let us use the procedures in the standing orders for a conference between the House and the Senate so that this matter can be addressed.' That would be instead of the ludicrous position being maintained by the government—that these bills have somehow disappeared, that these bills are not on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Notice Paper</span>. We will hear all kinds of excuses, I have no doubt. I confidently predict we will hear all kinds of excuses from the Leader of the House as to why we are unable to deal with this matter. But, on this side of the House, what we say is that we ought to engage constructively. We stand prepared to engage constructively. I call on the crossbench and, indeed, I call on the government, quite frankly, to engage constructively. We have an opportunity to move with alacrity to get these matters dealt with. The Senate already provided an opportunity a couple of weeks ago. The government refused to engage. We will hear all kinds of technical arguments as to why. We'll hear that it's beyond the control of the Leader of the House. It is nonsense. Clearly if there was the will this matter could be resolved very quickly. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact that the Senate has found it necessary to request this conference is, I think, an indicator of the seriousness of what has occurred here and the seriousness of the fact that the government and the Leader of the House have chosen to play games and to essentially refuse to engage with bills which have passed the Senate and which have been the subject of a message from the Senate. There are well-established protocols as to how this is dealt with. Right now, the government is simply folding its arms and saying: 'We're not going to deal with it. We're not going to do anything.' That is completely inappropriate. It is completely inconsistent with the framework of mutual respect that must operate between the two houses if the parliament is to do its work on behalf of the Australian people. The Senate, by moving this motion which has passed the Senate calling on this House to agree to a conference, is saying, 'Let us engage sensibly on these matters.' On this side of the House, we think that does make sense.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is why I have moved that this message be considered immediately. If that motion succeeds, I will then very constructively be moving a motion which would set out a way forward. What we believe that could involve is a conference of 12 delegates. The House would be represented at the conference by 12 delegates, four nominated by the Leader of the House, four nominated by the Manager of Opposition Business and four drawn from the crossbench, nominated by the Chief Opposition Whip. So we are engaging constructively with the Senate, and we call on the government to engage constructively with the Senate so that we can take seriously our responsibilities in this House.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I close with this proposition. It is completely unacceptable for the House, under the leadership of this government and this Leader of the House, to simply seek to wash its hands of the matter and not engage with bills which have been passed by the Senate. It's unprecedented. The action taken by the Senate to call for a conference is one way forward, and we support it. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're here because Senators Pocock and Lambie have successfully moved a motion in the Senate, and the Senate has officially sent a message to the House requesting a particular action to be taken—namely, the holding of a conference. On behalf of the opposition I'd like to thank Senators Pocock and Lambie for their work, for their leadership on this point. The message from the Senate has now been received, and it's now up to the House to decide when to consider this message. The question of 'when' is now before the House. After the question of when the House ought to consider the message is resolved, a motion could be moved to give effect to the message's request—namely, that the conference be convened between the two chambers of this parliament.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, this is an extraordinary step. The opposition has not moved this motion lightly. Motions of this kind, as I said, are very rare. The only time the Senate has requested a conference was 22 June 1950, when the Senate resolved to request a conference with the House on an amendment by the House to a bill that had originated in the Senate. As it eventuated then, the House did not agree to the request for a conference. I'm not sure whether the Leader of the House was in the House back in 1950—similar tactics? But in the life of the House there have been few times that the House itself has requested a conference with the Senate and fewer times still that one has been agreed.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">According to <span style="font-style:italic;">Practice</span>, the last time there was a conference or joint sitting of this kind—there's some vagueness about this—was 2001. At that time, parliamentarians met to mark the centenary of the first meetings of the houses of the Commonwealth parliament in 1901. So these conferences and the motions that give effect to them are rare occurrences, and they should be treated carefully.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">As is evident by the motion, negotiations between the government and other members and senators have broken down on the legislation noted in the Senate's message—indeed, broken down to such an extent that the Senate has felt compelled to make this extraordinary request of the House. This is regrettable. At every step along the way the Leader of the House has tried to block scrutiny of his own industrial relations legislation. Members would recall that the opposition initially moved, some months ago, to subject this bill to an advisory report. The government voted this motion down, because they were afraid of what dirty deals would be uncovered in their omnibus fair work amendment.</span>

                  </a>  I'll take the caution from the Leader of the House. The pattern of behaviour by the Leader of the House in trampling on the proper procedures and processes of this place has now extended to the conduct of the fair work amendments consideration-in-detail stage. Last week the Leader of the House moved a motion for the suspension of standing orders crunching down time for debate such that the opposition would have only 20 minutes to debate detailed government amendments. This is a Leader of the House who, I recall, would come in here when he was Manager of Opposition Business and complain bitterly about the former government guillotining debate. This is a Leader of the House who, when he was Manager of Opposition Business, constantly complained about that and said that he wouldn't be doing that when he was in government. But, lo and behold, here we are.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These amendments will come on for debate later this afternoon, as I'm told, which only highlights the urgent need for a conference and for this motion to pass. It is the height of hypocrisy from the Leader of the House, who made grand statements before the election wanting to fix how this chamber would operate, to then, once in power, do the very opposite.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If I can remind the House about what the Leader of the House said at the National Press Club earlier this year, on 1 February:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The consultative approach that we have applied to the Parliament itself and to the way we have governed is of itself not just a difference in the way Government functions.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If the minister truly believes in what he said then, then he would vote for this motion, which is all about ensuring that we establish between the two houses of this parliament a conference to resolve the intractable problems senators and members share with respect to elements of the government's latest fair work amendment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This meeting, between the chambers of the parliament, would be a multipartisan forum. It would see members and senators come together to consult on how to overcome the government's stubborn refusal to consider commonsense legislation. Critically, it would allow members and senators time to examine in detail the amendments that were tabled by the Leader of the House just before 1.30 pm today. We could see, for example, how these amendments align with those noted in the Senate's message, but these government amendments, I remind the House, are subject to a guillotine motion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact that a conference hasn't happened in decades reflects how poorly the government has managed the legislative process around its own industrial relations agenda. It is indeed a rare event when any members move such a motion to enable a conference, but the actions of the Leader of the House has forced the hand of the Senate and, indeed, has forced the hand of the opposition. To this, I urge all members to support our colleagues in the Senate, particularly Senators Lambie and Pocock, and support this motion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to remind members in this place that in September the government introduced a new omnibus workplace relations bill to the parliament. I note the omnibus bill is presently the subject of a Senate inquiry that will report on 1 February 2024. Across the economy, stakeholders have justifiably condemned most of the provisions in this fair work amendment. A more sensible option, originating in the Senate, was presented to the government. The four areas from the original omnibus bill, which have been split out by the crossbench, should never have been part of the original bill. I note the House previously dealt with this proposition.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The bills mentioned in the Senate's message to the House seek uncontroversial changes that should be implemented as quickly as possible. Major business groups, including the BCA, ACCI, AiG and COSBOA, all support these parts of the omnibus bill and support them being split out and dealt with immediately. They've been very public in this regard.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This was a test for the government, and the government failed. There was no credible reason for the government to argue against passing these bills. These bills were drawn word for word from the proposed legislation in the Albanese government's so-called closing the loopholes bill. These measures should never have been part of that omnibus bill, but we all know why the minister included these measures in his controversial bill—it was a cynical exercise by the minister to give this government cover for trying to rush its wider controversial legislation through the parliament.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is disgraceful to use the issue of PTSD in this nation's first responders as a reason for trying to ram through the loopholes bill this year. It is also disgraceful to use changes related to silica diseases, the discrimination of people suffering family or domestic violence, or using redundancy payments for the same reason—but we have the opportunity to move forward quickly with these important and uncontroversial changes by passing the government's own legislation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, in the seconds left, I would like to speak very quickly about the importance of the first responders' bill. The bill introduces a rebuttable presumption that post-traumatic stress disorder suffered by selected first responders was contributed to to a significant degree by their employment. This change will simplify— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr BURKE:</span>
                  </a>  If the bill is in the possession of the House, this process can't be used. On any other occasion, when a private member's bill reaches this House, a private member stands up and takes control of it. That's what ordinarily happens. What's on the blue there? There is a whole lot on the blue that gets referred to by members, some of which says, 'Debate will be adjourned.' Most of the time, the adjournment is done by an opposition member. That's what ordinarily happens. Similarly, when a private member's bill happens, the resolution that it be made an order of the day can be moved by a government member or an opposition member. There is no requirement that, because it appears on the blue, it somehow becomes the responsibility of the government to do it. The leader of the Greens party managed to follow procedure in previous terms and, as a result of following procedure, actually did the full second reading on a private member's bill that had come across from the Senate. He did a full private member's bill—I don't know if you're washing your hands or something. Are you trying to get hold of—in COVID days, we all had to do that as we walked in.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Manager of Opposition Business was told by the Speaker what he had to move. But he was too smart! He knew better! He had four different occasions. The first time, I did move it for him, and he filibustered to stop it from coming to a vote. That's why the first one wasn't on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Notice Paper</span>. For the second one, he never did anything. For the third one, he'd been told by the Speaker what to do, and he refused to. For the fourth, he refused again. That is the only reason this method is open to the Senate. Otherwise, the bills would be in the possession of the House.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But I'll tell you what is going on here. Have a think about what we just heard as to which organisations are publicly in favour of just getting these bits through and forgetting about the rest of the bill. They are all organisations that have members that are using the loopholes to undercut wages—every single one of them. Name one workers organisation that is actually arguing for this. Name one. There's no workers organisation calling for this, including the ones affected most by PTSD, like the Australian Federal Police Association. They are not calling for this action. So why do you think it might be that only those people who want to drive wages down, who are paid by their members to keep their wages bill low, are the ones who say, 'We'll just pull these parts out'?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am very proud to say that no member of the Labor Party, no government MP in this place or the other place, has moved for a single part of this bill to be delayed—not one! But for those opposite right now to be going through the charade of this, where they say, 'If they get to deal with it, their plan is to pretend that the numbers in this chamber are a third, a third, a third'—that's what we're told the numbers will be on the resolution if this motion to deal with it immediately is successful. That's what the Manager of Opposition Business says he will move. He's not even trying to take it seriously.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've got to say: we've had quotes from <span style="font-style:italic;">P</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ractice</span> but they always stop at the critical thing. <span style="font-style:italic;">Practice</span> also says it seems unlikely that a formal conference would be used to resolve disagreements between the houses in contemporary political circumstances. <span style="font-style:italic;">Practice</span> makes clear that this process is not a way of resolving differences between the houses. This is not a practical way of dealing with differences between the houses. But this game is a game those opposite played for nine years and want to continue to play now—a game of, 'Let's do everything we can to delay fixing underpayments for Australia's workers.' They might have continued to get away with that in a House of Representatives where we had a government where low-wage growth was a deliberate design feature of their economic management, but that's not the case anymore.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's make clear that the delay they originally sought on when we would debate this bill and get through it in the House of Representatives was for a date that has already passed. The government has already given more time for this bill than those opposite sought when it was first introduced, when we had those votes to say how long it could be delayed. We have allowed the full length of time plus more before this bill comes to the stages of amendments. But the time we have set aside for amendments has been wasted by the charade and the procedural game of the Manager of Opposition Business—a procedural game which is only available to him because he has demonstrated a level of laziness and sheer incompetence that knocks all his predecessors from each side of politics out of the park. No-one comes close. No-one before has ever failed the simple test of: 'Can you say the words out loud to put a bill on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Notice Paper</span>?' Even when told by the Speaker, 'These are the words you need to say out loud; you need to read them out one at a time and say them into a microphone', this Manager of Opposition Business can't handle that. Please! I don't know who decided that he got the job but can you at least give me someone I can argue with. Can you at least give me somebody who knows there's a big book called <span style="font-style:italic;">Practice</span>, there's a little book called <span style="font-style:italic;">Standing orders</span> and there are procedures that the parliament is meant to follow, and then we can have a debate on the issues. This incompetence is like nothing we've ever seen.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It never occurred to me for a minute when I came in here, when we were receiving those messages from the Senate on the private member's bills, that none of them would end up on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Notice Paper</span>. It never occurred to me that the Manager of Opposition Business would think it was clever to filibuster his own amendment and prevent it from coming to a vote. It never occurred to me that someone could be that ignorant, that lazy or that plain stupid to have an opportunity come across from the Senate and say, 'Yeah, I'm just going to not let it happen, and then I'll complain about it; that'll be my strategy.' The strategy that this parliament should have is to get wages moving. The strategy this parliament should have is to end underpayments, to criminalise wage theft, to give minimum standards to gig workers, to give rights to casual workers and to make sure that the labour hire loophole is closed so that people with the same experience and same expertise working side-by-side aren't on different rates of pay because of a labour hire rort and a labour hire loophole. With that in mind, once we've dealt with this we can deal with the bill at hand. I move:</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BURKE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Watson</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, Minister for the Arts and Leader of the House</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:55</span>):  Much of the content of the amendments that are before the House now has been made public as it's been developed and negotiated, particularly with some key business groups. It was stated earlier that the amendments have been in the House since 1.30. They've been in the House since midday but were moved just before 1.30, when 90-second statements commenced. We've continued to consult following introduction of the bill, as we did with workplace relations legislation last year, and many of the amendments arise from that consultation. I'll deal with them in groups.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The first are the amendments to casual employment. These are the amendments that were negotiated with the Australian Hotels Association and publicly welcomed by the Pharmacy Guild. The government's welcomed stakeholder feedback where there were genuine and practical amendments to help clarify the intent of the reforms, and I want to commend the positive engagement from business groups—in particular the Australian Hotels Association. We've listened, and these amendments further clarify that a person who works a regular pattern of work can still meet the definition of a casual employee. We're providing additional certainty for businesses and for workers who prefer regular casual employment, and we're also allaying any concern about civil penalties from mistaken misclassification.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're also repealing the existing residual right to request casual conversion in the Fair Work Act. This amendment clarifies that eligible casual employees who wish to change to permanent employment can do so through the new employee choice pathway. This will ensure arrangements are clear and simple for business, particularly small business. These amendments also should once and for all end the claim that this bill could in any way force somebody who did not want to convert from casual to permanent to do so. It is a voluntary system that is put in place, and these amendments make that plain.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On closing the labour hire loophole, one of the key arguments made by business groups was that there was concern about whether or not the legislation had unintentionally caught service contractors. The provisions were never intended to apply to service contracting, as is reflected in the explanatory memorandum to the closing loopholes bill. I want to acknowledge the engagement with the Australian Resources and Energy Employer Association, AREEA, and Professor Andrew Stewart, who had raised concerns and called for an amendment of this form. However, to make this even clearer than it was in the explanatory memorandum, the government amendment ensures the Fair Work Commission cannot make an order where work performed for a host is the provision of a service rather than the supply of labour. These amendments expressly provide that the Fair Work Commission must not make an order unless it is satisfied that the work is not for the provision of a service rather than supply of labour; delete the words 'wholly or principally' from the multifactor test, providing further certainty on how the multifactor test will operate; and clarify the termination entitlements for a labour hire employee covered by a regulated labour hire arrangement order. The amendment is a commonsense way of cutting red tape for business and simplifies leave entitlements while still preserving the government's policy intention.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Further amendments safeguard the operation of regulated labour hire arrangement orders from avoidance behaviour once they are made; ensure the continued operation of regulated labour hire arrangement orders where there's a change in commercial arrangements for the supply of labour or where a host business makes a new enterprise agreement; and ensure orders are effective and are able to capture all the relevant parties in complex labour hire arrangements, including for arrangements as part of a joint venture or common enterprise.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the clock winds down, I should make clear that I will, as is provided in the resolution, be making sure that the time for this goes beyond the 20 minutes allocated.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've listened on employee-like reforms, we've listened to platforms, and we appreciate the valuable consultations with organisations such as Uber, Menulog and DoorDash. These amendments ensure the Fair Work Commission sets minimum standards in a way that is fit for purpose for the unique nature of digital platform work. The amendments clarify the minimum standards objective, including—and I might just seek the call again—</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr BURKE:</span>
                    </a>  by requiring the Fair Work Commission to take into account that workers may work on more than one platform at a time—multi-apping—and consider the impacts standards would have on users of platform services and on business costs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments require the Fair Work Commission to publish a notice of intent before setting minimum standards for employee-like workers and to genuinely engage with affected parties. Further guardrails will provide greater certainty. The amendments limit standards relating to penalty rates, payments before and between accepting engagements, and minimum periods of engagement to where it is appropriate for the type of work performed. The amendments provide further assurance that employee-like workers to whom a minimum standards order applies are not employees of any person in relation to that work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're also ensuring that the new definition of employment commences on 1 July 2024, the same time as the employee-like reforms. The amendment provides an important new protection for employee-like workers against being unfairly removed from a digital labour platform. It will ensure that legitimate management action, including temporary suspension, can occur where there is a reasonable belief of fraud or health and safety concerns. In certain circumstances a platform may suspend a worker's access to a platform for a period of up to seven business days.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On delegates rights, the small business definition had the term 'small business' rather than 'small business employer', and that's being fixed. On the protected action ballot conferences, this amendment clarifies that only the bargaining representative or representatives who apply for a protected action ballot order must attend the conciliation conference in order for subsequent employee claim action to be protected. It also clarifies that employer bargaining representatives must attend the conference for any employer response action to be protected.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's an amendment to the Coal Long Service Leave Corporation board of directors provision, simply to update the withdrawal of the mining and energy division from the Construction Forestry Maritime Mining and Energy Union. On the Financial Framework (Supplementary Powers) Act silica awareness-raising activities, this is a technical amendment to clarify the relationship between the new functions that will be conferred on ASEA and the Commonwealth's powers under the Financial Framework (Supplementary Powers) Act 1997 in relation to silica awareness-raising activities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On the Family and Injured Workers Advisory Committee, this amendment to the Work Health and Safety Act establishes a new Family and Injured Workers Advisory Committee, which will provide advice to me, to future ministers and to the Commonwealth work health and safety regulators on the support needs of those affected by serious workplace incidents and to help inform the development of relevant policies and strategies. The establishment of this committee follows ongoing discussions I have had with families affected by a workplace fatality, including courageous advocates whom members will have met with, like Kay Catanzariti, Dr Lana Cormie and Michael Garrels. Thank you for your tireless commitment to reform. We are committed to taking action to prevent tragic accidents from occurring but, if they do, to ensuring that we have the right supports in place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank all members for their engagement on the bill. In short, other than the committee, this is largely a set of technical amendments to the bill, including the three areas in consultation with the gig platforms, in consultation with the hotels association and in consultation with AREEA to make sure that the policy intent of the original bill has been met.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr FLETCHER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bradfield</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Manager of Opposition Business</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:03</span>):  I say to anybody who is listening to this parliamentary debate that you should be put on notice that whenever the minister at the table, the member for Watson, uses his reasonable tone, something very, very dodgy is happening. And I'll tell you what is happening that is very, very dodgy. At approximately midday today 36 pages of amendments were introduced by this government. They had not been made available to the opposition or to the crossbench prior to that time—36 pages of detailed amendments, yet we are conducting this debate under a set of changes to the standing orders moved by this minister and rammed through this House saying that the total time available for discussion on these 36 pages of detailed amendments is 20 minutes. Twenty minutes of debate is all the government sees fit to make available for any attempt to consider these very detailed matters.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that just about nothing this minister says on these matters can be trusted. When you look at the dodginess of the process he is using and the government is using, it is clear that he is showing contempt for this House and contempt for the Australian people. For example, we were told by the minister in the public domain on a number of occasions over the past few months that service contractors were already clearly excluded under the wording of his draft bill. Yet we now know, from the fact that the minister has, he tells us, moved amendments that deal with service contractors, that that claim was completely incorrect. I want to go specifically to the question of casuals, because one of the most problematic aspects of this bill is that there is an extremely complex definition of casual employment. There are 15 steps that you need to work through to determine whether an employee is a casual or not a casual.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have some questions for the minister, and I'd like to ask him the following: can the minister explain to the House the 15 steps that need to be considered in determining whether an employee is casual or not? Can a casual employee work a wholly regular pattern of hours? Can the minister confirm that, under the provisions proposed, even if a person wants to be a casual employee, has sought out to be a casual employee and has agreed in writing that he or she is a casual employee, on the terms of the definition, the Fair Work Commission can determine that the person is not in fact a casual employee? Can the minister explain the definition of 'deliberate misrepresentation' and when it applies so that somebody who is understood by himself or herself and by that person's employer to be a casual could retrospectively be determined not to be a casual?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another question I have for the minister is about the tension between the legislative note that he's holding out as the solution to this problem and proposed section 15A(3)(c), which states that a pattern of work is regular for the purposes of subparagraph (2)(c)(iv) even if it is not absolutely uniform and includes some fluctuation or variation over time. I ask the question of the minister: how will the Fair work Commission determine the status of an employee given the contradiction between proposed section 15A(3)(c) and the wording of his legislative note? I further ask the minister how he seriously puts forward the proposition that this definition adds clarity when we know that it's a three-page, 15-part definition and that during Senate estimates just last month we had the opportunity to see some 20 to 30 minutes taken by three industrial relations experts from the government's own department to explain this definition. I further ask the minister whether he truly believes that a business owner who is dealing with a continually rising cost of business inputs, with ever-increasing regulation and with more hoops to jump through, can be expected to read through this three-page definition of a casual employee and work out what he or she needs to do to be compliant in just 15 minutes. Can the minister confirm that, in fact, even if a contract says that somebody is a casual, that is not definitive of that person's status? I have plenty more questions to ask, but because I've arrived at my time limit, I'll defer to colleagues.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">North Sydney</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:08</span>):  I want to start tonight by acknowledging that the minister and his team have worked very hard to try and ensure that anyone who wished to be engaged in this process for review around the Fair Work Legislation Amendment (Closing Loopholes) Bill 2023 was given time. That is true. It's a fair thing to say, and I want to acknowledge that and thank you for that. With that said, it's been incredibly difficult for me as a member of the crossbench to have received these amendments at 12.30 or one o'clock—whenever they came in—and now, just five hours later, to feel that I am across their implications. I have a number of questions that I'm hoping the minister can answer to help me understand. I can see that there are clear efforts here to meet some of the feedback that you've received, particularly from large business groups, and I thank you for doing that. There is no doubt that we need to do everything we can to continue to encourage businesses to employ Australians, and we need to ensure that Australians who wish to work are able to work under the conditions that they seek to have.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the explanatory memorandum, point 6 talks about the Fair Work Commission being able to join additional employers to an application for a regulated labour hire arrangement order where it is satisfied that more than one employer is supplying or will supply employees through a regulated host. Can the minister help me understand whether this means that the Fair Work Commission will actually have the powers to reach beyond a case to bring other companies into a case that it may be looking at? Similarly, I would also like to understand, when you talk about the provisions—this is point 15 of the explanatory memorandum. 'The deactivation from a digital labour platform would not be unfair'—am I right in understanding that to mean that the government is trying to provide advice to businesses on when they can deactivate someone rather than leaving that decision up to the businesses themselves based on their own business operating principles?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I am interested in the provisions under explanatory note No. 21, which talks about the appointment to the board of directors for the coal and mining industry. Am I correct in reading that to mean that, in fact, that means there will be another seat now on that board and that that seat will be held for the mining and energy division particularly as opposed to previously there being one seat that was meant to cover construction, forestry, maritime, mining and energy unions? There will now be two seats for those unions?</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Goldstein</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:11</span>):  I echo the sentiments of the member for North Sydney. She and I have been poring over this intermittently for the last several hours, trying to work through a very heavy stack of amendments. Again, I appreciate the engagement with the minister and his office. My question is more generalised. I think it's not only for members of this chamber to understand; I think members of the public would be curious to know what the rush is. In many ways the Senate has been in mutiny on this, sending back a pretty unusual mechanism to try to delay this through a conference that I believe hasn't been used since the 1930s, which is a fairly radical step to prevent this legislation from passing this week. Given the Senate committee process and our understanding that, as we have discussed extensively, the bill that comes back in the end in February will be vastly different to anything that we vote on today, I'm still not really clear why we have to rush this through before Christmas.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BURKE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Watson</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, Minister for the Arts and Leader of the House</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:13</span>):  First of all, there are a few different issues there. I will start with the questions about the definition of a 'casual'. Effectively, when you talk about what all these other elements of a 'casual' are, a lot of what's being legislated goes back to what the common law had been for a very long time until quite recently. Effectively, we're in a legislative sense going back to an objective definition of a 'casual'. But, on the question of whether, if someone doesn't want to convert, they have to convert, the answer is that, if you want to stay a casual, you can stay a casual. It is as simple as that. I know there's an attempt to make that complex; it's actually quite straightforward.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will go through the issues of the member for North Sydney first. On coal long service leave, there is already a position there, and it's simply that the position under the statute is for the mining division of the CFMEU. That's what's already there. The mining division is about to leave the CFMEU and they voted for the de-amalgamation. Effectively, we weren't as advanced with that when I introduced the bill. We're now there, so we're taking the chance to move the amendment so they don't, in fact, lose their position on that board. But it is not an additional position; it is simply a renaming because the organisation itself has renamed. So that's that one.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With respect to multiple arrangements, can I explain first of all the problem we're wanting to solve. The problem we're wanting to solve is if you have a company that uses a number of different labour hire firms for the purpose that this bill deals with. It only realistically happens with a company with high enterprise agreement rates where they are using labour hire for work that their direct employees otherwise do and they are wanting to go down to the award or a lower rate. They are using it to undercut the rate they've otherwise agreed to. One of the problems that had been pointed out in consultation was that, if someone makes an application to the labour hire firm they work for to have that fixed so that what people are being paid goes up to the enterprise agreement rates, if the company is using multiple labour hire firms then effectively you haven't solved the problem. They will just switch firms and go to other firms. So this is to give the commission the capacity that, if they are working with a number of labour hire firms, effectively it can make an order that applies to whichever labour hire firms might come in for those particular tasks. It gives the commission the authority to be able to do that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The concept of deactivation is largely in the terms which the member for North Sydney said. There are extra words that were put in there to effectively give advice and guardrails and to make clear that there are circumstances where deactivation would be completely reasonable just as there are circumstances when dismissal in an employment relationship is completely reasonable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll finally go to the issue of, 'What's the rush?' and the Senate committee process. There has been a long process in the Senate of delaying the bill. They are entitled to have their processes and do it the way they have. But the impact is that a couple of weeks ago, during a Senate-only week, they switched 1 February from being the latest date the Senate committee could report to it being the earliest date they could report. These dates have continued to be pushed out over time. My concern is that, if we don't give them the completed bill from the House of Representatives for their final meeting, which is in January, what will happen is we will still be moving amendments next year, we'll send it to them then and they'll say, 'Now we need another inquiry because you moved amendments to the bill.' I'm not saying every senator will argue that, but I certainly know some will. Some of the business organisations have already started saying, 'If there is an amendment, we now need a further delay.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On the timelines in the bill where people say, 'That provision doesn't start for some time,' some, or most, of those delays are in fact to give the commission time to get processes in place so that they can be made simple and they can get all the information out to employers. On the labour hire loophole, for example, even though it won't start for some time into next year, the concept is that the cases and the work will be able to be done straightaway and there will be a whole lot of work by the commission leading up to these dates. Some people have looked at it sceptically and said, 'What is the rush?' in the sense of saying, 'Why are you rushing the bill when the starting dates for those provisions are late?' The starting provisions for some sections of the bill are late, but the work would begin immediately. The work of the Fair Work Ombudsman would begin immediately. The work of the Fair Work Commission would begin immediately.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We had significant information come back to us after last year's bill about the number of provisions that commenced on the same day. One of the things that the Fair Work Commission fed back to the government and directly to me was that, for their processes, it is much more helpful if we stagger the start dates. Then they are in a better position, for both workers' representatives and business organisations, to be able to get processes in place and make sure that there is very clear communication.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't believe we can responsibly leave the House of Reps amendments to any later than this week. We deal with them this week. I would love the Senate to be dealing with them next week, in the Senate-only week, but I think chances of that are remote, at best. They will make their decisions as to when they'll deal with the bill, but I do know this: if we don't give them a completed bill for their final hearing in January—and our only chance to do that is today and tomorrow—then it will be used as a new excuse for a further delay, and a further delay starts to hit a whole lot of provisions for when they're able to start. So that's the reason.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do know that some amendments to be dealt with by the crossbench could have been affected by amendments that I moved. To that end, this bill is listed for today and tomorrow. Some people who were in that circumstance—I know the member for Fowler is not, and the member for Melbourne, the Leader of the Green Party, is not—wanted that delay. That's why, once we've dealt with my amendments, the amendments from the member for Fowler and the amendments from the Australian Greens, I'll adjourn the debate so that tomorrow the crossbench have that time. I hear there is always an argument of 'Can we have more time?' But, within the limits and constraints that we have, I really want these benefits to be reaching workplaces. I don't want to give the Senate a reason for a further delay beyond the delays they've already put in place.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bradfield</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Manager of Opposition Business</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:21</span>):  I want to turn to a couple of other aspects of the 30-plus pages of amendments—36 pages of amendments, with nine separate sets of amendments which the government made available around midday today and then brought on this debate less than six hours later. Of course, it's under a guillotine which involves a cap of 20 minutes for the consideration-in-detail phase, which is, frankly, making a mockery of the processes of this parliament and showing this minister's, and this government's, contempt for the parliament and contempt for the Australian people. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the areas where there has been very significant concern across the economy is the impact of the minister's bill in relation to service contractors because, across the economy, there are many large and small companies that provide services under contract to other businesses. They might be a company like Downer EDI, to take one example, but there are many. I know from my own time in the telecommunications sector, there are many service contractors who provide particular services to telcos such as Telstra, Optus or TPG. They might be services in relation to the rollout of a network. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The problem with the clumsy and expansive drafting that the government has used is that service contractors are facing the very real risk that they will get caught by these provisions, such that, while they're not, in fact, labour hire contractors at all, they could find themselves in the position that their employees are suddenly employed automatically under the same terms as those used by the company to which they are providing a contract. Minister, you've told media outlets that 'service contractors were completely exempted'. I want to ask this specific question: even with the amendments that you have brought in today, would those firms still be required to prove that they are not labour hire firms? Is there a process that is required? I ask the minister to enlighten Australians on that, which is one of many areas which are deeply murky. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to come to the question of the gig economy because, again, we heard smooth assurances in this minister's best honeyed tones just a few minutes ago which should put any rational person on notice that he's doing something deeply dodgy.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These amendments seek to clarify some matters in the bill and also make some changes that will mean that workers in this country get greater protection. At a time of a significant cost-of-living crisis and also where wages and conditions need to be protected, these amendments will deliver some real benefits to workers, which is something that the Greens have been keen to secure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are three sets of amendments here. The first set deals with the question of casual employment. In the bill introduced by the government, there are factors around casual employment where the bill talks about seasons. On an initial reading of the bill—and some concerns have been raised about this, including during the inquiry process—there was a concern that 'season' could have been taken to include people who work in fixed defined periods in universities or schools—so teachers or lecturers. There was a concern that a school term or a university semester could count as a 'season'. These amendments clarify that by including a note to make it clear that teachers don't count as seasonal workers, just because they're working on a semester basis. We know that this is a significant problem because many people in universities and schools have been called casuals or put on short-term arrangements, and, come the end of the semester, they find themselves out of a job and out of an income. Of course, we need teachers and lecturers from year to year, and, simply because there's an end to a semester, you can't somehow call that seasonal work. 'Seasonal work' is meant to deal with other matters that the government has outlined in the bill, but it's not lecturers and it's not teachers. These amendments will clarify that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second set of amendments deliver a really important protection to workers, and that is to include in the wage theft provisions the nonpayment of superannuation. We know that this is a massive problem for many workers. Their superannuation just doesn't get paid. Most employers do the right thing, but, in those instances where they don't, it's that the employer doesn't see it as a serious enough obligation to do it. In the bill, the government is making wage theft an offence, and, although superannuation might not technically be paid to employees—it's paid to a third person on the employee's behalf—nonetheless it's for the benefit of the employee. Workers, particularly young workers, who often find themselves without superannuation, really shouldn't have to go to court to get that remedied. It should be up to the employer to the right thing from the beginning. So, in the same way that the government has introduced a new offence with respect to wage theft, the amendment that we're moving will expand that to include superannuation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The last set of amendments deal with an issue that I think was probably an unforeseen consequence of a previous government piece of legislation. The government previously did a very good thing, which was to say that employers can't use the threat of terminating agreements during negotiations as a way of getting leverage, which is something that many employers were doing. One of the things the government did was introduce provisions to enable protracted disputes to be arbitrated. What has happened since then is that some employers, especially in the university sector, have picked this up and are advising some of their members, 'We can wait out negotiating periods and just go to the commission to get the claims arbitrated and potentially get the same result via a backdoor way.' I don't think that was the intention of the first legislation, and so this just closes the loophole. It means that, if you end up in arbitration, you can't go backwards. It doesn't provide a way of going forward, but it does mean that people can't go backwards, which maintains the spirit of the underlying principle of the act, which is that agreements remain in place until a new one is negotiated. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

There have been a number of meetings with, in particular, the member for Melbourne and with Senator Pocock. I'm very grateful for that, and these amendments all improve the bill.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some would argue that wage theft is already covered under tax law with respect to superannuation, but the challenge there is that it's only when it's not being paid, you get an order 'you need to pay it' and you breach that order; there it's a criminal offence. However, with this amendment, when a prosecution is happening for wage theft, it will allow for it to deal with superannuation theft at the exact same time. We know that, if there's an underpayment that's likely to happen first, it's very likely that in fact it is superannuation. So we're very pleased to support that part of the amendment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Similarly, the change with respect to casual employment makes sure that a 'specified season' has the meaning that it should have, and I'm grateful for that being brought forward.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On the final amendment, about the consideration of a prior enterprise agreement with respect to a subsequent workplace determination, I want to reinforce to the House that what this effectively does is bring back a concept that was there before we introduced the arbitration principles. It used to be that the old agreement would just remain in place. This allows that, as a result of the secure jobs, better pay laws, we don't end up in a worse situation than that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am aware of reports of certain employer consultants—one of whom, who has had a long history with the other side of politics—who have been providing advice to businesses on how they might be able to game the laws we put in last year to actually find ways of workers going backwards during the course of arbitration. We introduced the legislation and supported the legislation last year, secure jobs, better pay, because we wanted to get wages moving, not because we wanted to find an opportunity for certain employers—and this is certainly not most employers—to game the system and find ways to get conditions to go backwards. These amendments fix that, and we're happy to support them.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Jagajaga</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:43</span>):  Paid parental leave is essential for working families, for parents and for their children. The changes in this bill update a scheme that is now more than a decade old. It does the work those opposite failed to do during their time in government but the work that Labor governments do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Almost 13 years ago, the Gillard government introduced Australia's first national Paid Parental Leave scheme. This change was spearheaded by Jenny Macklin, my predecessor as the member for Jagajaga, and I was proud to work with Jenny to help bring paid parental leave to life as part of the reforming work of the Gillard government. This Labor government is now doing the work to continue to help Australians and Australian families, building on the existing Paid Parental Leave scheme and the positive impacts it's had and that we've seen in the past 13 years, making it even better.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These reforms to Paid Parental Leave are a significant expansion of the scheme, taking it to 26-weeks leave by July 2026. This expanded scheme will include four weeks of reserve leave for each parent from 2026, meaning that both parents will be encouraged to share caring responsibilities for their kids. This does send a strong signal to families and to employers that both parents, mum and dad, should be playing a role in taking on care responsibilities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also introduces concurrent leave, which means that from 2026 both parents can take four weeks of leave at the same time if they want to, giving families more flexibility in how they organise their care. This does really reflect the reality of modern families, where both parents are working and where we increasingly see that dads do want to take time off to care for their children.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know these changes will support families a whole. We also know that they will support better maternal health and recovery by giving women more supported time after giving birth. Having fairly recently gone through the experience of having babies myself, I am very aware that there is possibly no greater disruption in a woman's life, and too many Australian women do still feel like they go through that period without enough support. That is another reason why it is really important that we expand this scheme and that we make it easier for parents to take the flexible leave that will support women in this life-changing period. This will provide long-term benefits to both parents to take good chunks of leave, balance work and family life and help to embed the habits of care in the months and years that follow, for the rest of that child's life and for the household. Around 180,000 Australian families will benefit from these changes each year. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I've already said, the introduction of paid parental leave in 2011 was a game changer for Australian families. Eighteen weeks paid leave fully funded by the government was a first for many families, particularly for women in lower paid industries and in casual or part-time work. In many cases employers in those industries were not offering paid leave schemes, so the government scheme, introduced by a Labor government in 2011, was the first time those women had access to paid leave. It gave them stability and it gave support to families at a time of great change in their day-to-day lives. It did mean a parent—and it was and has been overwhelmingly the mother—could take time in those crucial early months to care for their child while still having money coming in and while continuing that connection with their workplace until they were ready to return.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That connection is important. A report on the early years of PPL in Australia found that it has improved longer term attachment to the workforce, so, rather than women simply leaving jobs because they couldn't get any paid leave, they were continuing to have a connection to that workplace. More women have been returning to the workplace 12 months after giving birth following the introduction of the scheme. Of course, that is important not just for those women individually but for all of us, in terms of workplaces and productivity in our country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The present setting for PPL is up to 20 weeks, with two weeks reserved for each parent on a 'use it or lose it' basis. From 1 July next year, this scheme will be expanded by the government by two weeks each year until PPL reaches 26 weeks in 2026. That's a full six months for families. As part of that expansion, the number of weeks reserved for each parent on the 'use it or lose it' basis will be four weeks. That then leaves 18 weeks of paid leave remaining for parents to divvy up how they like and for whatever structure works best for their family. Again, there is that element of flexibility and of recognising that, for modern families, both parents are generally trying to juggle work and both parents want to be part of caring for their children.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The changes do mean parents will be able to take up to four weeks of PPL at the same time, doubling the existing measure. With that, as I said, come the benefits of parents also being able to take leave together. This goes back to that point on maternal recovery. The extra support that comes from being able to take leave together is very important, and I do hope that that reduces some of the stress that parents find at this life-changing moment of upheaval. Single parents will also benefit from the expansion. They'll have access to the entire 26-week entitlement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Paid parental leave in this country has been a huge step forward, particularly for workplace and economic equality for women. We do know that in this country the disproportionate share of unpaid caring still falls to women, and that does have long-term consequences for their careers and for their economic security. The Grattan Institute, in a report, highlighted that care and family responsibilities account for 39 per cent of the gap between men and women. Time out of the workforce and part-time work associated with care puts women on a lower earnings trajectory because this reduces their years of job-specific experience and because flexible part-time work is generally associated with slower career progression.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, over a woman's working life, this trajectory leads to a lifetime earnings gap—which is rightly called a 'gulf'—between mothers' and fathers' earnings. We've seen data that, after a woman has a baby, her earning potential decreases, while men see no change. That's why this scheme is so important. I know that previously, for so many women, the combined effects of not having access to good paid parental leave and not having access to affordable child care have been a really huge part of why they may have decided to not participate in the workforce as much as they wanted to or as much as it would have benefited them and their family to do so. So it is important. Our government is working through this Paid Parental Leave scheme, through our changes to child care, to make that easier for families.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This reform will allow both parents to take up caring responsibilities. International evidence shows us that, when both parents take leave and take on care roles, there are long-term benefits. Rather than what we've previously called the primary caregiver—the mother, in the vast number of cases—taking all or the vast bulk of the leave, we will have what we call the secondary caregiver—the father, in most situations—taking leave as well, meaning those caring responsibilities are being shared. This will normalise the idea that dads take time off too, that they get involved from the very beginning. It will normalise that parenting is a partnership.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The evidence—particularly from overseas where there are paid parental leave schemes already in existence that provide greater support for men to take leave—shows us that, when fathers take a greater caring role from the start, there is a more even distribution of household responsibilities, not just in the immediate term but persisting throughout the child's life. That's a good thing for families and it is also a good thing for how people interact with their workplaces, because the research also shows us that dads who use paid parental leave tend to have increased job and life satisfaction and increased happiness, in having the chance to spend solo time caring for their child. It may not always feel like that at the time, when you're spending solo time caring for a child, but the data does show us that it absolutely increases people's sense of satisfaction and the sense that they can balance the responsibilities they have between work and family. That's what our government wants to see and support—both parents being a part of caring. Shared care is important, and we want workplaces and communities to reinforce and support this idea too.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're certainly not there yet. The Grattan Institute has found that Australian women do an average of two hours more unpaid work per day than men. On the other side, Australian men do two hours more of paid work. We have one of the biggest labour divisions of countries in the developed world. In 2017-18, 0.5 per cent of parents using the parental leave pay part of the scheme—the primary caregiver part—were men. Just 0.5 per cent of men were the primary caregiver. The dad and partner pay aspect of the scheme, which was almost entirely taken up by men, had only half the uptake of parental leave pay. So we're still not seeing the uptake that we would like to see. I very much hope these changes will drive an uptake in that flexibility, normalising the idea that men are able to take that leave, that both parents can take that leave, when the child is born and make use of it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The 'use it or lose it' provision is particularly important here. With these changes, each parent has at least four weeks of leave to take. Beyond that, they can use the remaining weeks in whatever combination they like. Again, the international evidence shows us that 'use it or lose it' provisions are particularly effective in encouraging fathers to take up leave. In Quebec in 2005, the year before their version of this type of 'dad leave' started, 28 per cent of fathers were taking parental leave. In 2018 this had jumped to 80 per cent. The 'use it or lose it' provision there was particularly important in making that change.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that expanding PPL means that we spend more money on the scheme, but what we get from that is an increase in GDP from increased workforce participation by women. So we all, as a community, benefit from the economic participation element that can come from this scheme. I'm also really pleased to see more and more employers taking up the challenge of providing good paid parental leave schemes and providing paid parental leave schemes that support both women and men to take time off. That is a powerful thing that employers and workplaces are normalising, and we do want to see a greater uptake of those employer led schemes. Importantly, the government scheme works closely with employer schemes to ensure that parents and families get as much support and as much time off as they can in those crucial early years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government hasn't wasted time in getting on with making these changes to paid parental leave. As I said, it was a Labor government that introduce this scheme that meant that, for the first time, Australia did have a national paid parental leave scheme. It's been a decade in between, but our government, since we have come into office, has got straight on with listening to the experts, listening to Australian families, and modernising and updating our Paid Parental Leave scheme to provide families with expanded support, to provide mothers and fathers with flexible care, to provide workplaces with care that works for their employees and to benefit us all by making sure that we are supporting Australian families at a time when we know that cost of living is a real issue, when we know that parents are making critical decisions about how they do support their families. I know that this Paid Parental Leave scheme, this expansion of the amount of support that Australian families are receiving through the Paid Parental Leave scheme, will be warmly welcomed in my community and in communities around this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We do know that it is often the time when families are looking at having a new child that they do particularly feel some of those cost-of-living pressures and they are making decisions about financial security and financial options into the future. This scheme reflects the realities of modern Australian families' lives. It reflects the fact that both parents work, that both parents want to be involved in caring, and it allows that to take place for families. This scheme will support women to remain connected to the workforce. It will do some of that work we still need to do to continue to close the gender pay gap, to continue to build women's economic participation so that they are not left at the end of their working lives with a gap in their retirement incomes. It will also, importantly, support young people and children. We do know that, when families are secure, when both parents are able to participate in caregiving, that is a much better start to life for Australian children.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm very pleased and proud to be speaking to this bill today and I'm very pleased and proud that it's a Labor government that's building on what was a very important Labor initiative in 2011 with this expanded and more flexible scheme.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to start by acknowledging the important steps that have been taken by the government and the Women's Economic Equality Taskforce. One thing that motivated a lot of voters at the last election was the very real sense that we had a government that didn't understand the concerns and priorities of women and wasn't acting on them, so I'm grateful to acknowledge the change we've seen over the last 18 months and the progress that has been made against some of those concerns.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Paid Parental Leave Amendment (More Support for Working Families) Bill 2023 is part of that progress. It is a step towards equality and equity that so many Australians wish to see, and I welcome it. It implements a further expansion of the Paid Parental Leave scheme, expanding the total leave entitlement for partnered parents to 26 weeks over the next three years, up from the current 20. It also increases the amount of reserved weeks—that is, the leave that can be taken by the second parent only—from two to four and does the same for concurrent leave.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These expansions are important and they are welcome. They will make a real improvement in the lives of many new parents, but we should not believe for a moment that these changes are sufficient. In particular, I am concerned that they will fail to change the culture in parenting in Australia, which is that it is predominantly the responsibility of the mother. This is borne out by research from the Australian Institute of Family Studies, which shows that the average number of hours worked by fathers doesn't change significantly after the birth of a child, while the situation for mothers is completely different: the number of hours they work falls by around two-thirds on average. This is one of the major drivers of the motherhood penalty, which is the 55 per cent reduction in women's earnings once they become mothers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are a country that invests heavily in educating our women and promoting an equal and equitable society, but the fact is that these efforts are not translating into the outcomes we want to see. Research by the Grattan Institute has shown that, on average, female parents do around two hours more unpaid care work per day than male parents, and male parents do two hours more paid work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's a wealth of evidence around this extremely gendered division of child care, which is driving the gender division of our workforce and our labour markets. For example, Australia's rate of primary care undertaken by a male partner is one of the lowest in the OECD. While in Sweden and Iceland the male partner is the primary carer in 40 per cent of cases, the rate in Australia is just around one or two per cent. The average in the OECD is around 18 per cent. We are incredibly gendered in how we bring up our children.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We see that this plays out in our workforce as well, because Australia has one of the highest rates of part-time work for women in the world: 37 per cent, one of the highest in the OECD, versus the OECD average of 25 per cent. Australian men, when they have children, don't really change the amount of time they work. When Australian women have children, they dramatically change their workforce participation and their economic engagement in the workplace. I've seen this personally in Wentworth amongst a whole group of different people, with parents who had had relatively similar levels of careers, aspirations, seniority and earning capacity before they had children. In the vast majority of cases where women took on the primary caring, those things dropped back significantly for them, and that persists and persists and persists.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are cultural issues in Australia that have a very significant impact on women's economic empowerment, but they also have an impact on fathers' engagement with their children, fathers' mental health and also the health of our children. We want more men to feel free to become equal or even primary caregivers, to embrace the joys of parenthood and to realise closer, more meaningful relationships with their children. We know that, if they do this, if they take up that initial significant amount of parental leave, they will have increased job satisfaction, increased happiness and a new sense of purpose in many cases. We want women, at the same time, to maintain their careers and their professional aspirations and not feel like these need to be sacrificed for motherhood. It is remarkable and regrettable that so many women make this sacrifice even when they have the higher income in the relationship.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So there is a question that I think we have when we look at this bill. Obviously, this is a very positive bill and it is a step forward, but how do we change the culture of parenting in this country? How do we make sure that parenting is about men and women and is truly a shared endeavour between parents, not a burden that continually falls on women almost solely? How do we change these norms?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One lever obviously is providing more reserved weeks. This provides a significant incentive for the second parent to take more leave and become more involved in the child's early weeks and months. The government's proposal shifts us from two weeks to four weeks, and this is welcome. But I'll be honest: I'm really concerned that this is just not far enough and that we need to move to six or eight weeks to ensure that the incentive is really significant, is properly utilised and starts to change the culture of care in our country. If we're going to achieve a culture of shared parenting, we need to ensure that dads are involved from the very beginning, because we know that the norms started when babies are first born often persist through childhood. We need shared and equal parenting to become more widely acknowledged and accepted within our community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have spoken to the government, and I appreciate that the government has further to go in this policy space. But I will continue to urge them that they need to go further to, particularly, support a culture of shared parenting and that we need to see further progress on this in the next round of paid parental leave reforms, which I hope are not going to be too far away. Thank you.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Boothby</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:05</span>):  The Paid Parental Leave Amendment (More Support for Working Families) Bill 2023 is a major investment in paid parental leave. It's the largest in more than a decade. This is the second tranche of the government's paid parental leave reform that was announced in the 2022-23 October budget. It follows the first tranche that we legislated at the start of the year to modernise the scheme to reflect how Australian families and their needs have changed over the past decade. These changes, which commenced on 1 July, give more families access to the payment, give parents more flexibility in how they take leave, and encourage parents to share care.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill expands paid parental leave to 26 weeks by: increasing the total number of weeks by two weeks each year starting on 1 July 2024 and reaching 26 weeks on 1 July 2026; increasing the number of weeks reserved for each parent on a 'use it or lose it' basis, reaching four weeks in 2026; and doubling the number of weeks that parents can take concurrently, reaching four weeks in 2025.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When we announced our paid parental leave reform in the 2022-23 October budget we tasked the Women's Economic Equality Taskforce with providing advice on the best model for paid parental leave to advance women's economic equality. We wanted to ensure that any changes we institute will continue the current growth of gender equity in Australia. The task force recommended reserving four weeks for each parent on a 'use it or lose it' basis and allowing parents to take up to four weeks of leave at the same time, and we've adopted that advice in the bill. This is important to enable both parents to bond with the child. Childhood attachment is so important to outcomes for older children and for adults.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will continue to push Australia in the right direction on women's economic equality. Starting on 1 July 2024, two additional weeks of leave will be added each year until reaching 26 weeks in 2026. Currently up to 18 weeks are available for one parent, which is usually taken by the mother, with two weeks reserved for the dad or partner. The increase to 26 weeks means that mums can access up to 22 weeks of paid parental leave—an additional month compared with the current scheme. It also doubles the period reserved for the dad or partner from two to four weeks on a 'use or lose it' basis.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Gender experts have been clear about the need for reserve portions to promote shared care and gender equality, because we know that when fathers take a greater caring role from the start it benefits mums, it benefits dads and it certainly benefits the kids—the whole family. We know that when men take parental leave it normalises it, and it will be a step to addressing the 'mummy pay gap', where women lose years and seniority in their careers because they've taken parental leave and they suddenly find themselves on the mummy track.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Crucially, this expansion provides additional support to mums after childbirth, supporting their own and their child's wellbeing while also encouraging dads and partners to take more leave. The changes in this bill send a clear message that treating parenting as an equal partnership supports gender equality. The government value both parents as carers and we want to see that reinforced in workplaces and in our communities. In that vein, this bill also provides flexibility by increasing the number of weeks parents can take paid parental leave at the same time. Single parents will have access to the full 26 weeks because all families need time to care for their new baby. The bill also includes a minor technical amendment to ensure access for fathers and partners who do not meet the work test requirements but would have if their child had not been born prematurely. This provision is already in place for birth parents. The changes will commence from 1 July 2024 and apply to births or adoptions from that date. Over 180,000 Australian families are expected to access Paid Parental Leave each year and to benefit from these changes.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The October 2022-23 budget measure was widely welcomed by a wide range of stakeholders, including the Business Council of Australia, the ACTU, Minderoo's Thrive by Five, the Parenthood and Sam Mostyn, chair of the Women's Economic Equality Taskforce. The expansion to the 26 weeks is the largest investment in the scheme since it was introduced in 2011, and this reform reflects our continued commitment to improve the lives of working families, improve outcomes for children and advance gender equality. Improving paid parental leave is a critical reform. It is critical for families, it is critical for women and it is critical for the economy. The Albanese government knows this and is acting to ensure all families are able to spend time with their children during this important stage in their lives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know paid parental leave is vital for the health and wellbeing of parents and their children. I know this because it didn't exist when I gave birth to my three boys. When I told the staff in my office that paid parental leave didn't exist when I had my children 24 years ago, they looked at me like I was from another century. It's such a normal part of life now. It is such an expected thing that you would not sacrifice your finances to have a baby. I went on unpaid parental leave at 18 weeks of gestation. As a triplet pregnancy, it was, of course, a high-risk pregnancy and, by that stage, I was having difficulty walking. So I went on unpaid parental leave at 18 weeks, which had a significant impact on the family finances. My children were born at just under 35 weeks and I went back to work part time when they were three months old. That's a long time without pay for any family. Paid parental leave would have changed my life.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is absolutely another initiative by this government to address the cost of living in ways that are not inflationary. When you have a new baby—or, in my case, three new babies—the last thing you need is financial stress on the family. In this day and age, many families have both parents working, and both parents want to keep working. For mothers to be able to remain connected to work and avoid the mummy gap and the impact of being a parent on their career is a really important step forward. Not only is it vital that parents are given time to raise their children; investing in paid parental leave also benefits our economy and is an opportunity to advance gender equality.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Before the last election, my electorate told me that they were concerned at the lack of interest the previous government had in the status of women and the things that impacted women's lives. I am pleased to say that we recently heard we have the lowest ever gender pay gap at 13 per cent. We've still got a very long way to go, but at least we are moving in the right direction. This is a government that's paying attention to that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Businesses, unions, experts and economists all understand that one of the best ways to boost productivity and participation is to provide more choice and more support for families, and that means more opportunity for women. That is why we made Paid Parental Leave reform a centrepiece of our first budget. We invested half a billion dollars to expand the scheme to six months by 2026. This is the largest investment in paid parental leave in over 10 years. It will benefit 180,000 Australian families each year and it reflects the Albanese government's commitment to improve the lives of working families, support better outcomes for children and advance women's economic equality.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Together, our changes strike an important balance of increasing support to mums, encouraging dads to take leave and providing families flexibility in how they choose to structure their care arrangements. It is critical that our paid parental leave scheme supports modern Australian families and their evolving needs. This is a scheme that is flexible, that is fair and that drives positive and social economic outcomes for both parents and their children. Crucially, our bill gives families access to more paid parental leave, provides parents options in how they take their leave entitlements and encourages them to share care to support gender equality.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is good for parents, good for kids, good for employers and good for the economy. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ryan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:15</span>):  The Greens welcome the extension of the paid parental leave scheme. Increasing the availability of leave from 18 to 26 weeks is an important step forward in ensuring that parents are adequately supported in the crucial first few months of parenthood. But why do people have to wait for another three years to get the 26-week entitlement? Women have already waited over a decade for fairer paid parental leave. This should come much sooner, and we should be moving quickly to 52 weeks paid parental leave and paying superannuation on PPL.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unions and business groups are united in their calls for a fairer PPL scheme that includes 52 weeks paid leave, superannuation and more incentives for both parents to share care from the outset, for its economic and social benefits—now, not staggered over the next three years. Australia has one of the weakest parental leave schemes globally. The experience in other countries puts beyond doubt that more equitable parental leave coupled with free child care improves women's workforce participation and helps shape the long-term sharing of care work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reintroduction of 'use it or lose it' provisions in this bill, the Paid Parental Leave Amendment (More Support for Working Families) Bill 2023, to encourage shared parenting is a welcome change. We've seen time and again in Scandinavian countries how this provision causes a huge jump in the number of dads taking leave, and that fairer sharing of care has been sustained for more than a decade. But Labor can and must do more to make the PPL scheme fairer, and immediately. The Women's Economic Equality Taskforce has again recommended that super be paid on PPL, a measure that would improve women's economic equality. But the government are making women wait to fund it, but can somehow find $313 billion for the stage 3 tax cuts. The Greens will be pushing to ensure Labor actually listens to WEET's advice, particularly regarding paying super on PPL and extending the scheme to 52 weeks.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Time out of the workforce and taking on more unpaid labour contributes to the gender pay gap and the super gap. By failing to pay super on parental leave, the government is increasing the risk that more women will retire into poverty. Women deserve fairer paid parental leave. It improves their economic security, reduces the gender pay gap and increases the likelihood of mothers returning to work. Fairer paid parental leave is a no-brainer that benefits everyone—parents, children and the economy. If we scrap the stage 3 tax cuts, we can easily afford it.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr NEUMANN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Blair</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:18</span>):  I rise to support the Paid Parental Leave Amendment (More Support for Working Families) Bill 2023. We're the first government in Australia's history with a majority of women in our ranks. As the finance minister and Minister for Women has often said, we know equality for women is not just an add-on or a nice-to-have; it's absolutely crucial for our economic prosperity. That's why, in our first budget last year, we expanded the paid parental leave scheme and made it more generous.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On 1 July Australians began to benefit from these reforms. This was the biggest expansion to paid parental leave since its creation, with the government investing more than $530 million to progressively scale up the scheme, reaching six months paid leave in 2026. For two-parent families, a portion of this leave will be reserved for each parent, to encourage families to share caring responsibilities. Again, this goes beyond taking a bit of pressure off household budgets; this is about greater equality and greater security for Australian women and about dads doing their bit. It goes to the PPP framework of population, participation and productivity. That's what makes it more than good social policy; it's good economic reform as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill implements the second tranche of our significant expansion of paid parental leave, first announced in last year's October budget, increasing the scheme to 26 weeks by July 2026. It's about the Albanese government keeping its commitment to improving the lives of Australian working families. With this legislation, the government is committed to providing each parent four weeks of reserve leave from July 2026, when the full scheme is implemented, which will encourage shared care and send a strong signal that both parents play a key role in caring for children. We're increasing the amount of weeks reserved for each parent on a 'use it or lose it' basis, reaching four weeks in 2026.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill introduces concurrent leave, meaning that, from 2026, both parents can take four weeks leave at the same time if they choose to do so, providing flexibility for families in how they arrange their care. Families come in different shapes and forms and have different needs and aspirations and different work arrangements, so that's very important. It also aids maternal health recovery, providing the birth parent with extra support as they recover from childbirth, and it's been shown to reduce parental stress, so it's good for mental health as well. It's good for long-term health and wellbeing for both children and parents.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These changes reflect the additional advice on PPL sought by the government from the Women's Economic Equality Taskforce and represent the largest investment in paid parental leave since the scheme was first introduced in 2011 by the Gillard Labor government; it's always a Labor government that does these types of things. We've responded to sustained calls from a wide range of stakeholders to improve and expand the scheme, particularly to encourage shared care.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill introduces a minor technical amendment to ensure access for fathers and partners who don't meet the work test requirements but would have if their child had not been born prematurely. The provision is already in place for birth parents. Importantly, this investment will increase support for both birth parents and partners. Up to 22 weeks of leave will be available for one parent, up from 18 weeks, with four weeks reserved for the other parent, up from two weeks. Single parents can access the full entitlement. As well as increasing the reserved period to encourage shared care, which is critical for women's economic equality, the bill also gives families more flexibility by doubling the period parents can take concurrently from two to four weeks. Altogether, this legislation delivers more support for working families, improves outcomes for children and advances gender equality. The bill follows changes commenced from 1 July 2023 to make the scheme more accessible, flexible and gender equitable. These important structural changes lay a foundation for our expansion of the scheme to 26 weeks.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">From the Jobs and Skills Summit and the employment white paper, the government has heard loud and clear that support for families to balance care is critical to ensuring women's long-term economic equality. In fact, this was one of the strongest points of consensus and one of the clearest calls for action from the Jobs and Skills Summit in September last year. Businesses, unions, experts and economists were all on a unity ticket on this. They all understand that one of the best ways to boost productivity and participation across the economy is to provide more choice and more support for families and more opportunities for women. It ticks all the boxes under the PPP framework. There's also extensive research—for example, from the Grattan Institute and Equity Economics—showing that boosting women's labour supply or workforce participation is one of the best ways to increase GDP.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government has listened, consulted and taken action to deliver Australian families the kind of support they need to boost productivity, boosting the economy and increasing the time parents have with their newborns. Indeed, the October 2022-23 budget measure was welcomed by a huge cross-section of stakeholders—the Business Council, the ACTU, Thrive by Five, the Parenthood and the chair of the Women's Economic Equality Taskforce, Sam Mostyn.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that good women's policy is good economic policy. Women will tell you that. They've been telling men that for years. This investment is promoting parenting and an equal partnership while boosting the economy. This is all about making sure that every family has more choice, better security and more support.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The changes to the scheme better address the needs of families and provide greater security. Roughly 180,000 families who receive paid parental leave each year will benefit from a more generous scheme that supports maternal health and wellbeing and encourages dads and partners to take leave.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's estimated that about 4,300 people would now gain access to the scheme who would be ineligible under the current arrangements. Not only that, this will help families to balance work and care. It's a double dividend for the Australian economy. It strikes a balance between supporting families' greater gender equality and supporting workforce participation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Subject to the passage of this bill, two weeks of additional payments will be made from 1 July 2024, applying to births or adoptions from that day, increasing the overall length of paid parental leave by six weeks by July 2026. Again, the bill increases the number of weeks reserved for each parent to four weeks in order to encourage the sharing of care and household responsibilities. The rest of the 18 weeks can be split in any way people choose. They can choose to use it concurrently—by both parents at the same time—for up to four weeks. They've tried to make this as flexible as possible.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill increases the number of weeks people can take and increases flexibility, and that's a big improvement. I think the impact firstly on mums and dads being able to take time off from work for the birth of a baby is extremely important, and, with the reserved period as well, we're going to see an increase in the sharing of caring responsibilities in households. I think that's extremely important. Children need to know that dads and partners, not just mums, are the ones involved in the caring of them from their time of birth.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another key objective of the scheme is to encourage partners and fathers to take leave, and that in turn helps balance work and family life. The changes in the bill send a clear message that the government supports shared care. We want to see that reinforced in workplaces and across our communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's worth noting the taxpayer funded Paid Parental Leave scheme is a minimum entitlement designed to complement employer provided leave, therefore it doesn't act in substitution—it's a minimum entitlement. And we're encouraging employers and employees, unions and businesses to look at a more generous scheme on top of it. It's the minimum entitlement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Data collected by Workplace Gender Equality Agency shows the portion of businesses providing their own paid parental leave has increased over the last decade. This positive trend demonstrates employers increasingly see themselves as having a role alongside government in providing paid parental leave. We want to see that continue in the future. We definitely want to see that continue. It's important we have a paid parental leave scheme that complements other paid parental schemes offered by numbers of employers, and that's why this bill is so important.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Look at the OECD—and we always compare ourselves to the OECD—Australia is historically towards the bottom in terms of support for paid parental leave. This is not only to do with child care; we need to increase women's participation through this measure so they can stay in the workforce and build productivity and build their living standards.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On a related note, it was great to see reports today that Australia's average gender pay gap, as measured by the Workplace Gender Equality Agency, fell by 1.1 per cent and points to a new low of 21.7 per cent over 12 months to March. Since coming to office, we've worked hard to improve women's economic equality in Australia, and it's encouraging to see this reduction in the gender pay gap.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Earlier this year we passed legislation to improve transparency on gender pay gap reporting to accelerate the closing of the pay gap and keep a spotlight on the issue. But we also know that to close the gender pay gap we need to address gender segregation in the workplace and ensure caring responsibilities are shared within families, and that's why this bill is important. That's where PPL and the measure in this bill will go a long way in encouraging more sharing of care and household responsibilities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Paid parental leave is another great reform introduced by Labor. Very little happened in this space in the last decade after the Gillard government introduced it. Then, in our first budget, we announced the change. We were legislating an increase from 20 weeks to 26 weeks so parents could have more time off after the birth of their child. That's a very significant increase. We think this helps a lot of families to better deal with cost-of-living pressures as well as having extra weeks off that are paid and will be of great assistance. It's an investment of $1.2 billion over five years. Of course, it benefits the broader economy in terms of workforce participation, and the multiplier effect, if you like—if you're a Keynesian like me—will be much greater than that.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a result of these reforms, from 2026-27 the government's total investment in PPL will be around $4.4 billion a year. This is a significant investment that reflects the government's commitment to better outcomes for families and advancing economic equality for women. I know a lot of working families with young children in my electorate will benefit hugely from this. In the 2021-22 financial year, we saw the number of families grew, and it will grow to 2,625 by 2022-23.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms WATSON-BROWN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ryan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:30</span>):  As we barrel towards the end of 2023, I wish every Australian had the resources to have a happy festive season, but I'm afraid that will not be the case. I've been an MP in this place for 18 months. I arrived here in the House hoping, as did many Australians, that this new government would make the comprehensive and urgent change we need for a safe and just future for all Australians. I'm afraid I've been disappointed, and I'm not the only one. Many of my Ryan constituents say they are too.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've certainly witnessed some deeply disappointing and indeed disturbing things here in this place. I've seen Labor opening new coal and gas mines in a climate crisis, making the cost-of-living crisis worse by refusing to crack down on corporate profiteering and price gouging, and having to be dragged kicking and screaming to actually practically start to address the housing crisis. The sitting week in October after the Voice vote failed was particularly toxic. Coalition MPs gave themselves licence to spout what I felt was the most appalling racist commentary. Then, with Israel and Hamas, the bellicose warmongering escalated on both sides of this House. I thought I couldn't be shocked anymore—not so. The inhumanity, the venality, the absence of proper, reasoned debate has, yes, shocked me. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last sitting week was quite loathsome again. We sat here late into the night to facilitate the ramming through of draconian retrograde immigration legislation. The High Court ruled that mandatory detention was illegal, and what did Labor do? Labor quickly wrote extraordinary new anti-refugee laws in a deal with the devil in exchange for passing them through the parliament in a single day. They rammed through legislation to decriminalise their own—it has to be said, and it has been said by some—criminality. This is their attempt to legalise and institutionalise cruelty. These powers are nothing less than Orwellian. I was shocked to see Labor and the coalition line up together on that side of the chamber, colluding to ram through these ill-considered punitive laws.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I had the same level of shock and shame yesterday, with Labor coming back to this place with hastily drafted immigration legislation to apparently patch up the botches of that earlier, rushed legislation. Labor had learnt nothing from that previous week's sitting, giving the opposition leader the opening to drive again a racist narrative demonising refugees and spreading misinformation. We had virtually no time to review, to scrutinise or to consider this new legislation, first shown to us in the morning, before being again forced to a rushed vote on it that very evening. Shame! This sort of cavalier and cruel behaviour doesn't go unnoticed by the electorate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the Prime Minister's <span style="font-style:italic;">Tampa</span> moment. The opposition leader and the media have confected an emergency, and Labor has predictably collapsed under the pressure, just as they did with <span style="font-style:italic;">Tampa</span>—a disgraceful capitulation which undermines key principles of our democracy. As the leader of the Greens said yesterday, we're dealing with some of the most serious issues that confront this parliament: questions of liberty, of the rule of law, of the Constitution, of the separation of powers. Labor's draconian actions and laws have made it impossible for us elected representatives to have a sober discussion to properly debate momentous laws and decisions on behalf of the Australian people—in this case, to do with what the High Court can and can't do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, yes, there is disappointment and a bit of shame but a bit of festive season hope. We the Greens are here to stand up for all those Australians so cruelly ignored and disadvantaged by both retrograde legislation and inaction on the climate crisis, the housing crisis and the cost-of-living crisis. The community sees through it, as evidenced in the waning popularity of both government and opposition. Only one-third of Australia voted for the government last time—they squeaked in—and one-third voted for the crossbench. When I arrived here 18 months ago, a very senior politician said to me: 'Congratulations on your win, Elizabeth. I think we're witnessing the end of the two-party system.' If that's what it takes to bring some heart, some compassion, some conscience, some actual responsibility to act in the interests of all Australians, I say bring it on.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Swan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:35</span>):  "All of us, regardless of race, culture or gender, share a strong identity as Australians wanting to build a common, tolerant and prosperous future together." These were the words of Senator Patrick Dodson seven years ago, in his maiden speech. Today he announced his retirement. These words remain powerful today. Pursuing peace over conflict, he is fondly regarded as the father of reconciliation. He has inspired a generation with his spirit of healing and forgiveness. Sometimes we come across giants in our lives, and occasionally these giants are elected to our parliament. He will be greatly missed. I stand here to thank him for his service. His wisdom throughout his career should continue to guide us in this place. Reconciliation with our First Nations people will make Australia whole. As a nation, we need to understand our past so we can reconcile it with the present to simply build a better future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia, with its rich tapestry of cultures, traditions and landscapes bears the weight of a troubled history. It's a past marked by dispossession, discrimination and an attempted erosion of Indigenous culture. The mistreatment of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, the impact of policies like the forced removal of children, and the denial of basic rights are painful chapters in our shared history. Senator Dodson, in his first speech, talked about how he, as a child, hid in the long grass in Katherine, watching his friends being taken. This is something that would be heart-wrenching for a mother to watch. I cannot imagine what it would be like for a child to watch this. Today we must confront this history with humility. We must acknowledge the deep scars and we must follow in the footsteps of Senator Dodson to commit ourselves to a path of reconciliation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my mind, this goes to the core of what it means to be Australian. It's about a fair go but it's also about belonging. Good friends make commitments to healing historical wounds. This is also something that mature countries do. This is why I was proud to stand shoulder to shoulder with Senator Dodson in the heart of Swan, at Curtin University, and campaign on the Voice referendum. While we didn't achieve the outcome that we were hoping for, I know that all of Australia has now seen the richness of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander culture. It is amazing that we are part of the world's oldest continuous culture, and this is a source of pride for all Australians. But what we also saw was social disadvantage being highlighted to all Australians. The thing that I think Australia is united on is that the gap is unacceptable, and we must work together to close it. During the campaign, I saw a grassroots community movement in my electorate, Vic Park for the Voice, who threw their heart and soul into the campaign. We will not rest until we close the gap.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the things that I have seen post-referendum is the way that children play change-maker roles. Knowledge is power, and education is a tool to share power. That's something that we must all work on together. Local Salter Point student Ethan Widjaja won the national Indigenous history award this week. He explored the importance of how Indigenous storytellers are reclaiming the space from the colonial tradition. These are our leaders of the future and will be the architects of a fair and just future for Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we navigate this path forward, let us be guided by the spirit and leadership of Senator Dodson. These are the principles of justice, respect and equality. The way that I have to reconcile the future is that, while we didn't achieve constitutional recognition in the referendum, I believe in a future where we will achieve this. The history books will look back, and I am confident that Senator Dodson played an important role in this. Thank you so much for your service.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">O'Connor</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:40</span>):  Delivering first-class health care in the bush is always a challenge and, with an electorate spanning over 1.1 million square kilometres of regional, rural and remote Western Australia, O'Connor has had its share of health hits and misses in 2023. First a hit: last Tuesday I was privileged to speak, along with the assistant minister, who is here with us tonight, at the opening of the Goldfields University Department of Rural Health, a satellite campus of Curtin University co-located in the legendary WA School of Mines, in Kalgoorlie. This opening was a culmination of many years of lobbying by Curtin University, in particular by Professor Helen McCutcheon, Pro Vice-Chancellor, Health Sciences, and Vice-Chancellor Harlene Hayne. I'm proud to have played a small role in securing $13 million for Curtin through the Rural Health Multidisciplinary Training Program. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Goldfields UDRH currently hosts metropolitan students for residential placements in nursing and occupational therapy and supports Goldfields allied health students in realising their dreams of a tertiary education close to home and community. The UDRH will also play a critical role in attracting health professionals to the Goldfields and growing a strong and capable local allied health workforce. I commend Curtin University and their project partners, the Royal Flying Doctor Service of Australia (Western Operations) and the WA Country Health Service, who together with Bega Garnbirringu Aboriginal health service are embarking on a new journey in health education provision for the greater Goldfields.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I take this opportunity to congratulate Professor Helen McCutcheon on her retirement and thank her for seeing this project through to fruition. Helen, I hope you can retire secure in the legacy of an allied healthcare training pipeline that will benefit the Goldfields for a long time into the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now to a miss: the northern Goldfields town of Laverton is home to one of the most remote hospitals in O'Connor and the country. It services the town and many mine sites, pastoral stations and remote Aboriginal communities between Laverton and the tri-state border. On 3 April 2019, the coalition government committed $16.8 million to rebuild Laverton Hospital, which was no longer fit for purpose. Over four years later, not even a single sod has been turned, and the WA Labor government continues to make excuses for why this federal funding has not been spent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On ABC Radio recently, Laverton Shire President Patrick Hill asked Premier Cook directly when exactly this hospital would be built. Premier Cook acknowledged that the project had been delayed under his watch as health minister in the name of budget repair, and the shire had been very understanding at that time. Now the excuse is that they can't find a tenderer, and the budget has apparently blown out to over $30 million. But, despite the shire tipping in an extra $4 million, the project remains at a standstill. Tonight I urge Premier Cook to make good on his long-overdue commitment to deliver a much-needed hospital service to Laverton and the community beyond.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another miss: a headspace for the Warren-Blackwood region was promised by the coalition government back in 2022 after years of lobbying by the Blackwood Youth Action group, chaired by Dr Sarah Youngson. This Labor government did not honour that promise, despite clear indications that the communities of the region were in crisis, with youth suicide rates in Manjimup up to 50 per cent higher than the state average. The WA Primary Health Alliance recognised the unmet need for local youth mental health services, and BYA demonstrated the professional capacity in the region to support a headspace. I joined BYA in making separate appeals to Minister Butler, who, despite commending BYA on their terrific work, did not offer funding certainty—only platitudes that their youth in crisis could access eheadspace or travel over 120 kilometres to the nearest face-to-face headspace. I urge Minister Butler to pay more than just lip service to BYA and put the Warren-Blackwood region on a priority list for mental health funding before young lives are tragically lost.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I close with a mixed hit and miss. Nurse practitioners are an amazing asset to the medical profession, being able to consult, diagnose, prescribe and write referrals. The Wheatbelt Shire of Westonia has an accomplished, popular and award-winning local nurse practitioner who recently secured a place through the federal government nurse practitioner pilot program. Unfortunately, despite providing medical premises, a regular stipend and monthly support from a visiting doctor, the Shire of Westonia has not secured their bid to be a provider. Instead, their nurse practitioner has been matched with an Aboriginal health service 250 kilometres away in the Goldfields. This nonsensical mismatch will see the shire lose a valued medical practitioner after 11 years of faithful service to her community. I once again call on Minister Butler to address how this pilot can better meet the needs of communities who don't have a doctor but do want to support the services of their capable nurse practitioner.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fraser</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:45</span>):  I rise to pay tribute to Jacob Thang, a leader of the local Chin community, which is a persecuted minority in Myanmar. Jacob arrived in Melbourne 11 years ago with his wife and toddler daughter, speaking not a word of English. He has since made an extraordinary contribution to his new community. This culminated in the Leadership Award at the 2023 Victorian Refugee Awards for his tireless work in supporting the Chin community in Melbourne's west and his community in Myanmar.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Jacob founded Chin-Myanmar Community Care, a not-for-profit that provides employment, education and training support, settlement assistance, advocacy, referral advice and more. Chin-Myanmar Community Care also runs a candle-making factory in partnership with Kenshi Life Changing Candles and reinvests all the profits back into the community. Jacob is also the CEO of the social enterprise AusChin Group, a garden, maintenance and landscaping company that won the Innovation Award in last month's 2023 We Are Brimbank Awards. The idea for the landscaping company was sparked after he and a handful of members of the Chin community took part in a Brotherhood of St Laurence sponsored program, which included pre-employment training and work experience with Maribyrnong Council's parks and gardens unit at the Maidstone Community Centre. After it finished, a council officer volunteered to mentor the men and develop a business plan for a garden maintenance business. A crowdfunding campaign provided some seed money for the new social enterprise. Jacob also worked night shifts in a factory for 12 months while gardening during the day to really get the business off the ground.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The company now employs 32 people, most of whom are from the Chin community. It also donates half of its profits to Chin-Myanmar Community Care to further support the community. Another focus of Chin-Myanmar Community Care is on providing humanitarian aid to the camps for internally displaced people in Mizoram, a state in India, and the Chin state of Myanmar. Thanks to profits from the sale of Kenshi Life Changing Candles, 15 tonnes of rice and two tonnes of cooking oil, some four months supply, are now on their way to Jacob's village. Before being recognised as a refugee, Jacob spent more than eight years in New Delhi working 12-hour shifts in a garment factory. To top it all off, Kenshi Life Changing Candles will feature in Parliament House's gift shop as part of the National Showcase, which launches on Thursday. I've already bought one this week. Locally made products from Victoria are the first to be featured in the National Showcase. Congratulations, Jacob, for all your hard work and all the support you and your colleagues at Chin-Myanmar Community Care provide for the community.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On another issue: a spaceship crashing on earth, life forms visiting from outer space, checks of radiation levels, conversations in alien speak and even some quick-thinking improvisational skills—<span style="font-style:italic;">I</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ntergalactic </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Outbreak</span>, a story performed by students at Sunshine North Primary School, was funny, clever, creative and imaginative. All these attributes and many more are developed in students thanks to the involvement of 100 Story Building, which partners with schools in Melbourne's west to create story hubs. In these imaginative spaces, students can take creative risks and teachers can support this creativity, building students' literacy skills and confidence. Story hub schools show significant improvements in literacy levels, better curriculum outcomes, greater student engagement and increased teacher and student wellbeing. Last week, I attended the launch of 100 Story Building's newest hub at Sunshine North Primary School in conjunction with Sunshine College.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to pay tribute to all of the principals, teachers and other school leaders who made this possible through their hard work over a very long period of time. Led by its passionate CEO, Susan Kukucka, the social enterprise offers programs that focus primarily on young people from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds and those who experience socioeconomic disadvantage. Since opening in Footscray 10 years ago, 100 Story Building has reached more than 45,000 young people, aged from five to 18, and has substantially reduced educational inequality, particularly in the area of creativity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Story hubs demonstrate the success that can be achieved when schools and philanthropic and community partners band together to tackle common challenges in under-resourced schools, and promise to reshape the landscape of education and creativity in the local communities taking part. They allow 100 Story Building to reach many more students than if they had to rely upon just their Footscray building, giving an opportunity to many more students who may not be able to travel easily. Congratulations to 100 Story Building, to the school communities that they partner with and to all of the amazing kids that bring this wonderful program to life. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Casey</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:50</span>):  What makes our region such a great place isn't just the beauty of the hills, the plains of the valley and the Upper Yarra; it's the people—the people who work hard every day to make our community even stronger. Our community has such a strong spirit of volunteerism, and tonight I wish to pay tribute to our volunteer firefighters, our first responders. They are ready to serve over the summer break when we'll be enjoying our Christmas lunch or New Year celebrations. They are ready to protect our community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The fire danger period commences in the Yarra ranges at 1 am on Monday 18 December. After that time, there will be no burning off despite weather conditions on the day. Now is the time to play your part and prepare your property ahead of the fire season. I urge everyone to follow those rules and help our responders in this predicted dangerous summer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to pay tribute to all the volunteers at the 30 fire brigades across Casey. Many have already been up to Queensland to support our Queensland friends with the fires that they've had. It's important that they are all acknowledged and recognised for the work that they do. So to those brigades at Belgrave, Belgrave Heights and Belgrave South, Clematis, Kallista-The Patch, Kalorama and Mount Dandenong, Macclesfield, Menzies Creek, Monbulk, Narre Warren East, Olinda, Sassafras-Ferny Creek, Selby and Upwey: thank you for everything you do making sure the Dandenongs are kept safe not just from fires but also, as we know, from storms and other emergencies, as you did so well in June 2021.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To Chirnside Park, Lilydale, Montrose, Mooroolbark and Mount Evelyn: thank you for the work you do keeping our community safe. To Badger Creek, Coldstream, Dixons Creek, Gruyere, Healesville, Hillcrest, Hoddles Creek, Little Yarra, Seville, Silvan, Wandin, Warburton, Wesburn-Millgrove, Yarra Glen, Yarra Junction, Yellingbo and Reefton: thank you for protecting the Upper Yarra and the Yarra Valley, facing many of the unique challenges we have in our community.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Such great people volunteer their time. I recently had the opportunity to read a post from the Badger Creek fire brigade, which really sums up the spirit of all our volunteers. I want to take their words, share them tonight and thank them again for their support. This is their post:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">People often say to me "I drove past the station Sunday and the team were washing the trucks, why do you wash them so often, people don't care if a clean or dirty truck turns up to a fire" I always reply with the following: If you saw us why didn't you stop and help, or stop for a coffee?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Then I go on to say "the truck with the red number plate is owned by CFA and entrusted to us to use and look after, the government gives CFA money for our trucks, the government gets its money from tax payers, so we like to look after it for our taxpayers. The truck with the blue plates is a vehicle that the brigade purchased, the funds were donated to us by our community, so we like to keep the community asset looking it's best for our community."</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It's also about pride. We at Badger Creek take pride in our equipment, if we look after what we have, it will last longer and will look after us when we need it most. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">So when you drive past our station and see us looking after our trucks and equipment, that is why we do it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">But always feel free to stop and say hi, have a coffee with us and ask as many questions as you like, from making a fire plan to cleaning up your property, or ask one of us about why we volunteer our time to fight fires!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">You, our community, are always welcome at the station!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are wonderful words from the Badger Creek CFA. I want to finish by again thanking those in the CFA. They volunteer their time to help our community. They go into dangerous situations to keep us safe.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to pay tribute to the families of the CFA volunteers. They spend many Sundays and many a time away from their families. Recently, at the Healesville CFA, I caught up with a friend of mine, Rowan, whom I've known for over 20 years. His dad was awarded a significant national medal of service at the brigade, and he talked about the time, as a young child, he spent away from his dad. But he knew that was in service to his community. So I want to pay tribute to all of our volunteers in the CFA and all of their families, who sacrifice so much for our community.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyons</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:55</span>):  When I was looking to write a speech reviewing 2023, I saw that the global headlines have, sadly, brought pain and despair on a daily basis. Russia's war on Ukraine continues and the harrowing stories of the Israel-Hamas conflict continue to fill the pages of our newspapers, and they are on repeat on 24-hour news channels. Our world is suffering economic uncertainty, and strategic flux continues to affect hundreds of millions. Here at home, we've also felt the global economic aftershocks, with cost-of-living pressures continuing to challenge Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But with all the trouble in the world we also have many reasons to be thankful. I'd like to mention some award-winning Tasmanians who are working wonders to help their community at home. The Tasmanian Young Achiever Awards took place in May. Young Tasmanian Isabella Dewar from Burnie is a certified karate instructor at just 16. She was recognised for offering free self-defence classes to kids and adults who have been bullied. Gavin Yi Feng Quek, aged 25, of North Hobart is a dentist who is helping improve oral health awareness among Tasmanians. He volunteers with the Red Cross's bicultural health program, educating refugees on oral health. Kitana Mansell, aged 22, of Risdon Cove is strengthening her community by sharing cultural knowledge. A proud Palawa woman, Kitana manages Palawa Kipli, the first Tasmanian Aboriginal food business.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tasmanian business The Udder Way was acknowledged for its work in sustainability at the Tasmanian Community Achievement Awards. It is eliminating the need for single-use plastics in the dairy farming industry. In my own electorate, Cressy's Tasmanian Quality Meats was named Tasmanian exporter of the year earlier this month and is a national finalist in this year's Australian Export Awards, taking place right here in the parliament in the Great Hall on Thursday evening. It's one of many businesses in my electorate showcasing the very best Tasmanian produce on the world stage. This family-run business processes quality Tasmanian lamb, mutton and veal Australia-wide and for numerous international markets. I look forward to catching up with them on Thursday.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd also like to acknowledge Sea Forest from being named a finalist in the prodigious Earthshot Prize for 2023. Based at Triabunna on Tasmania's east coast, Sea Forest is dedicated to fighting climate change by being the first in the world to cultivate <span style="font-style:italic;">Asparagopsis</span> at a commercial scale and by producing livestock supplements. I'm thrilled that, as a finalist for the Fix Our Climate Earthshot Prize, the revolutionary work of Sam and the team at Sea Forest is being recognised globally.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many of the vineyards in Lyons have also had international success. I don't think it's well known outside Tasmania that it's a fantastic place for wine, but it is. Tolpuddle vineyard, for example, took out the Australian red wine, the Australian red trophy and the Australian pinot noir trophy, along with a gold medal at the International Wine Challenge in London earlier this year. I'm going to run out of time, so I can't name all the others, but there's Spring Vale, Stefano Lubiana, Bream Creek, Meadowbank, Freycinet and others that have all won big awards, and there's no way I'll have time to mention the many distilleries across Lyons that are winning international awards; I've simply run out of time. Many across my electorate are absolutely smashing it. We're really showing the Scots how to distil whiskey. I know that's a controversial comment, but it's true.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to mention Stephanie Trethewey, who is from the Dunorlan. She was named the 2024 Tasmanian Australian of the Year. She's a rural women's advocate and founder of the nationwide charity Motherland, which does great work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to end my speech by acknowledging three Tasmanians whom we've lost: Lindsay Birch, Lyn Rigby and Rhonda Foster from Bagdad, who died just this week. All three of them were tireless volunteers for their clubs and their communities. They were just amazing people. They illustrate the volunteering spirit that is found right across my electorate. There are many wonderful people who've left us this year whom I don't have time to name, but those three in particular stand out to me. They shared a passion for volunteering and a deep sense of community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To all the people who help keep us safe—the police; the SES; the water rescuers; the firies; the ambos; the defence services, cadets and reserves; the volunteer and service organisations; the food banks; the folk who extend a helping hand or a comforting word—I say thank you from the bottom of my heart for your dedication to community. I'm sure I share the wishes of the parliament. In case I don't get to speak again before the House rises for the year, a very merry Christmas and a happy and safe new year to you all.</span>

Women are dying as a result of domestic and family violence at catastrophic levels in Australia—one woman per week. No part of Australia is untouched by this catastrophe, including the division of Warringah. According to the New South Wales Bureau of Crime Statistics and Research, in the year to June 2023, there were 254 domestic violence related assault offences in the Northern Beaches. This was statistically similar to the previous year. It's not good enough. This is a crisis.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Four days ago I attended a fundraiser for the Northern Beaches Domestic Violence Network to acknowledge and raise money for the 32 organisations in my community supporting victims of domestic violence and to commence the 16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence. During the evening, we held a vigil for the 53 women killed this year by partners. It was a sobering and harrowing but necessary reflection. Since that event, Catiuscia Machado was allegedly murdered by her partner. According to the count by Destroy the Joint, she was the 54th woman killed this year. Whilst intimate partner violence also impacts men, it overwhelmingly impacts women.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to acknowledge the recipients of the community awards from the Northern Beaches Domestic Violence Network—their work and support is essential: the Women's Domestic Violence Court Advocacy Services; Todd Darvas from Horizons Family Law for the Legal Support Award; Gabrielle Morrissey from Women and Children First for the Support and Rights Award; Link Wentworth Housing for the Community Organisation Award; Jo Kemp from Street Side Medics for the Service to Others Award; Robyn Stowe from WDVCAS for the Leadership Award; and Rachael Leah Jackson and Narelle Hand from the Northern Beaches Women's Shelter—absolute powerhouses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to do more and move faster, with more urgency about what works on this issue. I pressed the Prime Minister in question time to act with more urgency. Staying Home Leaving Violence is a program run by the New South Wales state government. The Northern Beaches Women's Shelter and Women and Children First are calling for this program to also be introduced to the Northern Beaches. I call on the federal government to look at such programs and implement them more broadly, nationally.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to ensure that women and children escaping domestic violence have somewhere to live. The current system puts them, not the perpetrators, at risk of homelessness. It needs to be reversed. This program flips the burden of leaving the home from the victim to the alleged perpetrator, where it is appropriate. It's particularly important in my electorate, where housing is so expensive and difficult to come by. I urge the government to do more.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Parramatta</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:03</span>):  A few weeks ago I was privileged to visit the local Rheem manufacturing facility in my electorate on the occasion of its 70th anniversary. Today, Rheem is one of Australia's largest manufacturers of household water heaters. Once owned by BHP, the company has grown and expanded from its first Melbourne facility in 1936 and its first Sydney site in 1939 to now several locations across Victoria and New South Wales.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When the factory opened in Rydalmere in 1953, Parramatta was a manufacturing powerhouse. The Rheem factory provided substantial employment, making up more than a third of all the manufacturing jobs in Parramatta at the time. The factory helped strengthen Parramatta's contribution as an industrial powerhouse, sharing the hub with other local manufacturers like Meggitt, Reckitt &amp; Colman and the Australian Cream Tartar Company. As Parramatta has continued to develop into the vibrant business and cultural hub that we know today, Rheem has always been there. It saw the opening of Westmead Hospital and Westfield Parramatta in the 1970s. It saw the introduction of the iconic RiverCat ferries in 1993. I'm confident that, as Parramatta continues to grow, the Rydalmere factory will continue its lineage as an advanced precinct for local manufacturing. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since the factory opened 70 years ago, Rheem has touched the lives of many, including my family. My dad began his working life at the factory in 1961. As a child growing up, I remember my family waiting eagerly at the factory car park when my mum would pick him up from work. As a young process engineer, it was his job to keep production flowing—achieving efficiencies and helping establish new products. Dad remembers the arrival in the late 1960s of a big new IBM mainframe plonked in the middle of a huge empty room. No-one knew how to use it or what to use it for, so dad tried his best, picking up some elementary computing, as he managed the new machine.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My father's story at that factory is one of many, and I'd like to congratulate the workers and the leadership team who work at the factory today, as well as all of those who've shared in its 70-year history. Rheem is an iconic local institution. It boasts a renowned history in Parramatta's industrial heritage, and it is a leading light in both Australian and Western Sydney manufacturing. I look forward to visiting the factory again and celebrating many milestones in the future.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">O'Connor</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:06</span>):  I rise today to congratulate all mayors, shire presidents and councillors across O'Connor who were elected at last month's WA local government elections. I also thank outgoing council members for the service that they have provided to their communities. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The 1.1-million-square-kilometre division of O'Connor encompasses more local government electorates than any other federal electorate—57 in all. Every one of those LGAs is a rural, regional or remote one, and they differ markedly in area and population, from the verdant valleys of Nannup in WA's south-west to the shire of Ngaanyatjarraku in the desert lands that abut the Northern Territory. I greatly value the contribution of all local governments across O'Connor. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the electorate's five most populous LGAs—Albany, Kalgoorlie, Esperance, Manjimup and Collie—the recent council elections saw a changing of the guard, from retiring leaders of long standing to a new crop of mayors and shire presidents, who all have experience serving on their councils. In Albany, Mayor Dennis Wellington retired after 12 years at the helm, and Greg Stocks, a former deputy mayor, was elected to succeed him. After eight years as mayor of Kalgoorlie-Boulder, John Bowler retired, and his deputy, Glenn Wilson, was elected to lead that great inland city of gold. In Esperance, Ian Mickel retired after 19 years all up as shire president, and his deputy, Ron Chambers, has been elected to the position. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Manjimup, shire president Paul Omodei retired after a decade in the job over three separate terms. Between his second and third term, Councillor Omodei had a distinguished political career, including as leader of the Western Australian Liberal Party. Councillor Omodei will serve out his remaining two years as a shire councillor, alongside Donelle Buegge, who has been on the council for the past two years and has been elected to succeed Councillor Omodei as shire president. In Collie, Sarah Stanley retired after six years as shire president. Her deputy, Ian Miffling, has been elected to the shire's top political position. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">People say, and I agree, that 'all politics is local'. That being the case, no politics is more local—nor often more vocal—than local council politics. I therefore trust that, after their busy campaigns ahead of the recent local elections, all candidates can find time to relax with their families during the upcoming Christmas break. From Wiluna in the north to Walpole in the south of my electorate, and from Warakurna in the east to Wandering in the west, I wish every one of my constituents a safe and happy Christmas. Finally, with an eye to the new year, I look forward, like the council representatives in your town, shire or city do, to again going in to bat for you in 2024 in the House of Representatives.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Higgins</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:08</span>):  Turning 'never again' into action is the baton passed down to us as post-Holocaust generations. The Jewish people are rightly seen as the custodians of Holocaust remembrance, research and education. But this cannot be taken as a free pass for the rest of us. This dark chapter and its aftershocks belong to humanity—to each and every one of us, Jewish or not. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Time and again, Holocaust survivors emphasise the importance of education. For many it has been their life's mission, which is why they have devoted their lives to telling and retelling their stories—testimonies that breathe life into the incomprehensible statistics. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For 15 years, the Gandel Foundation has taken Australian teachers on an immersive experience to Yad Vashem, the world Holocaust Remembrance Centre in Israel, where they craft lesson plans tailored to their communities. With titles like 'Return to life', 'Call them by their names' and 'Courage to care', as well as 'The space between', students learn how to be modern-day upstanders. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The children return home to teach their parents. This is the force multiplier in action. And what do they learn? That the road to death camps was cultivated by populism, demagoguery, discrimination, dehumanisation, misinformation and disinformation, and scapegoating. They are universal themes—not unique to the Holocaust. They are red flags that we can only recognise if we have an eye that has been trained on the past. At an annual ceremony, the teachers describe their journey and outcome, but the most striking thing was their calibre: thoughtful, articulate and commanding. It is only through education that we become kinder, wiser and able to critically unpack what we see and hear so that, if we are again faced with the fork in the road, our internal compass will not fail us.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is fitting that this ceremony was held at the newly opened Melbourne Holocaust Museum. Like many, the Melbourne Holocaust Museum relies on the generosity and volunteerism of Holocaust survivors—people like Abram Goldberg, who endured the horrors of the Lodz Ghetto and the Auschwitz concentration camp. His family were murdered. Now, at 98 years old, Abram tells his story to tens of thousands of people, many of them schoolchildren, at the Melbourne Holocaust Museum. It took decades for many Holocaust survivors to talk about the horrors they experienced, but never has it been more important for the lessons of the Holocaust to be heeded. As Abram says, he will continue to share his story until the last time he speaks. </span>

Its dedicated volunteers raise funds to purchase needed items and medical equipment for the Kyogle hospital. It's very active, with 35 members, and it has been operating since 1933. I want to acknowledge the current executive members: Margaret Mitchell, Jan Harlum, Cherie Heath, Elaine Macintosh, Norma Wilson, Joan Low, Carolyn Barnard, Tom and Betty Fitzgerald, and Grace Dwyer. Since 2019, they've donated $85,000 towards developing a residential aged-care activity and lounge room. I was very happy to get a grant to facilitate that. It's a safe area in the hospital which connects residents with loved ones. I thank all of the current members of the hospital auxiliary for what they do for our community. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">McAuley Catholic College competed in the Catholic Schools Debating Association competition held in Sydney last week. They competed in a regional final and then went on to compete in the state final competition. Year 8 students Judy Irwin, Arliah Hartley and Paisley Padayachee received runners-up in the regional competition. And year 7 students Maya Conaghan, Willow Rowney and Amiah Carroll won their regional final, as did year 9 students Aaliyah-Scarlett Roach, Emily Newman and Poppy Ross. They all went on to compete in the state championships, where they debated that religious schools should be banned and that school should not be dealing with contemporary political issues. Both teams finished second in the state. I thank the teachers and coaches Maria Rouse, Linda Gleeson and Leanne Kelly. McAuley Catholic College is a wonderful school in our community, and I congratulate them on their debating success. </span>

Di began in the public works at the Woolgoolga Police Station and then moved on to the Department of Education. She cleaned Mullaway Public School, Woolgoolga High School and then Woolgoolga Public School. She is married to Bob and has two children, Fiona and Todd. In her retirement, Di is looking forward to travelling to New Zealand to spend time with her family. I thank her for all the work she has done in our community. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to thank Izzy Miller for her selfless and quick-thinking act of courage and bravery this week, when she took control of her school bus to avoid a major crash. On 22 November, Casino High School student Izzy was onboard her afternoon school bus when it started rolling away, as the driver was not present in the bus. It was heading towards oncoming traffic, parked cars and the North Casino Mini Mart. Izzy bravely took control of the wheel and steered the bus and all its passengers to a safe stop, which narrowly avoided a potentially major incident. Well done and thank you, Izzy.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fremantle</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:14</span>):  Australia must have a sovereign shipping capacity. It means having the right ships for all our needs. It means ships that are owned and flagged in Australia. It means the ability to build and sustain ships. And it absolutely means a high-quality maritime workforce, from the shipyard and the vessels' crew to the docks. More than 99 per cent of all imports and exports travel by sea. We're an island continent nation in a region of thousands of islands at a time of increasing climate impacts. Without question, our economic, social and environmental wellbeing depend on Australia's sovereign shipping capacity, which needs to be rebuilt after a decade of deterioration. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm incredibly proud to represent a seafaring, shipbuilding and port community. In my community, we're acutely aware that Australian life depends on shipping. Yet, in recent decades, we've seen our sovereign shipping capacity, whether in the form of our Navy or merchant marine, fall away. During the last election, the WA Liberals took out full-page ads in the <span style="font-style:italic;">West Australian</span>, seeking to boost their credentials and saying that WA's role was 'set in stone' and that we'd benefit from 50 per cent of defence shipbuilding. Unfortunately, that wasn't delivered. In fact, the former government presided over a fall in our sovereign shipping capacity. It was driven by their appetite for deregulation and their constitutional aversion to maritime workers and their representatives in the Maritime Union of Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese Labor government won't allow our national interest to be undermined like that. One of the first election commitments Labor made from opposition was that we would establish a strategic shipping task force to look at creating a strategic fleet. Three weeks ago in Fremantle the minister for transport, Catherine King, was on Victoria Quay to announce the government's response to that task force. We've now confirmed our commitment to create a fleet of up to 12 vessels so that Australia is not vulnerable to freight supply disruptions. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week I was with the Minister for Defence Industry to announce a strategic shipbuilding agreement with Austal, which is headquartered in the Australian Marine Complex in Henderson in my electorate. This secures Henderson's future as a vital shipbuilding hub. It provides a shift from a project-to-project acquisition process to a longer-term approach, giving certainty and confidence through a secure pipeline of work. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This will help secure long-term skilled jobs, infrastructure investment and certainty across the extensive supply chain, which is critical for the local and Western Australian economy and my community in Fremantle. These two measures—a strategic merchant fleet and a strategic defence shipbuilding agreement—will be the foundation stones of Australia's future sovereign shipbuilding and ship operational capacity. I'm very proud that Fremantle and Cockburn will be fundamental to that delivery. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Riverina</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:17</span>):  Coolamon, in the Riverina area of south-west New South Wales, is a place of history. Indeed, the town boasts a nationally significant part in First World War folklore, with a famous patriotic quote by the soon to be prime minister being made in the town. It was 5 August 1914 when the soon to be prime minister Andrew Fisher first coined the phrase 'to the last man and the last shilling', showing what we would do, patriotically, to support England in the Great War. He was opposition leader then and soon became Prime Minister. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">'Coolamon' is an Indigenous word meaning 'multipurpose, sustainable tool used for gathering and carrying, or a vessel for food or water'. That's what 'Coolamon' means. It now has a rare opportunity to be a significant place in another dimension—on the moon. Now, space.gov.au is the place where you can vote for 'Coolamon' to be the name used on the next lunar rover. It would be appropriate, given the fact that 'Coolamon' means 'multipurpose, sustainable tool used for gathering'. There are three other names—Kakirra, Mateship and Roo-ver—but don't worry about those. Just go to space.gov.au and vote for 'Coolamon' and put Coolamon on the moon. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that the moon is made of cheese. We do know that. Indeed, Peter English, one of the co-owners of the Coolamon cheese factory, said that he was excited for the moon rover to be bringing back some of the blue cheese from the lunar landscape so that they could serve it to their wonderful customers! The factory is in a former 1920s co-op building, and it's the host for many, many visitors. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Coolamon is a famous town, and it will be only made even more famous if each and every one of us go to space.gov.au. You've got to vote for Coolamon. There are three others, but don't worry about them. It's really important that we do this because the mayor, David McCann—who's not just an OAM but a dual OAM recipient—says so. He says that this will put Coolamon not just on the map in the Riverina or on the map in Australia but on the map on the moon. And what better place to put Coolamon than on the moon? That is what we're trying to achieve. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is going to give this town, which is famous in Great War history and famous because of its 1894 football club—that's when the football and netball club was established. And would you believe the football club is known as the—wait for it—Coolamon Rovers? If the people back in the 1890s had the foresight to name the footy club the Coolamon Rovers, they were obviously thinking ahead to the time when humankind would be on the moon and the lunar rover would be named after their football club and their great town. Go vote for Coolamon.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="HWB" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ZAPPIA</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Makin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:20</span>):  Since April 2019, Julian Assange has been held in the maximum security Belmarsh prison in England as he fights extradition to the USA, where he faces multiple espionage related charges. For the seven years prior, he was confined to the Ecuadorian embassy in London. His alleged wrongdoing was publishing classified US military documents through his WikiLeaks website. Other media outlets that published the same material, including the <span style="font-style:italic;">Guardian</span>, the <span style="font-style:italic;">New York Times</span> and the online US Cryptome blogger, John Young, are not being pursued and never have been by the US government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Julian Assange is an Australian citizen. His health is failing. In September, an Australian cross-party delegation, which consisted of senators David Shoebridge, Peter Whish-Wilson and Alex Antic, as well as the member for New England, Barnaby Joyce; the member for Kooyong, Dr Monique Ryan; and me, travelled to Washington to lobby for the release of Assange. In the two-day privately funded visit, the Australian delegation met with key US government officials and cross-party members of the US Congress. Subsequent to the Australian delegation's visit, 16 cross-party members of the US Congress signed a joint letter to the US President calling for the withdrawal of the Julian Assange extradition request and a halt to the US prosecution. Countless other international human rights advocates, eminent legal persons and world leaders have also called for his release. Three-quarters of a million people have signed a petition in support of Julian Assange.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The widely held view is that Julian Assange is being punished for having embarrassed the US and US individuals. Regardless of whatever view one holds about Julian Assange, including believing he did wrong, almost five years in the high-security Belmarsh prison has been a very heavy penalty, particularly in light of Chelsea Manning, the US intelligence officer who provided the classified material to him, having had her sentence commuted in 2017. It serves no useful purpose to continue the detention and pursuit of Julian Assange. Exposing the truth should not be a crime, and the persecution of Julian Assange contradicts the very principles of freedom of speech and freedom of journalism and wider human rights that the modern world stands for. It diminishes our credibility in speaking up for the human rights of others.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In New York Harbour, since 1886, the Statue of Liberty, with its motto of 'Liberty Enlightening the World', has stood as a beacon of justice, freedom and hope. If the US is to remain true to those values, the case against Julian Assange must be discontinued and he should be set free. As the Prime Minister has said, enough is enough. Can I take just a moment to acknowledge the presence of Gabriel Shipton in the House with us today. He has been a tireless campaigner for the Julian Assange release.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr JOYCE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New England</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:23</span>):  I would like to follow on from the member for Makin and also acknowledge Gabriel Shipton, who's here today. There are very few things that draw together people from both sides of the political fence, whether it's the Greens; Alex Antic; Tony Zappia—we've known each other for a long time and worked together—the Nationals; the Labor Party; the Liberal Party; the Prime Minister, Anthony Albanese; or Peter Dutton, but this issue has done that. It's time that this issue is resolved and brought to a conclusion. I acknowledge that Gabriel Shipton is Julian Assange's brother, but I'm not here to give warrant to Mr Assange did—not for one second. But I am saying that extraterritoriality is an incredibly dangerous precedent. I'll say, for the Australian people, that—and not to go through the details, which the member for Makin has done—Julian Assange was not a US citizen. Julian Assange did not commit a crime in Australia. In fact, he got a Walkley Award for it. Julian Assange was never in the US when any offence that the US has nominated was committed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So we are sending a person to a third country on the behest of a third country because of their domestic laws. Once you start agreeing to do that, it's only a matter of time before the Chinese government says, 'We've got a few people in Australia we want you to send to China.' If someone offends a religion in another part of the world, they'll say, 'You should send those people to us as well.' How are you going to argue against that when you have given credibility to what is happening here? For the US, how are they going to justify their position when they are part and parcel of this? I've said before that Australia has been a good neighbour to the US, and, with Mr Johnny Depp and Amber Heard, who most definitely committed offences in Australia—most definitely—we haven't called for their extradition back to Australia. If we did, they would go to jail for quite a while.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I ask something of those in the United States. I know the Prime Minister of Australia has now been to the US. I'm not going to delve into what discussions the Prime Minister may or may not have had, but I want to reinforce to the people of the United States and the government of the United States our great respect for their nation but our displeasure that this issue continues on. It needs to be resolved. This carbuncle in the relationship needs to be removed. We have bigger fish to fry. There are bigger issues out there for us to deal with. This issue needs to be put aside.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to also acknowledge the great work done by the delegation with Tony Zappia, Alex Antic, Peter Whish-Wilson, Monique Ryan and David Shoebridge—I'm forgetting some more. I thank them for their work. The support will continue on.</span>

                  <a href="13050" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr ALY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cowan</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Early Childhood Education and Minister for Youth</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:26</span>):  I rise to read a speech from Abi Julien, a young person who lives in Noranda, in my electorate of Cowan. Abi wrote this speech for the Raise Our Voice program this year, where members raise the voices of young people in parliament. Abi's response is to this year's question, which was: what change would make Australia a better place for future generations? Her speech reads:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Today, I address a very important matter that impacts the very core of our society—the mental health crisis that young Australians are facing. The future of our country is significantly dependent on the well-being of our youth, making it more than just a matter of the present, but one if not acted upon, could span generations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">In Australia, the situation of youth mental health is quite concerning. The data presents a bleak image: 1 in 4 young Australians suffer from mental health problems, and the percentage is rising. If these issues are not resolved, they may cause a lifetime of difficulties, such as strained relationships and interrupted prospects for work and education and possibly end in suicide.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Every year, more than 350 young people between the ages of 18 and 24 commit suicide. It's our friends, our classmates, our family. It's not just numbers on a chart. We need a country where it's okay to say, "I'm not okay, and I need help." A society where it is not seen as a weakness but a strength, because we are not just the future- we are the here and now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">As we navigate the complex ground of youth mental health, it becomes critical to acknowledge the various difficulties associated with the Internet. The influence of social media on young people's mental health in an age of technological connectivity cannot be overstated.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The Internet, while a powerful tool for information and communication, can also be a breeding ground for the detrimental forces affecting the mental health of adolescents. Social media platforms amplify the struggles of young individuals in unique ways. The unrealistic body standards on display can give rise to a variety of issues, including self-esteem problems, body dysmorphia and anxiety, pushing young people further into isolation and depression.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">In conclusion, the mental health of adolescents is critical to the future of our country and should not be disregarded. By working together, we can create a country that prioritises the health and happiness of its youth, ensuring a more optimistic and promising future for Australia.</span>
              </p>

Later, in 1993, the book was made into an Academy Award winning film, <span style="font-style:italic;">Schindler's </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Li</span><span style="font-style:italic;">st</span>, directed by Steven Spielberg. No one could come away from that film unmoved. The imagery of the little girl in a red dress is one that I will never forget. Movies such as <span style="font-style:italic;">Schindler's </span><span style="font-style:italic;">L</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ist</span> remind us of events in living history. It was not that long ago, and there are still survivors today who bear the marks of their experiences on their arms. Indeed, it was only October 2021 when Eddie Jaku, the author of another moving story <span style="font-style:italic;">T</span><span style="font-style:italic;">he </span><span style="font-style:italic;">H</span><span style="font-style:italic;">appiest </span><span style="font-style:italic;">M</span><span style="font-style:italic;">an on </span><span style="font-style:italic;">E</span><span style="font-style:italic;">arth</span>, passed away. Eddie's story of survival against all odds and against the most evil of regimes was remarkable, to say the least, and Eddie's book should be compulsory reading.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That said, those who cannot remember the past are condemned to repeat it. We in this House must never forget the atrocities committed by fascism. We must never allow another regime as described by the likes of Keneally and Jaku to exist again. Some symbols unite us, such as our coat of arms, representing a united Australia held up by two of our most iconic native animals and featuring the seven-point Commonwealth Star. Similarly, the Olympic flag represents much that is good: faster, higher, stronger, together. Unfortunately, not all symbols are in this category. Symbols such as those that this bill proposes to ban only exist to promote hate, cause division and allow evil to flourish—symbols that fascist movements, from the Nazis on, have used to rally people to the cause of hate. So it is appropriate that we, together, prohibit the exhibition of these symbols of hate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill has a number of different provisions. Schedule 1 of this bill will criminalise the public display and trading in of three particular items. These are the Nazi Hakenkreuz, the Nazi SS Bolts and those associated with terrorist organisations. The symbols will be prohibited in a broad range of settings, including online. There will, however, be specific exemptions for religious, academic, educational, artistic, literary, journalistic or scientific purposes where that display is not contrary to the public interest. Importantly, it needs to be pointed out that the sacred swastika in connection with Buddhist, Hindu or Jain religious observances will not be captured by these provisions. The government acknowledges the importance of this ancient symbol and its significance to these faith communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's amendments will criminalise performing the Nazi salute in public, to address the significant harm that this behaviour causes to Australian communities. The ideas represented by this are fundamentally incompatible with Australia's multicultural, democratic and inclusive society. Finally, the trading offence in schedule 1 will target commercial profiting, including selling, renting or leasing paraphernalia containing prohibited Nazi symbols or symbols associated with terrorist organisations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 2 of the bill will criminalise using a carriage service for violent extremist material and possessing or controlling violent extremist material obtained or accessed using a carriage service. A carriage service will include a range of platforms, including webpages, social media platforms, email, chat forums, text messages or the download of violent extremist material from the internet onto a digital storage device.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Violent, extremist material, which is used to radicalise people and instil fear in our community, has no place in Australia. Criminalising the use of a carriage service for violent, extremist material would allow law enforcement to take actions against persons who are exploiting the internet to recruit, spread propaganda and incite violence, particularly those targeting young people. Offences under schedule 2 will be punishable by up to seven years imprisonment, and allow law enforcement intervention at an earlier stage in individual's progress towards that radicalisation. In turn, it will provide greater opportunity for rehabilitation and disruption of violent, extremist networks.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 3 of the bill will expand the 'advocating terrorism' offence in section 80.2C of the Criminal Code to include providing instruction on the doing of a terrorist act or praising such an act where there is substantial risk that praise will lead to another person engaging in a terrorist act. This will address increasing concerns about the promotion and idealisation of extremist views as a form of radicalisation, particularly with respect to young people becoming radicalised online. Recognising that advocating terrorism is a serious and intentional act which can incite violence against innocent Australians, schedule 3 of the bill will increase the maximum penalty for this offence from five to seven years imprisonment. This will ensure that the penalty more appropriately accounts for the potential severity of the offending and better aligns with penalties for similar offences in the Criminal Code.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 4 of the bill will remove the sunsetting requirements from regulations listing organisations as terrorist organisations under division 102 of the Criminal Code. At present, listings cease to have effect after a period of three years and must be remade for an organisation to remain proscribed. The removal of the sunsetting requirements from terrorist listing regulations will help align the framework within the enduring nature of a terrorist organisation and its operations. Of the 29 organisations currently listed, the majority have been relisted multiple times, some as many as eight times. While there are existing strong safeguards to ensure that any listing of an organisation is appropriate and ceases should the organisation no longer meet the threshold, the bill will enhance these safeguards.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I understand that the provisions of this bill have the support of key community organisations, including the Executive Council of Australian Jewry, the Australian Muslim Advocacy Network, the Australian Catholic Bishops Conference, the Hindu Council of Australia and representatives of the Australian Buddhist community. The bill deserves the same unanimous support in the House. We obviously have our differences on many issues. Healthy debate in this chamber is essential for democracy, and it is that that these terrorist organisations seek to undermine.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have enough examples on the historical record to prove that radicalisation, and the glorification of these symbols, is not going away. Good thoughts and wishes are not going to deal with the problems this bill addresses. Like other members in the House, my electorate is home to those who have fled their former homes and have been victims of persecution, so in a very real sense this bill has personal resonance for me. We need to send a clear message to those who might be attracted to the organisations these symbols represent. We need action, and this is what the bill delivers, and it does so in the clearest of ways. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Sturt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:38</span>):  Last week, I was doing my regular phone canvassing program and I spoke to a lady who's now retired but spent her life as a nurse in Australia, having grown up in the United Kingdom. She also happens to be Jewish. As many members of parliament do, I was speaking to local residents to see if they have any issues or concerns they want to raise with their local federal member of parliament, and she said to me, 'I'm shocked to say that the thing I want to raise with you is that I'm Jewish and, for the first time in my life, I genuinely feel uncomfortable living here locally in the eastern suburbs of Adelaide.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Watching the news, following some of the protest movements and invocations at these atrocious events that are occurring in our country right now, is making some Jewish Australians, for the first time ever, feel something in our community that they thought was to be left in history and another part of the world. It's quite heartbreaking that Jewish Australians, like the lady I spoke to last week, are feeling that way. I have a fantastic community servant in my electorate, Andrew Steiner, who is a Holocaust survivor and established the Adelaide Holocaust Museum. He was a young boy in Budapest and lost many members of his family to the Holocaust. As a young man he made it out, probably escaping a fate of death at the hands of the Schutzstaffel in Eastern Europe. Now, in his early 90s, he's seeing things that remind him of the childhood that he remembers with great horror and the terror that he fled.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have an opportunity here, as a parliament, to send a message which we hoped we'd never have to send. We're banning the swastika, when we never thought any human being that knew anything about what that symbol means in a certain context would want to invoke it. Unfortunately, as a parliament, we have to take action because, in the year 2023, there are people that want to glorify and relive the most horrific elements of what the Nazi regime, which is represented by that symbol, did. They attempted to wipe out an entire race of people—genocide—and they had a good go of it, with six million dead. Unfortunately, in the modern era, there are people that want to promote that, celebrate it and, one fears, perhaps even call for its occurrence again. We've seen it in our own country at some of these events—people uttering slogans and statements that are very much calling for or seeking a second form of holocaust. I made comments about that in another debate, and I won't relive the horror and horrendousness of some of the things that have happened, but I also fear what may be yet to come. The current situation in the Middle East is far from over, and there are people, right here in our own country, who are elevating and extending some of the vile and disgusting things that they're saying and the behaviour that they're displaying.</span>

One way we can do that is to unanimously support this important measure through the parliament. I hoped that we could've done it a bit sooner than this, and we did attempt to—</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr STEVENS:</span>
                    </a>  As I was saying, it is in some ways regrettable that we need to pass this legislation. It seems unfathomable that in 2023, nearly 70 years after the awful horrors of the Nazi regime in Europe during the Second World War, there would be anyone living in our community who would want to invoke and celebrate Nazism and display representations of the horrors of the Nazi regime. But regrettably we've seen, particularly in the last six weeks or so, that that is indeed the case. There are some awful invocations of that era that I thought was left well and truly in history and in another part of the world. There are Jewish Australians in particular who are for the first time feeling so uncomfortable living somewhere where they should never expect to have visited upon them the sort of treatment that was visited upon Jewish people through the 1930s in Germany and, as the Third Reich expanded, more broadly in Europe. We know that the persecution of Jewish people had endured through history well before Adolf Hitler and the Nazi regime, but the most vile manifestation of antisemitism was beyond question the Holocaust.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I reflected on the principles of free speech when this legislation was first mooted. I thought about whether or not people have the right to hold opinions, despite how appalling and outrageous they might be, and say what they want and what they think in a free society. People have that right. But this is beyond the principle of free speech because, by using these hate symbols, this is the glorification of criminal activity, of genocide and of vile, disgusting behaviour and seeking to inspire it in other people. That is beyond the principles of free speech. That is seeking to relive and celebrate previous crimes and to inspire new crimes into the future, and we absolutely should have no ambiguity about standing up against that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Regrettably, we do need this legislation. I appreciate the hard work of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security and I know that they made sure they looked at a whole range of things that are important to look at. Firstly, we obviously respect the use and display of these symbols that we are seeking to ban in one particular category. In certain religions, the swastika is an enduring, important symbol for that religion and that culture, and it's not the fault of those people that it was adopted by the Nazi regime. We certainly are making sure that, on religious grounds, that is not captured. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is also important that the stories of the horrors of the Holocaust are told—it's more important now, unfortunately, than ever. So, again, we do not want restrictions in the teaching of history or in the depiction of the Nazi regime in culture, film and on the stage et cetera. We don't want these laws to cover what is an important part of keeping the memory of one of the most appalling, awful chapters in the history of humankind alive so it is a lesson for people today. We are, indeed, in debating this legislation, remembering that lesson. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've been to Yad Vashem in Jerusalem and I've been to the Dachau concentration camp. I was very proud to work with former Treasurer Frydenberg in securing a significant investment in the Adelaide Holocaust Museum and, in particular, giving students access to visit that very confronting display of that horrible period of human history, because we know how important it is that our next generation understand what the atrocities of the past were, so that we never see them repeated again.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact that, in the last few weeks, we have heard things said and seen placards, depictions and slogans at rallies and events—things that I am still in a degree of shock about and that I never thought I'd see in my own country—goes to show, regrettably, that Holocaust education, as well as Holocaust commemoration, is as important now as it has ever been. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is regrettable that we need this legislation, but it is important that we pass it. I think the parliament coming together—I hope, unanimously—to legislate the banning of these vile, hateful symbols will send a very powerful message to anyone that is partial towards them or the disgusting, appalling ideology that underpins them: that the Australian parliament is absolutely united against anyone that has any sympathy for the Nazi regime or the crimes that they committed and that we stand in great solidarity, particularly with Jewish Australians, who right now in particular are feeling very uncomfortable, even in their own country. This sign from the leadership of our nation, the parliament of our nation, is a great opportunity for them, hopefully, to have an experience of hope in what's been a very difficult few weeks for them. I commend the bill to the House. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Blair</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:08</span>):  There are two experiences that I recall, as a politician in this place on overseas trips, that really struck me and really affected me. The first one was visiting Yad Vashem, which is of course Israel's national Holocaust museum, a place dedicated to the memory of the victims of the Holocaust—to preserve the memory of those Jewish people who were murdered by the Nazi regime in Germany and their allies—and also those non-Jewish people who selflessly assisted the Jewish people to escape and aided them in their efforts to flee the Nazi regime.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I recall that occasion, walking around—by myself—and being there with a bunch of young men and women, who were conscripts in the Israeli military, who were being taken through Yad Vashem and being reminded of what happened. It was very profound, as a person with my surname, a Germanic surname, whose ancestors, on my dad's side, had come to Australia in the 1880s, fleeing religious persecution themselves. I felt very moved on that occasion.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second occasion was when I was visiting the German parliament. In the German parliament you can see the bullet holes in the wall, and there is a little stand there with a book that looks like the Torah or the Talmud or the Bible or the Koran. But, when you open the pages, on each page there is a biography of those members of the German parliament who were slaughtered by the Nazis when Hitler came to power and in the years after that. This could have been many people in our country: Social Democrats, Labor MPs, Christian Democrats, conservative Liberal and National Party MPs. There was no discrimination. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Nazi regime burned down their parliament and blamed the communists and then proceeded to persecute Jews, Catholics, trade unions, and any civil organisation and politicians who opposed the regime. The ferocity of the denunciation by Dietrich Bonhoeffer, the great Lutheran pastor, on national radio—almost on the night that Hitler came to power—was a great demonstration of standing up for freedom and liberty by a person who followed their moral core and compass and who, by ethical and strong convictions, from a religious point of view, opposed the Nazis. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will never forget those two occasions in my life. So I rise to speak on this particular legislation that deals with Nazi symbols. I agree with the member for Sturt that it is a shame that we have to do this in a liberal democracy. But we need to do it, because there are people out there on the extremes of our society who do the wrong things, who venerate and idolise and admire the Nazi regime, Nazism, fascism and militarism. It is just abhorrent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Many people gave their lives. Six million Jews and many others, including gypsies, homosexuals, Jehovah's Witnesses and people who opposed the Nazi regime, were slaughtered. This legislation that is before the chamber shows that there is no place for this, and I hope this parliament decides to support it unanimously. There is no place for violence and hatred and antisemitism—and there is absolutely no place for symbols that glorify the Holocaust or human rights atrocities. We can never allow people to profit from the display and the sale of items that celebrate Nazism and its evil ideology. To that end, in June, this government, the Albanese Labor government, introduced a comprehensive package of reforms to protect the community from those who want to spread hate and radicalise others to commit acts of terror.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill before the chamber, the Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment (Prohibited Hate Symbols and Other Measures) Bill 2023, makes it clear that there is no place for those who seek to profit from these symbols. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill makes it a criminal offence to publicly display Nazi and Islamic State symbols or trade in items bearing these symbols. The bill criminalises public displays of the Nazi hakenkreuz, the hooked cross; the Nazi Schutzstaffel; the double sig rune, the SS bolts; and the Islamic State flag, hate symbols, as well as banning the trade of these items. The bill will exclude public displays of these symbols for religious, academic, educational, artistic, literary, journalistic or scientific purposes. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These symbols are widely recognised as symbols of hatred, violence and racism. The ban includes but is not limited to the trade and public display of flags, armbands, t-shirts, insignia and the publication of symbols online promoting Nazi ideology. The ban will not in any way apply to the display and use of the swastika, which is of spiritual significance to religions such as Hinduism, Jainism and Buddhism. We consulted with these communities to ensure nothing in the bill would impinge on the use and display of these symbols in association with legitimate religious expression and worship.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also creates offences for accessing and sharing violent extremist material online. These new offences will allow law enforcement to intervene earlier and disrupt violent extremists before their actions place the community in danger and inspire others to follow these dangerous paths of radicalisation. The bill also amends the terrorist organisation listing framework. It provides that the listing of a terrorist organisation will apply indefinitely unless revoked. This is because the current sunsetting date of three years is unnecessarily short and does not reflect the longevity of terrorist organisations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll just outline some of the key provisions. The bill amends the Criminal Code—that's the Commonwealth Criminal Code—in light of the evolving threat environment, particularly the threat of ideologically motivated violent extremism. Firstly, it criminalises the display, as I stated, of prohibited hate symbols. These symbols are associated with recruitment activities of violent extremist groups and have the effect of harassing or vilifying targeted groups. The offence will apply to a broad range of settings, including online. There will be specific exemptions, as I said. The bill does not prevent the private ownership of such material. However, anyone seeking to pass on such items will not be able to seek payment unless an exemption is applied for, because no-one should be able to profit in this way. The Federal Police and the state and territory police enforcing Commonwealth offences will be provided with a new power to issue a direction that materials containing a prohibited symbol be removed from public display.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, it would criminalise the use of a carriage service to deal with violent extremist material, including instructional terrorist material. This would facilitate law enforcement intervention at an earlier stage in an individual's progress to violent radicalisation and provide greater opportunity for disruption of such networks. A carriage service would include a range of platforms such as webpages, social media applications, email, chat forums, text messages and the like. We're introducing these provisions because this type of violent extremist material is used to radicalise people and has no place in our society. There'll be punishments of up to five years imprisonment, and this will facilitate law enforcement intervention at an earlier stage. It complements existing frameworks for regulating online service providers, including offences for hosting abhorrent violent material, and the eSafety Commissioner's powers to require providers to remove or cease to host certain content.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Thirdly, the bill will align different 'advocating terrorism' definitions in the Criminal Code and expand the advocating terrorism offence in section 80.2 to include providing instruction of the doing of a terrorist act and praising the doing of a terrorist act where there is substantial risk that the praise will lead to another person engaging in a terrorist act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Fourthly, the bill will increase the maximum penalty for the offence of advocating terrorism from five to seven years, which recognises that advocating terrorism is a serious, intentional act that can incite violence against innocent Australians. This is more appropriate in my view. This is because the promotion and idealisation of extremist views are of increasing concern, and it's not just here in Australia. A few short weeks ago I was in Trafalgar Square and saw legitimate people protesting in relation to Palestinian issues. But there were—I saw them clearly—symbols of Nazi glorification that clearly identified with antisemitic views. It was quite confronting to see that in a place that is so beloved by Londoners and by the world generally—a place that celebrates that great cosmopolitan city. It is absolutely legitimate to protest and to express your views in a liberal democracy, but antisemitism and the glorification of Nazism are not. They simply are not.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At present, can I just say that in this country we have real problems. It's not just overseas; you can see it by watching any news—Al Jazeera, BBC, France 24. On any form of news network, you can see it. We have major problems that we have to work with, and we've got to work with state and territory colleagues and law enforcement agencies to keep our communities safe and to make sure that we stamp out hatred in all its expressions. We're sending a clear message through this legislation to those who seek to spread hatred, violence and antisemitism: we find it repugnant, and it will not be tolerated.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill was referred to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security for an inquiry, and the Attorney-General requested the committee consider the bill promptly. The committee has reported back, and I understand that tomorrow the Attorney-General will introduce amendments in the House, based on these recommendations, to strengthen our legislation by making the Nazi salute a criminal offence under Commonwealth law. It's important that the Commonwealth provide leadership in this space; under the amendments, the Albanese government will ban the public display of the Nazi salute, making clear there's no place for that expression in our polity. The Attorney-General, I'm sure, will have more to say about that tomorrow.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We can't ignore the bigger context in which this is happening. It is worth noting, since the atrocities of 7 October in Israel and Israel's incursions into Gaza, regrettably, there's been an alarming uptick of antisemitism in this country. Many Jewish Australians are feeling fearful and anxious, and this has stirred up long and painful memories of the Holocaust. That should not be happening in a land that offered them refuge then and embraces them now. The Chifley government brought in 35,000 Jewish people fleeing the horrors of Nazism after World War II. I want to thank Jason Steinberg, the president of the Queensland Jewish Board of Deputies and Board Chairman of the Queensland Holocaust Museum and Education Centre, for the work that he does and many others do with the Jewish community in my home state of Queensland.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As this conflict continues, it appears antisemitism is on the rise and we are determined not to let it get a foothold in this country. We should always denounce it and reject it utterly, as we do with all forms of racism and prejudice. With this legislation, the government is taking a strong stand. There is no place in Australia for symbols that glorify the horrors of the Holocaust and there is no place for those who seek to profit from the trade of these evil symbols or to use them to promote their hatred. We owe it to our multicultural society and to our Jewish community and their survivors. In the words of a Holocaust survivor Peter Gaspar, who lost 40 members of his extended family:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Holocaust didn't start with gas chambers and murders and executions. It started with stereotyping, prejudice, discrimination, hate speech …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are words we need to heed even today and every day. We need to remember Australians are stronger when we work together.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly, right now, events in our world seem to be tearing us apart. Now more than ever, we must remind ourselves of Australia's fundamental strength. The cohesion of our multicultural society is one of our greatest national assets. This asset is something we should all contribute to every day. Generations of Australian migrants, from all over the world, have given us this very precious gift, and today we are the most successful multicultural nation on earth. These trailblazers worked across languages, cultures and faiths to build a country that we love, and everyone from politicians to people attending protests need to play their part in protecting it. Legitimate protest is fine; displaying Nazi symbols is not. That means being considerate in what we say to our friends and our colleagues and in those things we choose to post and share online. It means: pause and consider your fellow citizens during this time. In doing so, we are supporting a safer community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our intelligence agencies have made it very clear they see a direct relationship between language and violence. We see it in domestic situations, and we see it in our polity. In this febrile environment, it behoves us in this place to choose our actions and our words very carefully. Everyone is in a leadership position in this parliament, all 151 of us. We have a special responsibility to build national unity, not to amplify or create division, and safeguard our social cohesion. We should stand with people, not against them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's be clear: we stand with both the Jewish community and our Muslim community. No Australian should experience terror or horror as a price of their faith. The government continues to monitor the domestic security situation closely. We should always do everything we can to not only oppose Islamic extremism but also protect legitimate expression for Islamic people as well. We should be protecting both our Jewish community and our Islamic community locally. They contribute to our society, our economy and our polity. We should be a beacon of light and faith and hope and love.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Goldstein</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:24</span>):  As we awoke this morning, the newspapers were carrying a two-page advertisement from more than 600 prominent Australians—business, community and sporting leaders—decrying the increase in antisemitism in the seven weeks since the appalling Hamas terrorist attacks on Israeli communities. According to the organisers of the advertisement, there has been an increase of 482 per cent in antisemitic incidents in Australia in those seven weeks. As the signatories say:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We are unequivocal in our resolve that racism in all its forms is deplorable and abhorrent. Whether directed towards Jewish Australians, Muslim Australians, Asian Australians, Indigenous Australians or any other minority, we will not tolerate such conduct in our workplaces and firmly reject it in our communities. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">To our Jewish employees, business partners, customers and all who are affected, we acknowledge the heightened feelings of threat being felt by your community right now and affirm your right to physical and psychological safety.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is in line with what I've been saying publicly, including in parliament, for weeks now.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Two Fridays ago, at Princes Park in Caulfield South in my electorate of Goldstein, my fears were realised. As I said in the matter of public importance when the House last sat:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The unfolding conflict in Israel and Gaza had reached the streets of Melbourne in a frightening way, on a Friday, Shabbat, when members of our Jewish community were at worship in a synagogue nearby. A fire in a nearby Palestinian-owned store drew protesters into a heavily Jewish neighbourhood, at a time when residents were walking the streets to and from shule with their families. … No-one was seriously hurt, thankfully, but the anxiety among the Jewish community after the terror attacks of 7 October in Israel affecting, in many cases, people who they know, has been magnified. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the signatories to today's advertisement affirm, antisemitism is on the rise. We've seen antisemitic stickers plastered over a Starbucks outlet in central Melbourne, businesses with Jewish employees targeted by protesters with intimidating anti-Israeli signs and, recently, a Nazi sympathiser giving the Nazi salute as he left court and Neo-Nazis doing the same on the steps of the Victorian parliament. This is what this legislation is designed to help address. The question is whether it goes far enough, and I'll come to that shortly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the days since 7 October, many Jewish people have become fearful and anxious when outside their homes—and with justification. Some students from Jewish schools are avoiding wearing uniforms, and Jewish businesses are facing protests and boycotts. At the same time, Palestinian Australians and others are traumatised by events in Gaza. I am too. I'm desperately concerned about those in the Jewish community in Goldstein and the deaths of thousands of civilians in Gaza, especially children. As I've previously said in this place, the two feelings can coexist—indeed, they must.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some weeks ago, the director-general of ASIO warned: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… words matter. ASIO has seen direct connections between inflamed language and inflamed community tensions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not just words but also symbols that matter. That's what this legislation is about: symbols of hate designed to inflame and arouse fear, and to promote collectives of people to do both those things. The legislation would criminalise the public display and trading of two Nazi symbols representing, as the Attorney-General has said, the vile ideology of the Third Reich and conjuring fear in many sectors of the Australian community whose families suffered the horrors of the Holocaust. However, the question is: what about other Nazi symbols? Jewish community leaders I've consulted are deeply worried, especially the Executive Council of Australian Jewry. As Peter Wertheim said in an email to me, Nazi groups will easily circumvent this by using other well-recognised Nazi symbols. In my view, the prohibition should be more general so that it can't be circumvented. I've discussed this with the Attorney-General, and he's undertaken that a close eye will be paid to this potential loophole for alternative hate symbols to be used.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">ECAJ has also noted the need to prohibit Nazi salutes, and I'm pleased that the government has come around to including this in this legislation, despite initial hesitancy around jurisdiction. I agree with the executive council that there should be a federal law against Nazi gestures being performed in public so that there is a consistent legal regime across the country. So I welcome this measure. I'm also pleased that the legislation will ban trade in the outlawed Nazi symbols immediately, rather than being delayed by six to 12 months to give collectors a chance to dispose of those items. Those in possession of those items should have seen this coming, and I see no reason for a substantive delay.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia has limited ability to influence the course of events in Israel and Gaza. What we can do and have a responsibility to do is to articulate multipartisan calm, to encourage empathy and, at all costs, to take the politics away as well as to pull the legislative and policy levers that are available to us. From that perspective, this legislation is urgent. We must do everything that we can to maintain and promote social cohesion. I'm sure that most of my colleagues in this place will have been alarmed at the tone of communications from constituents to their offices in recent weeks—threats, anger and hatred from all sides.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Personally, on that level, having seen the aftermath of conflict around the world and, as a reporter, having been amid deadly civil unrest myself, I remain extremely concerned about what happens next, and that goes to triggers for hate in our communities here. Some years ago, I was amid the Red Shirts unrest in Bangkok, where pro-democracy protesters shutdown the city for several months until the military cleared them out, on a deadly day for both reporters and civilians, in 2010. In that case, a red shirt was the symbol, and wearing one could get you shot. I will never forget hiding under a Skytrain bridge that afternoon with a camera operator and producer as bullets pinged off the buildings around us—nor witnessing the bodies on the ground after. Anger and political tension—I learnt, through lived experience—can degenerate very quickly, and that's without the deep and scarring memories of the Holocaust, which are underpinning the very real and justified fear among Australia's Jewish community right now. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently, I was informed of the circulation in Goldstein and Kooyong of a Neo-Nazi flyer laden with antisemitism that vilified current and former MPs with language redolent of the catchphrases of the Nazism of Germany in the 1930s and 1940s. The horrors that led to the Holocaust were enabled, in part, by the Nazi regime's sophisticated harnessing of the popular media of the time: radio, film and print. The digital landscape of the 21st century is far more complex, enabling evil actors not just to spout their extremist invocations but to interact with each other and to seduce those vulnerable to their conspiracist siren songs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I've said before, and will now say again, free speech is not hate speech, and hate speech should not be defended as such. The two things are vastly different and should be called out as such, as should right-wing extremism and those who fan it for their own ends. As Lydia Khalil, the Lowy Institute's project director of digital threats to democracy, put it in her submission to the inquiry into extremist movements and radicalism in Australia that was conducted in the last parliament by the Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Conspiracy theories and conspiratorial mindsets are not new and have been identified as a factor in radicalising extremist movements. However, conspiratorial movements or individuals who believe in a conspiracy and are connected online, are now emerging as a standalone domestic extremist threat. </span>

That said, I support this legislation wholeheartedly—not a moment too soon.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Chisholm</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:33</span>):  The Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment (Prohibited Hate Symbols and Other Measures) Bill 2023 is a crucial piece of legislation aimed at bolstering Australia's national security framework and protecting our communities. In an era characterised by evolving threats posed by violent extremism and terrorism, the need for proactive and adaptable legislative responses cannot be overstated. Today I'd like to highlight some of the key provisions of the bill in addressing these contemporary challenges, and, of course, these contemporary challenges remind us of a very dark period in our world's history.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's essential to understand the broader context of the evolving threat landscape that we currently find ourselves in. Terrorism, particularly that driven by extremist ideologies, remains a persistent global concern. Like every other nation, Australia has not been immune to these threats. The nature of terrorism has undergone significant transformation in recent years, with extremist groups exploiting the internet and social media to radicalise and recruit individuals. We know extremists utilise symbols, propaganda and instructional material to further their ideologies and incite violence. The bill recognises this evolving threat and seeks to address it comprehensively.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the fundamental components of this bill is the criminalisation of the public display of prohibited hate symbols. Specifically, the bill targets symbols associated with Nazi ideologies—such as the hakenkreuz, or swastika, and the double sig rune—and those associated with terrorist organisations that are widely recognised as representing hatred, violence and racism and are incompatible with Australian values. As such, the use of these symbols poses a severe threat to Australia's multicultural and democratic society, something we simply cannot accept. The bill's provisions are essential for several reasons, including prohibiting the public display of these symbols, which prevents their use as tools to incite hatred, fear and violence in our community. Of course, symbols like the swastika, or hakenkreuz, have a dark history of association with atrocities, and their public display can have a profound psychological impact.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Something I don't often talk about is the fact that my great-grandfather was murdered by Nazis in a concentration camp. My grandparents lived through the horrors of Nazi occupation, and my grandmother, as a child, remembers Nazis coming to her family's door to take her father away. She still carries this trauma. Many people still carry the trauma of World War II, and I do not want that trauma to be experienced in multicultural Australia through the display of these hateful symbols. It's important that we help people to heal from these traumas. I know many Holocaust survivors and their families and others for whom these symbols are a painful and traumatic reminder of evil. If this bill helps with the healing, through not exposing people to such disgusting, evil symbols that remind them of a time where they were attacked, persecuted and murdered, then that is a very good thing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Extremists use these symbols as a means to recruit and radicalise individuals. When we criminalise their public display, we're able to disrupt their extremist narrative and therefore make it more challenging for people who want to exploit these symbols to attract vulnerable Australians to violence. Hate symbols disproportionately affect certain communities, causing harm and distress. This bill aims to protect those communities from the psychological and emotional impact of such symbols, and I've described some of my own experiences of that previously here. This legislation aligns with Australia's international human rights obligations, particularly those aimed at eradicating incitement to racial discrimination and prohibiting discrimination.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to criminalising the public display of prohibited symbols, this legislation takes a comprehensive approach by also addressing the trading in goods that bear these symbols. This is significant for several reasons. Firstly, extremist groups often use the sale of merchandise bearing hate symbols to fund their horrible activities. By criminalising this trade, the bill strikes a blow against their financial resources, thereby undermining their operational capabilities. Secondly, the sale of goods with prohibited symbols extends their reach and influence. By curtailing this trade, the bill prevents the spread of extremist ideologies and their associated symbols. Thirdly, holding individuals accountable for trading in such goods sends a clear message that there is absolutely no tolerance for extremist ideologies. This not only deters potential offenders but also supports law enforcement efforts to address radicalisation. Finally, the bill's provisions—</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Dr GARLAND:</span>
                    </a>  To return to what I was saying earlier, the bill's provisions align with international standards and obligations, particularly those aimed at eradicating racial discrimination and hate speech.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another critical aspect of this bill is the introduction of new offences related to the use of carriage services for violent extremist material. In an age where the internet plays a pivotal role in radicalisation, these provisions are timely and necessary. Extremists exploit the internet to spread propaganda and recruit individuals. These offences target the use of carriage services for disseminating extremist material, effectively curtailing their online reach. By introducing these offences, the bill enables law enforcement to intervene at an earlier stage in individuals' progression towards violent radicalisation. This not only prevents potential acts of terrorism but also provides critical opportunities for rehabilitation and disrupting extremist networks. These offences complement existing regulations governing online service providers and the eSafety Commissioner's powers to remove harmful content. Together, they create a robust framework for regulating online extremist content.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The counter-terrorism legislation amendment bill also expands the offence of advocating terrorism. This expansion includes instructing on the commission of a terrorist act and praising the commission of a terrorist act in specified circumstances. The significance of this expansion will be evident in several ways: the expanded offence targets individuals who provide instructions or praise acts of terrorism, thereby preventing the incitement to violence against innocent Australians; and it acts as a deterrent against those seeking to radicalise and promote extremist ideologies. Increasing the maximum penalty for advocating terrorism from five to seven years imprisonment underscores the gravity of the offence. It ensures that individuals who engage in such conduct face appropriate consequences for their actions. The expansion of this offence also aligns with Australia's international human rights obligations, particularly those related to incitement to violence and discrimination.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill also addresses a critical aspect of national security by removing the sunsetting requirements for regulations that prescribe terrorist organisations. As we know, terrorist organisations pose ongoing threats to national security. Removing the sunsetting requirements ensures that these organisations remain listed until they are actively delisted by the minister, aligning with the seriousness of their offences. Listing terrorist organisations facilitates the prosecution of individuals associated with these groups, deterring support for terrorism and importantly safeguarding the Australian community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill also introduces safeguards to ensure that organisations are appropriately listed and that delisting declarations specify the date on which conditions justifying proscription no longer exist. This protects individuals from unjust convictions related to their association with listed organisations. It's really important that this bill balances rights such as freedom of expression and privacy with our international human rights obligations and for people to be free from being persecuted or discriminated against while balancing the curtailment of freedom of expression and privacy in instances where national security is our primary focus.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill criminalises the praising of terrorist acts only when there is a substantial risk of incitement. This ensures that that limitation on freedom of expression is proportional to the objective of preventing terrorism. The limitations on privacy introduced by the bill are lawful, not arbitrary, and necessary to protect national security, public order and the rights and freedoms of others. This bill includes provisions to exempt legitimate religious uses of otherwise prohibited symbols, such as the sacred swastika, ensuring religious freedoms are respected and protected.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This important piece of legislation represents a critical step towards safeguarding Australia's national security in the face of evolving threats from violent extremism and terrorism that unfortunately we are seeing in our communities. Its provisions, including the criminalisation of prohibited hate symbols, addressing online radicalisation, expanding the offence of advocating terrorism and removing sunsetting requirements for terrorist organisations are necessary, proportionate and aligned with international human rights obligations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In an era when the Internet has become a powerful tool for extremists, when symbols of hate continue to incite violence and when terrorist organisations pose ongoing threats, this bill stands as a robust legislative response. We know thousands of Australians fought and died to defeat the evil that some within our community now seek to promote with these symbols. We know too, as a multicultural nation, that people from all over the world escape violence and persecution to create a safe home for themselves and their families in Australia. Prohibiting these hate symbols is part of making sure people feel safe and included in their communities. I've already described my own family's experience and the need to make sure that we look after people who are going to be traumatised when they see these symbols, as it reminds them of a period of unbelievable evil in the world.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're taking action in this legislation to ensure that people in our communities can live their lives safe and free and without fear. By addressing the contemporary challenges we're presented with, we protect the safety and security of our Australian community and we also uphold the values of democracy, multiculturalism and human rights that are at the absolute core of Australian society.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bass</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:03</span>):  Even prior to the current conflict in the Middle East, far-right extremism and the use of Nazi symbols to promote hate and violence were on the rise in Australia and across the world. Earlier this year, we watched footage of Neo-Nazis in a monstrous display of intimidation outside the Victorian parliament. Alarmingly, in Northern Tasmania, in the small town of Longford just outside my electorate, a local park has been vandalised with Nazi symbols and messages of white supremacy and antisemitism. In my own electorate of Bass, there have been similar incidents, which the local Jewish community have quietly gone about cleaning up themselves or with the local council's support to avoid inspiring copycats.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The ASIO chief told the Senate estimates earlier this year that at its peak—considered to be during the height of the pandemic—right-wing extremism accounted for around half of ASIO's counterterrorism workload. By February, this year that number had fallen to around 30 per cent who are ideologically motivated. Most of that is nationalist and racist violent extremism, he told Senate estimates. That 30 per cent is 30 per cent too much. I commend the federal government for bringing forward this bill, the Counter-Terrorism Legislation Amendment (Prohibited Hate Symbols and Other Measures) Bill 2023, which makes significant and necessary changes to the Commonwealth Criminal Code to support law enforcement in their efforts to manage and protect the community from anyone who is planning, preparing or working to inspire others to do harm.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Though the number of Tasmanians who identify as Jewish is small—the 2021 census recorded 376 Jewish people in the state, the smallest state population in the country—the community, like any other, deserves full protection from hate speech and discrimination. I was proud that our Tasmanian government, earlier this year, led the nation in implementing legislation that would prohibit Nazi symbols and salutes in our island state. Like the federal bill before us today, the legislation is careful to acknowledge the continued importance of the swastika to the Buddhist, Hindu, Jain and other communities of faith, and recognises the difference between the sacred swastika and the misappropriated Nazi hakenkreuz, which protects legitimate purposes for public display.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Importantly, this legislation also criminalises the public display of and trade in the Islamic State symbol, used by a terrorist organisation with a violent and hateful ideology, while also recognising the distinction between Islamic State and Islamic faith. With the rise in both Islamophobic and antisemitic incidents in Australia since 7 October, this support of both our Muslim communities and our Jewish communities in this country is more important than ever.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since being elected as the federal member for Bass around four and a half years ago, I've had the privilege of building relationships with my local Jewish community. I've had the honour of participating in the menorah lighting and Hanukkah celebrations in our city, and I have a deep admiration for Rabbi Yochanan Gordon. When this bill was originally presented to the House by the Attorney-General back in June, I reached out to Rabbi Gordon, keen as always to seek the advice of a local community who would be directly affected by this legislation. I was struck by his call for togetherness, unity and love for one another, no matter our background. I will read his words today:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Today, living in Australia, land of diverse cultures, we want to reaffirm our commitment to a society free from bigotry and hatred. In Tasmania, we have a number of descendants of Holocaust survivors and victims. As we work to pass this upcoming law, let us remember the lessons of history and vow to protect the values that bind us as a community.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Holocaust, one of the darkest chapters in human history, was orchestrated by the Nazi regime, which shamelessly adopted the swastika as a symbol of their warped vision of the Aryan race. This emblem, once an ancient symbol representing well-being and prosperity in various cultures, was perverted to propagate hatred and cruelty on an unimaginable scale. It is a chilling reminder of the destructive power of intolerance and discrimination.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Today, we stand to state that bigotry and hate have no place in our community. Each time the symbols of hatred, and specifically the swastika, are displayed, it threatens to fracture the very foundation of our multi-cultural society. We must do what we can against any attempts to resurrect the ghosts of the past and perpetuate ideologies that seek to divide us based on our differences.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Australia holds a special place in history as the first nation where being Jewish was not an impediment to reaching any position. Our nation has shown that inclusivity and diversity are not just buzzwords but the pillars of progress and prosperity. It is a testament to the strength of our society when we embrace our differences, harness our collective potential, and rise above discrimination.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">When someone displays a swastika today, they are not merely expressing an opinion or belief; they are advocating for the wholesale murder of innocent people. They are endorsing the use of gas chambers and ovens to annihilate fellow human beings solely because of their birthright and identity. This is an affront to the sanctity of life and the principles of compassion that underpin any civilized society.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">If we can focus and remember the stories of Holocaust survivors and the indomitable spirit they displayed amidst the darkest of circumstances. Their stories stand as a beacon of hope, reminding us that even in the face of unimaginable horror, humanity can rise above hatred and prejudice. As this bill is debated, we must not forget to also take up the responsibility to educate future generations about the consequences of hate and intolerance. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Education is our most potent weapon against hatred. By teaching our children about the Holocaust and other instances of human suffering caused by discrimination, we instil in them empathy, tolerance, and the resolve to stand up against injustice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Together, let us foster an environment where diversity is celebrated, and our differences are seen as strengths that enrich our society. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We must ensure that our legal systems protect the dignity and safety of all citizens and visitors alike. Let us work hand in hand to create a society where everyone can thrive, regardless of their ethnicity, religion, or background. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us not forget that there are people among us who lived through World War II and witnessed firsthand the atrocities committed under the Nazi regime, and for whom the symbol would still cause immense pain, including local constituents in northern Tasmania. These include people like Holocaust survivor Felix Goldschmied, who emigrated to Australia in 1948 as a young boy. Dr Goldschmied was born in what was then Czechoslovakia and lost most of his family members at Auschwitz. When attending the announcement of the establishment of a Holocaust education and interpretation centre in Hobart—an initiative spearheaded by then Treasurer Josh Frydenberg—Dr Goldschmied reflected that the establishment of an education centre was incredibly important, as he fears stories risk being forgotten as Jewish survivors grow old and take their memories of the war with them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then there is another Holocaust survivor in the northern Tasmanian community, Dr Gershon Goldstein. Dr Goldstein was born in the Netherlands during the war to a Dutch mother and a Jewish father. Like Dr Goldschmied, he lost many relatives in the Holocaust—around 100, in fact—including his father, grandmother, uncle, aunt, cousins, six great-uncles and two great-aunts. Dr Goldstein has spent years teaching students about the Holocaust and has long been campaigning for it to be taught more widely in the school curriculum, with a particular focus on countering antisemitism.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My thoughts have often gone to Dr Goldstein, Dr Goldschmied and the entire Jewish community, as we have seen the insignia see a resurgence as a propaganda tool for harassment and vilification of our Jewish communities. And so too have we seen both Nazi and Islamic state symbols used to target Muslims, non-Muslims, other religious minorities and other groups, including LGBTQI+. It is all abhorrent and must be stamped out. We must not be complacent, and this bill is a positive step to send a message to Australians that our parliament and our country will stand united against displays of ignorance and hate. This legislation also seeks to criminalise the use of a carriage service to deal with violent extremist material. It ensures that regulations that prescribe terrorist organisations do not lapse after three years but instead continue indefinitely unless revoked by the AFP minister, and it strengthens the advocating terrorism offence provisions. The latter recognise that advocating terrorism is a serious act that can lead to violence against innocent Australians, and the bill increases the maximum penalty for this offence from five to seven years imprisonment. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those seeking to promote their extremist views and recruit to their so-called cause are finding increasingly clever ways to do so, particularly seeking out younger people online and targeting vulnerable people who may feel isolated or disengaged from society. Last year, the AFP began urging parents and guardians to be aware of their child's online activities, noting that their own investigators had begun seeing evidence of extremist groups accessing popular online games in a bid to recruit young Australians and stating that they held serious concerns around the spread of extremist content in these platforms. AFP Acting Assistant Commissioner Counter Terrorism and Special Investigations Command Sandra Booth said the following:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We know that nationalist, racist and violent extremist content in online games is almost certainly part of a radicalisation process for some young people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">There are a number of popular games that enable users to create scenarios and record them for others to re-watch and share online across social media. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Our concern is extremist groups are exploiting these platform to target a very young group of Australia's population, by creating content to share and encourage far-right/extremist ideologies and abhorrent violence against others.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In his annual threat assessment last year, ASIO chief Mike Burgess also said that the agency is battling with the challenge of children increasingly becoming the target of extremist groups as they seek to radicalise others to join their cause. He said at the time:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">As the director-general of security, this trend is deeply concerning. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">As a parent, it is deeply distressing. As a nation, we need to reflect on why some teenagers are hanging Nazi flags and portraits of the Christchurch killer on their bedroom walls, and why others are sharing beheading videos. And just as importantly, we must reflect on what we can do about it. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Burgess is right: we need to look at why teenagers are getting involved in the first place and what we can do about it. The section in the bill which strengthens the advocating terrorism offence means it can certainly lead to a severe penalty, hopefully acting as a deterrent for potential offending or reoffending. But we must be looking at why anyone of any age becomes actively involved in advocating terrorism or using well-known hate symbols to target community groups and instil fear in others. As I mentioned in a speech on far-right extremism just a few months ago, I've pondered the effect of loneliness, isolation and the breakdown of community and what this means for our society for both men and women, with participation of women in right-wing extremism on the rise.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's alarming that in 2023 we would need to speak on banning hate symbols—some that we would never have expected to so openly show up in sections of our communities almost 80 years after the Second World War ended. As I mentioned earlier, even prior to the current conflict, antisemitic incidents were on the rise. But the conflict has given way to incidents in both the Jewish and the Islamic communities. Between 8 October and 7 November there were 221 reported cases of antisemitic incidents and 133 reported Islamophobic incidents in the same period. These incidents include threats to mosques and synagogues, graffiti, threats to Muslim and Jewish schools, spitting at women, verbal abuse and hate mail, just to name a few. We must do more to stamp out this hate. I want to end by repeating the words of Rabbi Gordon:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Together, let us foster an environment where diversity is celebrated, and our differences are seen as strengths that enrich our society.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Higgins</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:16</span>):  On a recent historic parliamentary visit to Israel with the Speaker of the House, I had the privilege of visiting Yad Vashem, the World Holocaust Remembrance Center. The place was teeming with visitors—school children, youth and elders—from across the world, coming to comprehend the incomprehensible. Through those black-and-white images, we gazed at faces with only moments to live or of those who had endured a purgatory between life and death waiting for a salvation that never came. Arresting was the Book of Names, a book filled with tiny writing listing the names and places of origin of those who died. This book was nearly the length of the room, with reams of blank pages. Why? For the known unknowns whose stories continue to seep out from the pages of history through testimonials from survivors, allies and upstanders around the world.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The children's memorial is particularly poignant, dedicated to 2½-year-old Uziel. It sits in a bunker-like structure akin to a place that children would hide in. It is as solemn as a tomb, but, once inside, a glistening multiplicity of candles blink within mirrors in homage to the 1.5 million children who died, some as old as half an hour. One in three of those children remains unknown but not forgotten in those flickers of light. Standing outside like a vanguard is a stylised version of a class photo—columns of varying heights but lopped at the top, symbolising lives cut short and futures terminated. If you can't get to Yad Vashem, its digital collection is worth viewing. We also have the Melbourne Holocaust Museum, its equivalent in Sydney and a new centre in Brisbane that are well worth a visit.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">How? How? How? Like a stone turning over in my hand, I kept asking this question on this tour. How did this happen? How could humans do this to their brothers and sisters? How was genocide committed under the nose of polite society as ash rained down in neighbourhoods, casually swept from doorsteps? Manipulation, misinformation, disinformation, fear, threats, excuses, the weakening of public institutions, media censorship, demagoguery, dehumanisation, experimentation, propaganda and scapegoating—these lessons from the past grab our shoulders, shaking us from our slumber and demanding that we pay attention.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Never did I think I would see the Nazi symbols and salutes on our streets in Melbourne, in inner-city suburbs and indeed on the steps of our Victorian state parliament. The rise of this movement has been alarming. It is repulsive to Australians, antisemitic, divisive and racist—a desecration of our values under the pretence of free speech. Free speech has its limits, especially when it threatens public safety—physical or psychological. Australia has a degree of social cohesion that is the envy of the world, but it has not happened by accident. It has been cultivated over decades, because of waves of migration, a strong democracy, universal access to education, and opportunities for social mixing in our schools, workplaces and sporting teams. We can't and won't take the bonds between us for granted. This is why we in the Albanese government are taking action to further strengthen democracy and protect our community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill creates new offences for publicly displaying prohibited Nazi and terrorist organisation symbols or trading in their use. The trading offence targets selling, renting or leasing these paraphernalia. Both offences are associated with a maximum of 12 months imprisonment. There are exemptions where a symbol is displayed for genuine religious worship or for academic, artistic or scientific purposes. Importantly, the sacred swastika used in the Buddhist, Hindu or Jain religious observances would be exempt.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 1 also amends the bill to criminalise performing the Nazi salute in a public place. This amendment is to address the significant harm toward the Australian community caused by the representation of a gesture which is fundamentally incompatible with Australia's multicultural, democratic and inclusive society. It is also a denouncement, in very clear terms, of antisemitism. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 2 of the bill would criminalise the use of a carriage service for violent extremist material. A carriage service would include a range of platforms including webpages, social media, email, chat forums and text messages. This measure would allow law enforcement to take action against people who are using the internet to recruit, spread propaganda or incite violence. The offence is associated with up to five years imprisonment. We are not going to make it easy to radicalise young people. Early intervention, with this provision, also provides greater opportunity for rehabilitation and diversion.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 3 of the bill criminalises instruction on how to perform an act of terrorism and criminalises praising the performance of a terrorist act, when there is a risk that the praise would be enabling. Again, we want to prevent the radicalisation of young people. The glorification of terrorism or terrorist acts can lead to copycat behaviour if it is not dealt with. In recognising that advocating for terrorism can incite like-minded behaviour, leading to widespread harm, we are increasing the maximum penalty for this offence also.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 4 removes sunsetting requirements around the listing of terrorist organisations. Of the 29 terrorist organisations currently listed, the majority have been relisted multiple times—some as many as eight. This change will streamline matters. Appeals can be made to the AFP minister if there is a case to delist an organisation. In addition, the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security would have the ability to conduct independent reviews regarding the appropriateness of these listings. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There will always be divisive forces trying to pry us apart. Sexism, antisemitism, extremism, homophobia and racism are a toxic family that is not welcome at our table. To those involved in these activities: I urge you to return to the normal rhythms of your lives—to your sporting teams, faith groups, workmates and families. This flawed search for identity and belonging will take you to a spiritual dead end, with buyer's remorse writ large—a buyer's remorse that is associated with criminal penalties and a moral debt that will reverberate throughout your lives, sweeping up your loved ones also.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Make no mistake: the Albanese government will do whatever it takes to defend our social cohesion by tackling antisemitic and terrorist symbols head-on. Once associated with genocide, these are again emerging on our streets and in our suburbs. If people don't know why these are so offensive and destabilising then they need to do their homework. Wilful ignorance is not an excuse. Get educated using the plethora of online tools. That same digital platform that spreads hate could—should—be a tool for enlightenment. The banning of these symbols will disrupt the marketplace of this extremist ideology. I commend this bill to the House.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr BATES:</span>
                  </a>  The federal government recently announced that $7 billion worth of infrastructure projects are facing the cut. As the population of this country continues to rise, infrastructure and development are nowhere near keeping up. This comes on the back of news this month that Brisbane City Council has cut more than $400 million from its budget. That is a 10 per cent cut—massive. This leaves multiple council projects on the chopping block, including suburban work such as active transport; road corridor updates; intersections and crossings; pedestrian upgrades and bikeways; community facilities such as sporting fields; park acquisitions and tree planting; and drainage, and there are job losses for up to 700 casual and contracted council workers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The LNP council, with the full support of Labor's five councillors, voted to give big developers a tax cut by cutting infrastructure charges that are specifically meant to support essential public services and infrastructure. There is so much opportunity for good quality local development in Brisbane, but all the council can offer is short-sighted cuts. We cannot just leave things to the private sector entirely. We've seen time and again, from the ABC studios in Toowong to Queens Wharf and Bulimba Barracks, that we get these promises for great social outcomes, but all too often they end up getting whittled down and eventually disappear altogether once private developers get the land.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One potential development area in Brisbane that I'd like to highlight is the Petrie Terrace and Caxton Street precinct. This precinct has serious potential, but to realise that potential we need to move beyond making decisions site by site and start thinking about what our whole neighbourhood could look like in 10 years time. Victoria Barracks, for instance, is a prime spot for renewal. It's right next to the CBD, Roma Street and Barrambin. It's got public transport access and shops. Victoria Barracks could be reinvented as a thriving community precinct. But we cannot leave this redevelopment to the private sector. Once private developers have control of the Victoria Barracks site, it becomes a lot more expensive to build community infrastructure or social housing there, and neither the community, council nor the state government will have adequate leverage to deliver socially beneficial outcomes, including things like green space, connectivity, art space and affordable housing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've seen what happens over time when the government leaves the supply of affordable housing to the private sector. Government reduces the amount of social and public housing they provide, and we end up where we are now, with housing affordability at its worst level in at least three decades. But it doesn't have to be this way. The Queensland government spent $448 million in assistance to the fossil fuel industry last financial year, and the federal government's stage 3 tax cuts for Australia's wealthiest will cost $20.4 billion in the first year alone, rising every year to $42.9 billion a year within the next decade. It's no wonder there's a growing public disconnection with politics when these are the government's priorities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Relentless cost-of-living pressure, rising interest rates, uncertainty about the direction of the economy and growing concern about inequality have undermined Australia's sense of social cohesion—that's the conclusion of the social cohesion index's latest research, which was released earlier this month. Each year the <span style="font-style:italic;">Mapping </span><span style="font-style:italic;">s</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ocial </span><span style="font-style:italic;">c</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ohesion</span> report, compiled by the Scanlon Foundation, provides a barometer of social wellbeing. It measures belonging, worth, participation, acceptance, rejection, social inclusion and justice. In the last 12 months, the index has fallen four points to now be at its lowest level since the report began 16 years ago. Sustained financial pressure has had a massive impact on social cohesion in Australia. Now, this will come as a surprise to no-one, but the report revealed that we are overwhelmingly worried about our household budgets, about housing affordability and about the state of the economy. Thirty-six per cent of people said the government could be trusted to do the right thing, and the number of people saying they feel socially isolated has increased. So why is this?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the last few decades we have witnessed the government retreat from the economy, with everything sold off to the highest bidder. At the same time, we have lived through a period of immense atomisation. Communities have fallen away and been replaced with a society built solely on the principles of the market. With those principles, life becomes a zero sum. Our society suffers and our economy suffers. We must undo this. It is not sustainable—not for our planet and not for one another. We must undo the decades of government policies that have created a society where inequality is rampant, isolation is encouraged and loneliness is expected. We know that a vast plurality of inflation is being driven by corporate superprofits—coal and gas, Coles and Woolies, all making off with huge profits while Australians are struggling to keep a roof over their heads.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to build a society and economy that works for all of us, not just those at the top. We do this by putting people before profit, by building a universal support system—scrapping the stage 3 tax cuts that immensely benefit the wealthiest people in this country at the expense of everyone else. Instead, we need to create free uni and TAFE. We need to wipe student debt. We need to bring dental and mental health into Medicare and make sure our state schools are fully funded and the envy of the world. We need to raise the rate of JobSeeker, youth allowance and all other income support payments to above the poverty line, because all of us deserve a life of dignity and respect. We need a direct build of public housing in Australia, a cap on rent increases and limits to negative gearing to fix our broken housing system. A house should be a home; it should not be a speculative commodity. And, of course, we must tackle climate change with the urgency that is required. That means no new coal and gas, an end to fossil fuel subsidies, and 100 per cent publicly owned renewable energy. And we can get there. The government cannot and will not get away with telling people that they've taken appropriate measures to tackle the cost-of-living crisis while everyone feels materially worse off. People are crying out for systemic change that genuinely improves their lives, and it is well beyond time that we delivered that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All of my adult life, until being elected into this place, I have worked in retail and hospitality jobs, both here in Australia and overseas. I know what it's like to watch your super creep up so very slowly that you start to wonder what is even the point. Some people in retail, hospitality and many other industries never even receive super payments, and this is akin to wage theft. The Greens have secured important amendments to the Fair Work Legislation Amendment (Closing Loopholes) Bill that will improve the government's proposed changes to our industrial relations system. These come in addition to provisions which seek to address and remedy wage theft and labour hire loopholes and ensure minimum standards for gig economy workers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australian workers are currently robbed of at least $3.3 billion in superannuation each year. Super is not an optional extra; it is a workplace entitlement that protects a decent life in retirement for millions of Australians. Victims of super theft are disproportionately young, low-paid or migrant workers. They are most commonly workers in accommodation and food services, retail and construction. Many of these workers don't have the resources or the time to hire a lawyer and fight in the courts for their basic legal entitlements across various pieces of obscure legislation. The Greens have secured an important amendment so that stealing super can be criminalised in workplace law. This amendment will reduce super theft and deliver justice for millions of workers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another area the Greens are pushing for progress in is the right for workers to switch off. Over recent years, there has been an incessant creep of availability, where we feel the need to respond to messages outside of work hours, driven partly by technology which has put the office in our pockets 24/7. The pressure on workers to be available at all hours, particularly when working remotely, has serious implications for mental and physical health and increases work related stress. Australian workers do an excessive amount of unpaid overtime, in large part because we're always contactable. In fact, the average Australian worker performs six weeks of unpaid overtime per year. Workers should have the right to turn off their phones, block their boss's calls and switch off their emails when they have finished work for the day.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr NEUMANN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Blair</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:45</span>):  In the area of health, there is no greater priority for the Albanese Labor government than rebuilding general practice, and that's why the centrepiece of the May budget was a commitment to strengthening Medicare, with $6.1 billion of initiatives, including a tripling of the bulk-billing incentive, the largest investment in bulk-billing in the history of Medicare. This historic investment is making it easier for more than 28,000 children and their families and more than 77,000 pensioners and concession card holders—more than 105,000 patients in total—to see a GP at more than 50 GP practices that bulk-bill in my electorate. That's a very important investment in the May budget. On top of this investment in bulk-billing, we have invested a $1.5 billion indexation boost across the board in Medicare rebates, increasing the amount that doctors receive for medical services and reducing the pressure on GPs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Ipswich region, in my electorate, is continuing to grow, and it is often difficult to get to see a GP. This is particularly an issue in peri-urban areas and small country towns on the fringes of Ipswich, like Walloon. Prior to July 2022, the Rosewood GP catchment, which Walloon Medical Centre falls in, was classified as a non-distribution priority area, or non-DPA. DPA status allows medical practices to recruit from a large pool of location restricted doctors, including overseas trained doctors, and improves access to GP services in areas of need where there are workforce shortages. The July 2022 update, as part of Labor's election commitment to improve access to GP services in outer metropolitan areas where workforce shortages had been identified, gave the entire Rosewood GP catchment DPA status. That is very welcome. In opposition, I fought to make it easier for the Walloon Medical Centre and others like it to recruit more doctors to service the local area. This was a great outcome after years of advocacy on behalf of these practices.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, despite the DPA change, it is still classified as being in a metropolitan area under the Department of Health and Aged Care's Modified Monash Model, or MMM, which makes it harder to attract doctors to work long-term at the surgery. What this shows is that the DPA changes the Albanese government made after the election were good for some clinics in my electorate, which are now able to attract more GPs, but not for others. The Walloon example highlights what a complex issue this is. It shows why DPA status in and of itself is not a silver bullet. The government funds a range of programs and incentives to encourage GPs to relocate to rural and regional areas in addition to the DPA, like the Modified Monash Model. So we need to look at other levers like this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why I was so pleased to see the announcement of a wide-ranging government review to urgently investigate how to secure a more equitable distribution of doctors and health workers around the country. The Working Better for Medicare review was announced by the Minister for Health and Aged Care last week and will look at how current policies and programs can be strengthened to make it easier to see a doctor, nurse or other health professional in the outer suburbs of major cities and in regional, rural and remote Australia. The review will look at Medicare's role in locating the workforce as well as the three main policy levers used to distribute the workforce: the MMM, the District of Workforce Shortage classification and the DPA.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The review will identify ways to improve health access for Australians by building a more stable, motivated and properly located workforce. The aim is to have an appropriately located workforce, particularly in areas that find it difficult to attract and keep doctors, so that all Australians can access the care they need when they need it, regardless of where they choose to live. The Working Better for Medicare review will be led by nurse advocate and remote health expert Professor Sabina Knight and former senior health bureaucrat and academic Mick Reid. It will be underpinned by extensive stakeholder engagement, with findings expected to be provided to the government in mid-2024.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Working Better for Medicare review will build on other work to strengthen Medicare, like Professor Mark Cormack's <span style="font-style:italic;">U</span><span style="font-style:italic;">nleashing the potential of our </span><span style="font-style:italic;">health </span><span style="font-style:italic;">workforce</span>, which will ensure that, whenever they work, every health professional can provide every bit of their skills, training and expertise. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that the Albanese government is committed to making Medicare stronger and improving access to health care, which is something I fought for in my electorate for 16 years. The reality is that when we came to government there had been nine years of cuts to and neglect of Medicare from the LNP, including when the opposition leader was health minister, and it was harder and more expensive than ever to see a GP, particularly for people in outer-metro and regional electorates like mine. As I mentioned earlier, we made the largest investment in bulk-billing in the history of Medicare and we made it cheaper to see a doctor. I am hopeful the Working Better for Medicare review will make it easier, not just cheaper, for patients in my regional electorate to see a doctor. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The levers we have to spread doctors and health workers around the country are from very different times, before the COVID-19 pandemic and the global health workforce crunch. The government will use all possible levers to encourage doctors and other health workers to be where patients need them—outside of cities and in areas of need. I'm delighted the minister has initiated the review and I hope it can make it easier for practices like the Walloon Medical Centre to recruit more doctors. But going forward we need to look at a range of other issues that impact the health workforce and the supply and distribution of doctors and health professionals. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to encourage more Australian medical students to train as GPs and we need to promote the rewards of serving the community outside inner-city areas. On the weekend I caught up with another GP, who is from Kilcoy in the far north of my electorate, in the upper Somerset region. He told me that unless he can access a locum most days it's just him at the practice and that he struggled to recruit another doctor for about two years, as many young GPs simple don't want to work in rural areas. For him, DPA and MMM are all but irrelevant. He really needs someone who's prepared to commit to a country practice and enjoy that lifestyle. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The recent Royal Australian College of General Practitioners' health of the nation report found that GPs are seeing more patients than ever, that the GP workforce needs an urgent boost and that mental health is a growing issue. The college has said that general practice sustainability needs to be addressed to prevent practice closures impacting communities across the country, with four out of five practice owners concerned about the viability of their practice, and that urgent action is needed to boost the general practice workforce across the country to ensure GPs can meet patient needs now and in the future. The report argues that we are facing a looming shortfall of GPs and that we need to do much more to attract and retain this essential workforce. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The RACGP have put forward a range of suggestions to boost the workforce. They've identified that GPs are hamstrung due to discrepancies in conditions and pay between hospitals and private practices. This is a significant barrier to becoming a GP, but they suggest it could be addressed by investment in three key measures: introducing an incentive payment in the first six months of community general practice training; study leave; and paid parental leave for GPs in training. The college have argued that addressing these three barriers would make an immediate difference in getting GPs training and working in communities like mine that need them. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Others have suggested raising the status of the speciality within our medical schools. The RACGP report found that just 10 per cent of GPs are interested in becoming a practice owner and that four out of five current owners are concerned about the viability of their practices. So we really need more GPs to aspire to become practice owners as well in order to have a strong and sustainable general practice sector. It's the only way we can do it. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One way the government is helping in this area is by wiping HELP debts for doctors and nurse practitioners who live and work in rural and remote areas of Australia. Under this initiative, doctors and nurse practitioners who choose to live and work in areas where they are needed will have their HELP debt wiped or reduced. The HELP debt reduction for a doctor or nurse practitioner will depend on their length of service, their course of study, the amount of HELP debt they have outstanding, and when they commenced eligible services in an eligible location.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While the amount of the benefit will vary, some doctors who live and work in rural and remote parts of Australia could save up to $70,000, and a nurse practitioner could save up to $20,000. These changes are a win-win for doctors and nurse practitioners, and I encourage more of this from the government. They particularly benefit areas like rural Ipswich and the rural Somerset region. Zero HELP debt is a great incentive for young graduates to live and work and build their careers in rural and remote areas. These measures would make country practice a most attractive long-term career option. We expect it will attract 850 doctors and nurse practitioners every year across the country. Many parts of my electorate experience skills shortages in key professions, including of doctors and nurse practitioners. It would be a huge benefit to communities like Esk, Toogoolawah, Coominya and other areas around, as well as Lowood.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span style="font-style:italic;">
                  </span>There's more to do, and the Albanese government is working to improve health care. I look forward to the result of this review. I think it will be a game changer and I hope the government listens carefully to the views of the college and rural doctors. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="281688" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr WEBSTER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mallee</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:55</span>):  I rise to air my grievance with Labor's treatment of Australian farmers. Labor is punishing farmers in almost every conceivable way. It is nigh on impossible to know where to begin when it comes to the Albanese government's disregard for our primary producers, who feed and clothe not only our nation but the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just one example is Labor's fresh food tax. Labor is taxing farmers by forcing them to pay for the biosecurity risks created by international importers. This is an unbelievable insult to Australian farmers, who work so hard to mitigate biosecurity risks on their own farms at their own expense. Now, thanks to Labor, they will pay for the biosecurity risks of their competitors who import from overseas. When the cost of Australian food goes up at the check-out, Australians can thank Labor.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They are scrapping the ag visa—another one. Australia's top peak food industry bodies warned that agriculture required an additional 172,000 workers, yet only around 16,000 Pacific Australia Labour Mobility—PALM—workers have arrived since Labor took office 18 months ago. Make no mistake: the shortfall in workforce lowers productivity. Labor refuses to reinstate the Nationals' ag visa, a scheme all producers agreed was a fantastic idea and a much needed solution. Meanwhile, Labor has changed the PALM scheme and has made the farming workforce more difficult and costly for farmers, ultimately making it more expensive to get product from paddock to plate. Farmers simply can't get the workers they need, and under Labor's regime farmers are forced to offer a minimum of 30 hours a week despite agriculture work being seasonal, strangely enough, and weather dependent. In short, Labor's agriculture policies are making food more expensive.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You might have noticed at the check-out that Labor is forging ahead with water buybacks—who thought that was a good idea?—removing the economic and social safeguards of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan to give an additional 450 gigalitres out of the consumptive pool to the environment. The Nationals had all basin states agree on the social and economic neutrality test, protecting our regional communities. Reverting to buybacks for an additional 450 gigalitres will hurt our regional communities, as they did the last time they were instituted, leaving a patchwork quilt of barren and irrigated land. Once again, this will drive up food prices when families do their weekly shop.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just this week, we saw Labor and their city-based environmental activist friends in the Greens team up to revise the Basin Plan. The deal ensures the Water Act amendments will pass the Senate, mandating the full recovery of the 450 gigalitres of additional environmental water by the end of the 2027, despite strong objections from the national and Victorian farmers federations and the Victorian Labor government. Regional communities will be left to foot the bill for this power play aimed at securing city votes, a common thread when it comes to the Albanese Labor government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Renewable energy policies: my goodness, what can I say about that? Labor's reckless race to 82 per cent renewables by 2030 and 28,000 kilometres of transmission lines that they are running across Australia are like a wrecking ball through native vegetation and prime agricultural land. Mallee farmers are experiencing this first hand, with the VNI West project threatening their livelihoods for the sake of an ideology which is putting our food and fibre production at risk. Chopping down thousands of hectares of native bushland and pristine farmland for wind farms and transmission lines is senseless. I say this to Labor: Mallee is not your dumping ground for bad policy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Minister Bowen wants to back a five-fold increase in renewable energy capacity in Australia, but that risks the stability of the grid—all at the taxpayers' expense. Our farmers must be protected against their land being impinged on by reckless renewable energy transmission lines or mining projects with no social licence. I met with farmers at Dooen, in the Wimmera region of Mallee, whose lands and livelihoods are in the sights of a mining company—I won't name them—that at this point does not have social licence. It is World Soil Day on 5 December, and, while critical minerals are important, mining for them through premium topsoil should not risk agricultural productivity and our farming community's way of life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, across the country we have seen other Labor policies and chaotic thought bubbles play havoc with the confidence of farmers. In Western Australia we saw cultural heritage laws facing strong opposition from farmers whose land was put at risk, forcing an embarrassing backflip. Regional councils in Mallee, as well as private would-be tourism operators—such as Murray and Maree Allan at Sea Lake in my electorate—are facing similar economic ruin. Land deals between the state government and local land councils need to be investigated so they do not impinge on people's rights to work on and improve their own property. But Labor's storm of chaos for farmers goes on. Forcing farmers to pay for the unrealised capital gain of their properties in superannuation funds, delays to an infrastructure review and critical regional projects, moving towards the banning of the live sheep export trade, delays acting on foot and mouth disease, a lack of impetus to finalise meat labelling and not progressing with the domestic regulation of organics: these are all plaguing our farmers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know many in this House do not represent regional Australia. Their constituents don't make a living off the land, nor are they at the mercy of the seasons to get a crop in and out of the ground. They might be sitting there thinking that farmers are just whingers. No, they're not. For many MPs, these farmers are out of sight and out of mind. People in the city need to realise the impact of poor policy and what it means to farmers and farming and how that impacts, finally, at the grocery check-out for them personally.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When you effectively tie a farmer's hands behind their back and hurt their productivity or make it more expensive for them to operate, it is your own budget bottom line or back pocket that will be affected. When city folk go to the clothes shop or the meat and dairy aisle at Woolies or Coles or wherever they shop, they aren't thinking of a farmer at the other end of that transaction. Where is the food on their table or in their children's lunchbox at school coming from if not from Australian farmers? We certainly don't want it to be coming from overseas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Supporting our farmers starts with good government policy. The Albanese Labor government, consisting mostly of urban based politicians, needs to recognise the value of those who work the land beyond Australia's city limits. These farmers might not vote Labor, but the country relies on them being able to do their job, both to serve the domestic market and to bring the export dollars back to our nation. We must keep our farmers farming.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BURNS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macnamara</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:04</span>):  Over the past few months, I have seen just how important our early education system is, not only for the services that it provides for our youngest Australians but for the community as well. Since coming to government, early education has been a real priority of the Albanese government. It's looking to make it more affordable for families, looking to make sure that women who are working are not disincentivised by the cost of early education and looking to make sure that those women seeking to work full time, and any other parent, are able to do so in a way where that extra day's pay, or extra couple of day's pay, is not completely eaten up by the cost of early education.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Early education is also so essential for our youngest Australians. We know that the impact it has on our youngest Australians is profound. We know the social skills, the education skills, the interactions and the life lessons, and the brain development that occurs in those early years, are fundamental. In July we made early education more affordable for around 1.2 million Australian families. We made a commitment to the Australian people to deliver on early education, and we are doing just that. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the plan for cheaper child care, the government has lifted the maximum childcare subsidy rate, and this has improved the cost of early learning and dropped the costs for families. We understand the importance of valuing and recognising our early educators. They are incredibly skilled, hardworking and dedicated professional Australians, and we know the impact that they have on our youngest Australians as well. We have helped to deliver the industrial relations settings that will lead to more significant pay rises for our early educators. We are funding university for early education teachers and fee-free TAFE. We know they're doing vital work, we know they do an important job, and we're going to make sure that they are paid accordingly. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are the broad settings and the context that I provide for my remarks in this debate tonight. We know how important early education is and we know that it is important that governments work together to deliver these services. But I want to talk about something that's going on in my own community of Macnamara right now. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The city of Glen Eira is one of my municipalities. It's the municipality that I grew up in and have spent most of my life living in. I now live in the city of Port Phillip, but I am in the city of Glen Eira every other day. It's a beautiful part of Melbourne. The City of Glen Eira are, for the most part, an extremely competent council. They run very good services and they do an excellent job on behalf of the people of Glen Eira. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the things that they do is run a number of early education services, which they have made a preliminary decision to close—and they shouldn't. They shouldn't close these services. These services are brilliant. They provide an excellent standard of education for our little people who go there. They exceed the national quality standards. I am proud of them, and they mean a lot to our community. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To demonstrate how much they mean to the community, upon realising and hearing the news that the council had made a decision to close these centres, the community has responded in the most extraordinary way. They have organised, they have raised their voices and they have worked together to ensure that the educators and the kids who attend these early education centres are recognised for the important places that they are and the important work that they do—because they do more than just provide essential care for our children. They have been vital places for our local community for years. But, on 3 October this year, all the parents and staff at the Glen Eira early learning centres were informed that the council made a preliminary decision to close the centres before Christmas. There was no consultation. The decision came out of absolutely nowhere. That's not what our families deserve. At no point did the City of Glen Eira contact me, any other federal member of parliament, or any of the state members of parliament, seeking some form of support or raising any issues around the funding arrangements for these early learning centres. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The City of Glen Eira have made funding requests to the federal government. They made a request of $15 million for the Carnegie pool. That is a great community asset. The federal government made a commitment, and we delivered on our commitment to help fund the Carnegie pool. But the City of Glen Eira are not just running a pool. These services are about investing in the future of our community. They're about the future of these young people who attend. They're about the early educators who have worked for them—some of them for decades—servicing our local area. It is shattering that the Glen Eira City Council could be so dismissive of the impact of brazenly making the decision to shut these centres, and they did it without considering the impacts on our local community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">How do the parents feel? Emiko is a mother of two, and her three-year-old son is at the Caulfield Early Learning Centre in my electorate. She was planning to increase his days at the centre next year, and her one-year-old daughter is enrolled to start in January. Emiko does not have any other options for her children. Waiting lists for other centres are full. Emiko wanted to return to work next year at a new job, but, if she can't find a centre to look after her children, she will have to sacrifice her own career ambitions, and that is simply not good enough. As Emiko herself said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We're in tears thinking about having to tell my son that the centre that he's essentially grown up in, with a carer who he adores, that he might not be able to go there next year. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Berrin, another parent, has his two oldest children at Caulfield Early Learning Centre. He's been in the process of enrolling his younger child for more days so he can return to full-time work as well, and he'd planned to send his six-month-old there next year. He said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I was flabbergasted. I do not understand—first of all that they could make the decision, and then say they're convening for consultation. But also all the other childcare centres have already done their enrolments for next year. We have three kids. How are we going to get them in the same place?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Emiko and Berrin are just two of the parents that I'm talking about right now. There have been so many other engaged, passionate and fantastic parents who have lobbied the council and raised their voice. The parents rallied together to let the council know that the preliminary decision to close these centres was the wrong decision. They put together an online petition which has currently got more than 7,000 signatures, which is an extraordinary achievement by the parents. They organised a rally of more than 100 families outside town hall, which I attended, and they sent a strong message to the councillors that they need to reconsider their decision to shut these centres. They collected over 2,000 physical signatures to deliver a physical petition to the council. They've worked with me, my parliamentary colleagues from the Liberal Party, Independents and state members—unfortunately the Greens have not joined our campaign—and they have put together a 40-page report filled with the voices of parents, children and the broader community, as well as detailed alternatives and pathways that the council could consider to help save these centres.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This decision is taking a huge toll on staff. We know that early learning education is a traditionally difficult, low-paid and female dominated sector. We know that we need to do more for our workers. We know that we need to support early learning educators, not take away their jobs as the council is deciding to do. And the council are model employers. The City of Glen Eira is a great employer. They do a fantastic job of looking after their people, and it is no surprise that they have a dedicated staff who enjoy really good pay and conditions that are considerable to many others in the industry. I would implore Glen Eira to think about the impact that they're having on their own people who have served them and their council for so long.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The overwhelming number of parents in our local community believe that this is the wrong decision, and they have asked the councillors to, at their upcoming meeting, consider the impact of their decision and reconsider their decision of closing these centres. They do not need to close these centres. What they can do is push back the starting date and enter into negotiations in good faith with state and federal governments. We are here to talk in good faith. We are here to speak with the council. We are here to look for a way in which we can support them to keep these services open because we need quality education services for our young Australians. These are quality education services. They're fantastic community assets in the City of Glen Eira, and it would be so short-sighted if the councillors of the City of Glen Eira were to throw away this community asset. I'll be with the parents every step of the way to save these centres.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr RICK WILSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">O'Connor</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:14</span>):  Mr Deputy Speaker, I'm not sure you'll enjoy my contribution tonight, but I know who will, and they are the members of the North Eastern Wheatbelt Regional Organisation of Councils. They represent a large area of O'Connor that supplies shipping wethers to the live sheep export trade. Caroline Robinson, Quentin Davies and Tony Sachse, the president of the Shire of Mt Marshall, have been walking the halls of Parliament House today, speaking to all sides of parliament about the dire predicament of the live sheep export industry, and I welcome Tony here tonight in the Federation Chamber at the end of what I'm sure has been a productive day. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the aftermath of the collapse of the Western Australian Labor government's animal cruelty charges against WA's premier live sheep exporter, Emanuel Exports, it's time we review the events leading up to this humiliating backdown by the WA government. While the official government line is that it was not in the public interest to pursue the charges, the truth points to something more sinister. The prosecution's key witness, Fazal Ullah, had disappeared, causing the case to collapse. This should have signalled the end of the protracted, extremely expensive and vexatious litigation claim initiated by the former WA minister for agriculture, Alannah MacTiernan, following the tragic events of August 2017, when 2,400 sheep perished aboard the <span style="font-style:italic;">Awassi Express</span> in the Persian Gulf.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Instead, it has reignited the 'cash for cruelty' claims that followed the airing of the April 2018 <span style="font-style:italic;">60 </span><span style="font-style:italic;">M</span><span style="font-style:italic;">inutes</span> exclusive 'Sheep, ships and videotapes', based on an interview with a Pakistani deckhand, Fazal Ullah, who filmed the horrific footage and became infamously known as the whistleblower. Animals Australia publicly maintain they never paid cash for footage of animal suffering, but it has been widely publicised that Mr Ullah received over A$100,000 in payments directly from Animals Australia under the guise of wages, expenses and scholarships for him to study in Victoria—even a scholarship for his sister to study at the university of Islamabad.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have seen a letter Lyn White wrote to Fazal Ullah's mother and family, and it is entirely consistent with grooming behaviour. She describes herself as an ex-policewoman now leading an international Australia-based animal charity, Animals Australia. In this letter she describes Fazal Ullah as an 'extraordinarily rare human being … to observe the suffering of these animals and realise to the depths of his soul that this was wrong'. She also said that she 'promised Fazal that I will be by his side every step of the way, providing guidance and support … and change for the better will come through our efforts'—fine sentiments indeed. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">However, I have in my possession bank statements that show that multiple Australian individuals transferred a total of over $37,000 from Australia bank accounts to Mr Ullah's Middle Eastern bank accounts in Pakistan, Dubai and Sydney, an act that could only have been facilitated by Animals Australia. I have also seen an affidavit by the second whistleblower, Mahmood Raza Mazher, who describes exactly how the <span style="font-style:italic;">60 </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Minutes</span> footage is likely to have been created. Mr Mazher provides details of communication between himself and Fazal Ullah towards securing a mobile phone and filming footage on board. Ullah was by then no longer working on board as a result of prior acts of animal cruelty, including beating a cow with a wooden pole. Under the alias of Mubashir, the name of a former <span style="font-style:italic;">Awassi</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> Express</span> deckhand, Mr Mazher also communicated directly with Animals Australia's Director Lyn White. The emails they exchanged are damning and show Animals Australia grooming two cash-strapped deckhands and financially incentivising their filming of animal suffering.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BRIAN MITCHELL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyons</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:24</span>):  Improving access to quality health care in Lyons has been a core issue for me since my election in 2016. That's why I'm so pleased to report to the House that construction of a new GP clinic, in the Brighton municipality in the south of my electorate, is well underway. I promised at the 2022 election to deliver this clinic and I'm keeping that promise. The $1.6 million of Australian government funding has been vital to secure this much-needed medical service for the fast-growing Brighton community. Sited next to the wonderful Brighton Bowls and Community Club, the new GP clinic is on course to open in mid next year, and, like the community, I'm looking forward to the doors opening and medical services getting underway.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While I'm on the topic of health, I'd like to report to the House that the Australian government played a pivotal role in retaining GP services in Bridgewater, which is nearby Brighton. When the operators of the Greenpoint Medical Services announced they would close their clinic in December, it understandably sent shockwaves throughout Bridgewater. Many of the 8,000 people on the clinic's books, including the elderly and many suffering from chronic health conditions, feared they would be unable to secure alternative medical services. When I relayed news of the impending closure to the office of the Minister for Health and Aged Care, Mark Butler, no stone was left unturned to help find a solution. Officials were dispatched, and many phone calls were made to a range of stakeholders to find an alternative provider of medical services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A few weeks ago, all the hard work paid off, with Your Hobart Doctor announcing it was taking over the business. Your Hobart Doctor is a well-credentialled provider of health services in the south of Tasmania and runs the federally funded urgent care clinic in Hobart's Bathurst Street. I'd like to thank officials, as well as the federally funded HR+ Tasmania—the Tasmanian branch of the Rural Workforce Agency—and Primary Health Tasmania for their important work. Minister Butler's office provided invaluable assistance, and we now look forward to a smooth transition to the new owners in early December and a rebranding from Greenpoint Medical Services to Jordan River Medical Services. The new owners are hopeful of providing more services and staff and extended hours, which will be terrific for this community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Losing this clinic was never an acceptable option for me or the Bridgewater community that I represent. When some outside the community shrugged their shoulders and said that patients might just have to change their doctor, I said that was not acceptable and Bridgewater must not lose its access to primary health services full stop. I'd like to congratulate local mum Melissa Tyrrell for her hard work as a community campaigner and for bringing people together to keep this service. Melissa never got angry, but she was always determined. And I'll also give a shout-out to my state Labor colleague Jen Butler—no relation to Mark—for her tireless advocacy and for holding Tasmania's Liberal health minister to account. The retention of this service is a victory first and foremost for the people of Bridgewater. They can be rightly proud of the role they played in ensuring this service stayed in the community, where it belongs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As well as some local wins in the area of health, the Albanese Labor government has made the largest investment in bulk billing in the 40-year history of Medicare—taking effect on 1 November—with the tripling of the bulk-billing incentive for local GPs. Bulk billing is the beating heart of Medicare, and, after nine years of cuts and neglect by the former government, bulk-billing rates have declined sharply and it's never been harder or more expensive for Australians to see a GP. Now children, seniors and Australians with a concession card will find it easier to find a bulk-billing doctor. Labor's cheaper medicines policy has saved patients on average $12 per script on the 36,000 60-day scripts dispensed in my electorate from January to August this year. And, of course, the 60-day scripts came in in a staggered way in September, and they'll be rolling out further later on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's over $400,000 that's been returned to my constituents. By the end of the year, Tasmania will have a fourth Medicare urgent care clinic. It will open in Devonport, allowing patients in the north-west of the state to seek urgent medical attention for non-life-threatening situations that might not warrant a visit to the emergency department. And a visit to an urgent care clinic is all on the Medicare card. You don't need a credit card, and there are no fees; it's all bulk billed. This clinic in Devonport will ease the pressure on the Mersey Community Hospital, just as the one in Launceston is easing the pressure on the LGH and as the two in Hobart are having an impact on the Royal Hobart Hospital's overworked emergency department.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is just the start. As the Tasmanian Liberal minority government struggles to manage and support its hospitals, Labor's federally funded urgent care clinics are already proving themselves and relieving the strain. I've got to say that I hope to see one of these urgent care clinics in my electorate. I make no make no bones about that. I'm very happy to go out there and push for it, as I have been. These urgent care clinics have been a raging success as they've rolled out across the country. I know that money is always limited and that every MP will have their hand up for one of these, but I think my Lyons community deserves an urgent care clinic, and I'm out there fighting to have one in Lyons.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government is committed to improving health care for all Australians whether they live in the cities or in the regions. I'll end on this note. Labor built Medicare. We are proud of Medicare, and only Labor will protect Medicare.</span>
