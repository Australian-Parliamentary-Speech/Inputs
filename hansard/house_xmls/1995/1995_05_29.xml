        That this House expresses its extreme concern at the failure, after twelve years, of the federal Government to provide a world competitive transport system for the nation, in particular, (a) heavily overtaxing fuel notwithstanding the enormous distances freight has to travel, (b) failure to achieve uniform national regulations for road transport, (c) underinvesting in transport infrastructure, (d) failure to provide fair retail pricing for fuel in country regions, (e) failure to develop a competitive national rail freight service despite promises to do so five years ago and (f) despite expenditure of $430 million our performance on the waterfront continues to fall further behind our competitors and that as a consequence regional development has been stifled while exports have been denied the chance to reach their full potential.

       For 12 years we have seen a government that has been big on selling and short on vision. It has been big on rhetoric and short on long-term planning. Transport is one of the main areas of arrogant shortsightedness. Over the 12 years where gains could have been made we have seen nothing but a decline.

        Today I will examine several key areas in which I believe this government has allowed our transport system to be far less than world competitive. In fact, it has allowed us to fall behind, meaning that every Australian is suffering. I will look at six areas: fuel tax, the lack of uniform regulations, infrastructure investment, country fuel prices, rail freight and the waterfront.

        I start with fuel tax. We see that tax on fuel has been marked by nothing but adhockery and a constant increase. The government has continued to extract more and more tax from fuel users while spending less and less on roads. In fact, when Labor came to power in 1983, over 60 per cent of fuel tax was spent on roads. Today, less than 10 per cent of fuel tax is used by the Commonwealth for road funding. Looking at what has happened in real terms is even more startling. Using 1992-93 prices, we find that back in 1982-83 road funding was over $1,400 million whereas today it is $795 million. That is almost half the figure of 12 years ago.

       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        Since 1990, when we had all those election promises and One Nation programs, road funding has dropped by a staggering two-thirds. By maintaining very high costs of fuel, the transport costs for all production rise. There is an indirect price flow-on to consumer goods, which hits all Australians—not just at the petrol bowser but also at the shops.

        The second area I look at is that of regulation. This is a very sorry tale. In 1983 there was an inquiry. In 1984 we had a report. The government said that that report would be put in place by 1988. Of course, that didn't happen. In 1991 we had another promise that it would all be in place by 1995. Now the government is going to have to defer again. Why? It is not because it can blame the states, but because the federal government itself still has not got its own legislation in place, despite all these years—12 years later.

        If we look at the performance of the National Road Transport Commission, which started off very well and produced some excellent reports, we find that, as usual, the government has failed to act and it is now seen as little more than an area for a lot of talk. When we look at this whole question of road reform, we see the priority that the government gives it, because it is not even the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) who is taking responsibility nowadays, it is a parliamentary secretary. The member for Burke (Mr O'Keefe) is a nice chap but he does not have a lot of clout. He is only a parliamentary secretary. Of course, what has really happened is that we are seeing the monkey being sent in to do the job instead of the organ grinder—the organ grinder being none other than Dangerman, who is obviously too busy spending too much time screwing up industrial relations.

        One little example illustrates it perfectly. Eight months ago, when the drought got too much for one Queensland cattle producer, he went to arrange for a livestock transporter to take the cattle interstate. The transporter found that he met all the regulations in Queensland. He checked it out with New South Wales and the answer came back by fax that it was okay. He checked out Western Australia and the answer came back by fax that it was okay. South Australia said, `No, you'd have to bring your truck down here and we'll have to inspect it before you can do it.' Not surprisingly, he decided that he would take the risk. He got caught at Ceduna. He had to take the truck back to Port Augusta to have a quick inspection, pick up a fine and go on with his job. What better illustration do we have as to how much this government has failed in its move to get uniform regulations.

        This whole performance means that we have a government of perpetual announcement. We get announcement after announcement, inquiry after inquiry, always with a long time frame for these announcements, but somehow the government never delivers. When we look at the area of infrastructure, as with many other areas, the government has tried to spotlight all of this. If we look at it in real terms, there has been a long-term decline in public investment as a proportion of GDP. I am sure the member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) would back that up. I think it can all be summed up by what the Institution of Engineers said in 1993:

       Present level of infrastructure spending is grossly inadequate. Creation of the existing framework has required consistent national investment years of twice the present rate. Failure to make adequate provision for maintenance and repair of that framework, let alone for continuing development and expansion to meet new opportunities. Over a short period of time, this will reduce our international competitiveness.
      </para>
      <para>
       There it is—it puts it very simply in black and white. Yet the government continues to ignore this. What we are really seeing is just a flow of reports. For example, there was the Task Force on Regional Development in 1993. There was the Allen Consulting Group's report to the Automobile Association in 1993 which pointed to massive unfunded road and rail projects of the order of $15 billion to $20 billion and pointed out that the traffic congestion costs of Sydney and Melbourne are $2 billion each year. There was the Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics analysis in 1994 which backed this up. And so the reports go on.

        It is not just the level of funding. What we find is that where there is funding there is massive waste. What better summation of this than the speech by the member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris) when he delivered the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure report in 1993 when he said:

        If we look at country fuel prices, we see clearly that the Labor Party has very little understanding of country areas and, worse still, cares less. The cost of transport, of course, is vital to people in the country because they rely on it every day. As a percentage of total costs for people in the country, transport is always much higher; in fact, often double. The Business Council of Australia put out a report in 1994 which stated that road transport in rural areas was overpriced. It said that road transport in city areas was underpriced. That is very interesting. I think the point is made very clearly once again that Labor ensures that the country subsidises the city.

        The report went on to suggest that rural fuel prices should be 20c per litre lower than now. This would lower costs to people in the country by a staggering $2.1 billion and would obviously have a far greater impact on our rural export competitiveness. High prices not only affect exports but also distort rural-urban investment patterns. These figures make a mockery of the government's regional development policy which is talking about $140 million over four years. The government talks of level playing fields. Maybe it ought to remember that charity begins at home.

        I want to get on to rail freight but, unfortunately, time is going to be a bit limited. The Industry Commission has made many reports. We know that, because we do not have a world best practice rail system, the costs to farmers and the costs to our mining industry are far higher. The Bureau of Industry Economics has made points about this.

As Contship put in its most recent rating of 46 ports, Sydney has dropped from 24th to 31st and Melbourne has dropped from 28th to 37th. What has happened on the waterfront really is a national disgrace.

        —I welcome the chance to debate this motion and the further opportunity it provides to examine the transport policies of the opposition. The motion and the speech by the member for Wannon (Mr Hawker) are based on two propositions, two assumptions: first, that the coalition in government would increase federal expenditure on transport; and, second, that it would lower taxes on fuel. Nothing could be further from the truth.

        Nothing could be further from the truth once one examines the sorts of fiscal policies that are being promoted, for instance, by the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello). The approach of those in the coalition is typical. They are the two-card tricksters of Australian politics because they only show one card at a time, never the two together. For instance, the shadow Treasurer in his budget reply speech at the National Press Club on 17 May showed one card. He declared the coalition's support for the FitzGerald report objective of increasing national savings in Australia by five per cent of GDP. The other card he tried to show that day was the pretension of inoffensive policies: no new taxes, no tax increases and no use of those particular budgetary tools to increase national savings.

        At the press club he also pointed out that privatisation does nothing to improve national savings in Australia. He argued that the privatisation of Telecom, one of the opposition's policies, would do nothing to meet that objective of improved national savings. This is what the shadow Treasurer said at the press club:

       Under these circumstances, the House is entitled to ask: where is the coalition going to find the five per cent lift, the five per cent improvement, in national savings? If it is not coming from new taxes, if it is not going to come from tax increases and if it cannot come from privatisation of assets like Telecom, it leaves a $20 billion hole in the outlays policies of the coalition, because that is the equivalent of five per cent of GDP.

        In terms of the government's record on transport, there is absolutely no two card trickery. This government is full on aces. When we examine the record of tax in fuel, the tax take now in 1995-96 is lower than it was in 1982-83. If the honourable member for Wannon has a complaint about the scale of tax revenue taken by the federal government from fuel, he should be talking to his predecessor, Malcolm Fraser. It was Malcolm Fraser who turned the petrol bowsers of this nation into a tax revenue source. Since 1982-83 government receipts from fuel taxes, minus the diesel rebate, have declined in real terms from $6.4 billion, where they were left by the previous member for Wannon, Malcolm Fraser, in 1982-83, to $5 billion forecast in the 1995-96 budget. Members of the National Party should take their shoes off and get their hands on the table and do their sums. They will find that, once they look at the fuel taxes minus the diesel rebate in Australia, the sum total has declined over the last 12 years and that represents real relief for rural Australia.

        Further, the National Road Transport Commission has calculated that the tax share of vehicle operating costs in Australia is approximately six per cent—there is an effective tax share of six per cent. It is little different to the average tax rate paid by all industries. Here we have competitive neutrality. It is beautiful to see. There is a six per cent effective tax share on vehicle operating costs in Australia. It is little different to the way in which federal taxes are applied to other industries.

        Further, there are two recent reports finding that overall spending on transport is not the central issue; it is the effective targeting of spending that matters most. I refer honourable members opposite to the EPAC report which found that the overall level of transport spending in Australia is satisfactory. It is the effective targeting that is all important. Further, the National Transport Planning Taskforce, in its report in December last year, concluded that there was insufficient evidence—we certainly have not heard it from the honourable member for Wannon today—to support a case for a substantial increase in the current level of overall transport infrastructure spending. Therefore, this high quality report has found that the government has pretty well got it right in terms of overall spending on transport infrastructure around the nation.

I was delighted to hear the member for Wannon outlining to the House his support for the findings of the FitzGerald study on the allocation of road funding. It found—and it has been confirmed by the National Transport Planning Taskforce—that the big efficiency gain, the big improvement in productivity, comes from a transfer in road funding from rural to urban areas, from local to arterial roads. That is understandable because we have moved the economy from an old mining quarry and a reliance on agricultural exports to advanced manufacturing and service industries in urban areas.

He mentioned a lot of reports, but the figures I have, in comparison with his, indicate that the government receives nearly $10 billion in excise and tax from fuel, and this year it is spending a measly $840 million on roads.

        I am from a rural area, and it is about time that rural areas stood up and had their say. I heard the member for Werriwa say that the money should be transferred to the city. Does he not know that two out of every three dollars Australia earns in export income is generated in rural areas? What do we get back for it? If you are talking about mining, farming, fishing, tourism or forestry, most of that money comes from rural areas. We earn this money in rural areas, yet the people in the capital cities—and good luck to them too—have the advantage of cheaper fuel.

        I will give you an example, and this is mainly for the benefit of the member for Werriwa. In my electorate at the moment a feedlot is being built called the Prime City Feedlot. It is about 40 kilometres west of Griffith and both the Carrathool Shire Council and the Griffith City Council are involved. This business is going to have about 60,000 cattle—one of Australia's largest feedlots—and a throughput of 150,000 cattle during any one year. This feedlot will have a dramatic effect on the economy of south-eastern Australia, and not just the Griffith and Goolgowi districts.

I hope that members of Minister Howe's office come back to the Riverina and look at this development.

        In a national context there seems to me, from my short time in this House, to be a glaring example of a lack of a coordinated approach. I do not altogether blame the federal government, although it has had an opportunity in the last 12 years to do a heck of a lot more than it has been able to achieve. There is not sufficient understanding of the relationship between road and rail transport. The National Rail Corporation is endeavouring to bring a stronger and more coordinated approach to rail, but there is no research in this country, to my knowledge, of the relationship between road and rail.

It is worth remembering that with the focus on regional development that will play a key role at the next election the government is proposing to spend about $160 million over the next four years as its contribution to revitalising regional Australia.

        On the matter of the waterfront, one of the great frustrations in my electorate about the ports is the WIRA agreement, the compensation paid for restructuring. People receive handsome payouts of up to $300,000 or $400,000, go out the door on a Friday and then many of them are rehired at casual labour rates that are higher than the rates of pay on which they finished up. That is just one of the things adding to the costs. We are all reliant on export income but those who are directly reliant on it are particularly frustrated when they see what they perceive to be rorts—I was trying to think of a more generous word—like that. There has been some improvement but we are still well behind world best practice on our waterfront. If we want a competitive export industry that will deal with our current account deficit we have to have a far stronger recognition of the transport industry.

       In the 10 minutes I have been allowed in this debate, I do not wish to argue the case for non-deductibility of legal expenses, but I want to argue that the tax deductibility of litigation costs should be referred by the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Banking, Finance and Public Administration for thorough examination.

        In its action plan, the Access to Justice Advisory Committee devoted chapter 8 to tax deductibility of legal costs. The Trade Practices Commission, in its report, found many aberrations in the tax and court systems, because tax deductibility of legal expenses was provided for one litigant in a litigation process while being denied to the other private litigant.

       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        I will summarise some of the points made from those reports, starting with the report of the Trade Practices Commission. Firstly, the report found that tax deductibility may create distortions in the market which, in turn, create a bias in favour of business and a disincentive to compromise disputes prior to litigation. Secondly, tax deductibility may be a factor in excessive demands placed on limited court resources. This pressure on the courts and judges is all too obvious.

      <para first-indent="16">
       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        Thirdly, strong equity considerations point to the need for a review of the current law, in particular the financial imbalance between private litigants and business litigants. Fourthly, the report raised the question of whether tax deductibility should be withdrawn entirely from legal expenses or whether, in cases where the other party cannot claim legal expenses as a deduction, it should similarly be denied to business litigants. This would not deny a business enterprise its right to litigate, but it would even up the field considerably between the two. Finally, the fact that the cost of non-tax deductibility of litigation expenses would fall heaviest on the insurance and banking industry comes as no surprise.

      <para first-indent="16">
       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        Some points made in the report of the Access to Justice Advisory Committee are as follows. Firstly, the test of tax deductibility tends to be more lenient for business than for individuals not conducting business. Secondly, the New South Wales Law Society criticised tax deductibility of legal expenses as creating an incentive for business to litigate rather than use dispute resolution.
       </tab>
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        Thirdly, there is an inequity between business litigants and the individual, because one can rely on tax deductions and the other cannot. The report said that, because of this inequity, the general body of taxpayers—including the private litigant—is subsidising the business litigant's decision to litigate. Finally, the deductibility of the business litigant's legal expenses could accentuate imbalances of bargaining power in the litigation.

        The Access to Justice Advisory Committee concluded in action 8.1 that the government should commission a review of the current law and practice governing the tax deductibility of litigation legal expenses. I am interested in this motion because I am one of only two continuing members of the House of Representatives committee that produced the report on banking and deregulation entitled

        In spite of recommendation 60 of the committee's report calling for independent mediators to overcome what the committee saw were the obvious facts outlined by the Trade Practices Commission and the Access to Justice Advisory Committee, there are many instances where some banks are still pursuing litigation for the purpose of forcing the private litigant into bankruptcy and ensuring their inability to proceed.

        Section 17 of our report investigated specifically foreign currency loans. In rejecting a call for a royal commission—sought by the then Senator McLean and the Foreign Borrowers Association—the committee recommended that the `Westpac letters' be referred to the National Crime Authority. Unfortunately, the referral was not accepted by the National Crime Authority. If it had been accepted perhaps some of the continuing litigation cases would have been already settled more amicably.

        In one of the House of Representatives committee's conclusions—15.89, page 265—the committee regarded as serious the allegations of abuse of process by means of banks' delaying tactics and poor discovery. This led to recommendations Nos 49 and 50 asking that the Australian Law Reform Commission examine this abuse of process and that a Senate committee investigate the cost of justice issue.

        I am concerned that the problems presented by witnesses to our inquiry still continue, as does the abuse of the legal system. As a result there is no equity for the private litigant. That is due partially to the tax deductibility aspect of litigation costs and the fact that private litigants have limited funding and access to justice as compared with the funding power of the banks themselves.

        I was also disappointed in the response of the Assistant Treasurer (Mr Gear) of 9 March to my request to have this matter examined. He repeated what we all know about tax deductibility. But his comment that `the government considers that the current taxation treatment of legal expenses does not disadvantage an individual's access to the legal system' shows that either the government or the Assistant Treasurer—or both—are completely out of touch with the reality as indicated by the Trade Practices Commission and the Access to Justice Advisory Committee.

        Since the committee's inquiry I have had close links with six cases involving foreign currency loans. Four of those cases have been settled—compromised with the banks' insistence that there be no publication or comment by the litigant on the terms of settlement, thus denying other litigants the ability to find out what the courts are thinking. The process of this particular type of abuse is outlined in a letter I received from one of the litigants. I shall refer to the company involved as `X company'. The letter reads:

        The government's power to provide banking licences should exact a condition that the banks adopt a reasonable attitude in regard to the exercise of that licence. It is then the government's responsibility to ensure there is no abuse of that licence if some of the banks are abusing the tax deductibility of legal expenses. I recommend the motion to the parliament for the reference to be referred to a House of Representatives committee.

        I think we need to explain for ordinary Australians just what tax deductibility means, particularly in banking. Take farms, for example. If a bank takes a farmer to court to repossess the farm on the basis of a failed mortgage and,  incidentally, not being compelled to mediate, spends $1 million and that farmer spends $50,000, the bank is entitled to claim $1 million as an expense of business. What this means is that taxpayers are subsidising the litigation. We are subsidising it to the tune of 36c for every dollar.

        In relation to the farming community, I think it is an absolute tragedy that banks are happily foreclosing on farmers without resorting to mediation. In fact, there is only one state in Australia that has introduced legislation to force compulsory bank mediation for farmers—that state is New South Wales. I am pleased to say that the then shadow spokesman for consumer affairs and now Minister for Agriculture, Richard Amery, was at the forefront of that fight.

        Whilst I support this motion to commission an inquiry, I have to say that the big end of town, especially banks and insurance companies, should not be subsidised when hitting the battlers or the little people. In the whole area of banking, we have got a lot of benefits out of deregulation. Whilst I would be the last one to want to turn back the clock, I think we have failed to set up proper protection for consumers. Some members might ask me, `Why has the independent banking ombudsman not intervened in the cases spoken about by the member for Dawson?' Firstly, the independent banking ombudsman is an industry ombudsman paid for by industry. Secondly, small business is precluded from such areas of operation. What we are finding is that a whole raft of people need consumer protection—not just Mr and Mrs Average but also small business and farmers. We have a long way to go.

        Banking is no ordinary private enterprise arrangement. The honourable member for Dawson is not permitted to go out and establish a bank in his electorate or in my electorate. It requires a government licence. Not every company that applies for a licence is entitled to get one. Unlike other businesses, we have the operations of the Reserve Bank, which, even though it does not guarantee deposits, ensures there is no collapse or denigration of depositors' funds. It is almost a fail-safe business—even when businesses haemorrhage, as the banks did in the eighties with their corporate lending policies.

I hope that the motion moved by the honourable member for Dawson will attract the support of both sides of the House—and in its proposition and seconding, it does—and that we will see such a reference.

        —There are many horror stories involving banks and small investors. I submit this one to the House because of the wider problems it illustrates. Dick and Robyn Van Rheeden were a retired couple living on the northern beaches of Sydney. In the late 1980s they signed a contract to buy home units on the Gold Coast. After the 1987 stock market crash, they were going to let the contracts lapse and forfeit their deposit but, after a visit from their local Westpac manager, they felt reassured that the value of the units and the value of the family home meant that they could go ahead and complete the transaction. So they borrowed a very large sum of money from Westpac.

        As it happened, the property market crashed, the units did not sell, interest mounted higher and higher, and eventually Westpac sold the Van Rheedens' home to cover their debts. The Van Rheedens claim that they had gone into this purchase only on Westpac's advice that they could afford it. Essentially, the subsequent legal case turned on who was to be believed—the Van Rheedens, who claimed that Westpac's representatives were responsible for their loss, or the Westpac manager, who claimed that he had made no formal representations about the value of the Van Rheedens' assets. As it happened, the trial judge believed the bank manager and not the Van Rheedens, probably because he found that Mrs Van Rheeden was in a highly emotional condition and had taken a set against the bank.

        From being comfortably well off, the Van Rheedens had been reduced to living out of suitcases and in rented houses.

        There are three issues here. The first is the tendency of judges to believe professionals rather than lay people. No doubt, when compared to Westpac's manager, the Van Rheedens were highly emotional, almost distraught, witnesses. Let us face it: Westpac's manager was going to get paid regardless of the outcome of the case whereas the Van Rheedens stood to lose their whole life savings. Right now we are understandably anxious to eliminate gender bias in the law, but the solidarity of judges for other professionals may be just as insidious in denying justice to deserving individuals.

       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        The second problem, at least on the evidence I have seen, is Westpac's failure to disclose its relationship with AGC, which was financing the home units which the Van Rheedens were trying to buy. Westpac, in other words, had a double interest in the Van Rheedens' purchase: first, the interest income that Westpac would earn on the money borrowed; and, second, the profit AGC would earn—or more likely the losses AGC would avoid—if these units sold. The law should require institutions to disclose to their clients their additional financial interests in their clients' affairs.

       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        The third problem is the gross disparity in legal firepower between Westpac and the Van Rheedens, who are now my constituents. Pitting the Van Rheedens against Westpac is like Australia playing against Western Samoa. Sure, they play under the same rules and the referee might be fair, but even under those circumstances Australia starts 30 points in front. However, in this case the opponents are not playing under the same rules; and the rules are not fair because if Westpac spends $100,000 defending a legal case, that $100,000 is entirely tax deductible. If a private citizen spends $100,000 taking a legal case, every last cent comes out of after tax dollars.

        Australia argues, quite rightly, for a level playing field for overseas trade. What the Australian government demands of other countries it should grant to its own citizens. Public companies in particular should not have an institutional advantage over their legal opponents. There are many things that could be done to fix this problem. Contingency fees is one; changing the litigation happy atmosphere, where some people are more interested in fees than justice, is another. We should certainly reconsider the tax deductibility status of companies' legal expenses. I am happy to commend this motion to the House.

        There are some difficulties with the proposition but the suggested mechanism of referring the matter to the Standing Committee on Finance and Public Administration is sensible because this issue needs to be examined very closely. We have to recognise that there are plenty of legitimate circumstances in which it would be quite appropriate for a business involved in litigation, including litigation against an individual rather than another corporate entity, to be able to deduct the cost of that litigation.

        There are plenty of examples of tax deductibility for legal expenses being quite legitimate and no speakers in this debate would disagree with them. However, there is no doubt that the points that have been raised by all speakers in this debate are valid. We do have a problem. How to tackle that problem is the real question. The problem ultimately comes from an inequality in economic power. This means that if a company is very large and is able to bear the cost of litigation, and is also able to deduct the cost from its taxation, it has an enormous advantage over people such as the constituents the honourable member for Warringah (Mr Abbott) has cited.

        In my practice as a lawyer I encountered this type of situation very commonly, particularly with groups such as insurance companies. One of the classic examples is total and permanent disability benefit claims under superannuation trust deeds—I have mentioned this here before—where the person whose claim has been denied by the insurer has the choice of accepting the result or risking thousands of dollars pursuing a Supreme Court case with maybe a fifty-fifty chance of success. They know that the costs to them if they fail will be enormous and they could lose their house, yet the costs to the insurance company will be written off as a tax deduction. Those are the sorts of problems people face.

Such things as increasing access to community legal centres and better legal aid—and broadening it beyond the heavy focus on criminal legal aid—are very significant steps forward in tilting the balance of power back a little in favour of small people so that the huge imbalance they tend to face against organisations such as banks and insurance companies is redressed a bit.

There is a range of issues that slowly, bit by bit, both the federal government and most of the states are starting to tackle. I was pleased to see that the former New South Wales Liberal government under Premier John Fahey took the lead on the issue of the abolition of QCs. I commend it for that.

        The final point I will make is that the real problem in all of this is not so much the economic power issue. That is a separate issue. It is not the legal system that creates that; the system just reflects it. Economic inequality is a broader issue than that. The real problem is excessive litigation and the fact that tax deductibility tends to create an incentive, particularly for larger corporations, to go all the way in litigation and to avoid mediation by simply saying, `No, we are not interested in talking; we are not interested in settling; we are not interested in resolving sensibly. We are going to fight you all the way to the High Court if you can find the $100,000 to finance your case.' The real problem is that what our system currently does is to encourage excessive litigation so that we have more lawyers in Australia than in the whole of Japan, which of course has about six times our population. We need to look at this issue from both of those angles.

        I was disappointed that the honourable member for Chifley (Mr Price) took the opportunity to bash just about everybody involved in this issue. He expressed some very serious reservations about and cast aspersions on the banking ombudsman because she is industry funded. He probably overlooked the fact that the banking ombudsman has actually done a very good job of solving a lot of the complaints that people have had. If he were to read the ombudsman's annual report carefully he would see that many of these disputes are now being settled to the full satisfaction of both the banks and their customers. So the ombudsman, I believe, needs to be given a pat on the back, rather than a kick in the backside, and encouraged to keep going.

        Bank bashing—and there was an element of that in some of the contributions, and my friend the member for Chifley fell into that trap—is a bit like motherhood. It is easy to get up here and bash the banks—and my own close colleague the member for Warringah (Mr Abbott) did not actually pull too many punches either. The fact is that most of the banks—and perhaps all the banks—have very good relations with most of their customers most of the time. The sorts of circumstances that my colleague the member for Warringah referred to, and the sorts of matters that are brought before the House of Representatives Banking, Finance and Public Administration Committee, of which I am a fairly recent member—and I respect the longstanding service of the member for Dawson (Mr Braithwaite) on that committee—are, ultimately, very few compared to the number of banking transactions that go on from day to day.

        Therefore, I do not want necessarily to take the more difficult path of defending the banks, because in many respects they have a lot to answer for. I do not think there is any doubt about that. But by and large we should recognise that most banks have good relations with their customers. They realise it is a competitive industry. They realise they will survive only if they do the right thing by their customers. That was one of the aims and objectives of deregulation, which the government, to its credit, brought about. There are elements of that that have not worked, but nobody here—certainly the member for Chifley made the point—is arguing for reregulation.

        I wonder where the member for Chifley and others who go down that track want to stop. They may not be arguing for reregulation of the banking industry, but they are certainly arguing for a degree of intervention in customer relations that I think raises some serious question marks. The member for Chifley, for instance, makes the point—and he is  technically correct—that there is a sense in which the taxpayers at large are subsidising this tax deductibility.

        But if you want to take a very small technical point, that is the case with all tax deductibility.

If that means taking legal action, a business is perfectly at liberty to do so.

        I certainly take the point of the honourable member for Chifley, that the banks are very privileged in that they are given a licence to operate—and the honourable member for Chifley asked some good questions about whether those licensing arrangements are, per se, adequate. In other words, as with television licences, such is the public interest involved that they perhaps ought to be subject to some review.

        As a percentage of that waste stream, packaging has been variously cited as being as low as 30 per cent to as high as 60 per cent. Therefore, even if one projects the lowest figure that has been cited—30 per cent—we can see that it is still a significant part of the waste stream which goes through our society. Ours has been a society of growing waste. One needs to look at all industrial countries to be able to identify that situation.

        The burden of that waste stream is borne by local government authorities to a very great extent. That situation does vary from state to state, but a generalisation can be made that the local government authorities are the ones who bear that major burden. That comes through domestic waste from their local areas, such as from town tips. It is also caused where areas are adjacent to or in close proximity to major metropolitan areas such as Sydney.

        In the instance of Sydney, we find that the last state government was involved in the process of organising mega-tips around the Sydney metropolitan area, the idea being that waste translocation facilities would be organised within various local government authorities throughout the urban area. They would then transport their waste by contract out to areas beyond the city's limits. Therefore, those areas are the final landfill repositories. The problems that that has created over the last 50 years in terms of engineering and the cost to the environment have been outrageous. It was always thought that, if it was low and if it was wet, you would fill it. The number of species in the wetland areas which have been demolished because of this process has been quite outrageous.

        Whilst local government has taken on the burden, the costs to it are far beyond the point of sale. In other words, the marketplace itself is not responsive to those costs which are related to the product. Therefore, something needs to be done to put this all into one confine so that we can actually have an influence on the types and quantities of packaging. I will give an example of package waste. I have two young sons who like ice blocks. If you buy those ice blocks in a traditional supermarket, there are four levels of packaging before you actually get to the good.

        A negative relationship needs to be established with the quantity of packaging; indeed, we need to increase the quality of packaging. To do that, we need to have some economic incentive, or disincentive. In this case, I would consider a packaging tax as the most appropriate regime. A tax on packaging can be levied at the point of manufacture. This would put economic reality back to a place in the waste stream where it can actually have some effect.

I think there ought to be a strong impetus for those people to restrict the amount of packaging and the types of materials that they put forward. If they did not do that and the cost of packaging was passed on to the consumers, I believe that at least an income stream to handle that material would be generated so that those who have the burden—local government—would be able to access that income stream to provide environmentally friendly solutions.

If it is sourced in native forests or old-growth forests, obviously it will have a higher negative impact than if it was sourced from waste out of a pine forest.

        —The honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Knott) may be correct in his claim that the major burden for waste management is borne by local government authorities, but it is appropriate to acknowledge the fact that in the 1980s many of these same local government authorities acted to effectively treble the amount of domestic waste directed to landfill when they decided to adopt the 240-litre mobile garbage bin system. They were warned at the time of the problems the MGB system would create, but they chose to ignore the warning.

        Unfortunately, he scores nought out of 100 for his next statement, which forms the basis of and justification for this ill-conceived packaging tax proposal. His assertion that a major source of the waste stream is derived from packaging is demonstrably incorrect. Packaging is not a major source of the waste stream. In fact, it constitutes only about 10 per cent of the urban solid waste stream. Garden refuse, industrial waste, builders' rubble and other organic and food wastes are all significantly larger components.

        Why, therefore, is the honourable member targeting packaging? Why is he suggesting a packaging tax instead of a garden refuse tax, a building rubble tax or a food waste tax? Perhaps it is because, like so many other people, he simply does not understand very much about the packaging industry, how it operates and the reason why it exists. Perhaps it is because packaging not only has the disadvantage of being very visible but also inevitably ends its life as a discard. It is therefore a very easy target to attack—albeit wrongly—as being unnecessary or wasteful.

        Whilst it may be correct that generally packaging does not enjoy a favourable reputation, it is certainly true that this unfavourable status is undeserved. In many instances, packaging saves more waste than it creates. The basic functions of packaging are to contain, preserve, protect and provide information. Without packaging, materials handling would be difficult, inefficient and uneconomic, but this does not mean the packaging industry does not have an environmental conscience; in fact, the Australian packaging industry has a long history of environmental responsibility and achievements.

        It is hardly surprising that the reduction of packaging at source has been a major priority of the Australian packaging industry. It makes good sense for packaging companies to seek to minimise packaging. Less packaging means reduced production costs. Reduced production costs mean lower product prices.

        The local food packaging industry is a good example. Packaging material suppliers, packaging manufacturers and filling equipment suppliers have worked in close cooperation to achieve significant reductions such as decreasing the weight of containers by reducing wall thicknesses; wherever possible and appropriate substituting lighter packaging materials for heavier alternatives; using composite packages that require less material overall; taking advantage of computer aided design systems to redesign packages and container profiles; producing larger unit sizes to reduce package to produce ratios; and producing products in concentrated form. In Australia, over the past 20 years, these industry initiatives in source reduction have resulted in significant decreases in the overall usage of a wide range of packaging materials.

        It would be different if the industry was actively working to increase the amount and weight of packaging, but the reverse is the case. How about a little reward for effort—some acknowledgment of, and praise for, the results so far achieved. Amongst the factors the member for Gilmore suggests should be taken into account in assessing his proposed unreasonable, illogical and unwarranted impost on the packaging industry is whether or not the different materials used in packaging can be recycled or reused. He also suggested a packaging tax would discourage the quantity of packaging used on individual products.

        The packaging industry already has an excellent record on reuse and recycling. It was actively recycling long before the environment became a popular issue and it is certainly not content to rest on its laurels. It is significant that the impressive results attained so far—superior to virtually all other industries—have been achieved on a voluntary basis. In regard to discouraging the quantity of packaging used on individual products, it is not all that simple. Apart from the examples I have already quoted, which clearly demonstrate the packaging industry's commitment in this regard, it should be remembered that there are minimums that must be applied.

        Adequate and appropriate packaging is essential to protect the quality and nutrition of food from damage and contamination and to prevent or minimise spoilage. There is a very real danger that food safety and public health may be jeopardised by ill-conceived regulatory measures aimed at controlling or reducing packaging waste, such as the proposal we are debating today. It is vital that policies aimed at minimising the possible environmental impact of food packaging, however apparently worthy in their appeal, should in no way compromise the degree—the very high degree—of food safety, quality and nutrition presently enjoyed by the Australian consumer.

        In any event, it is a fact that the packaging of food products not only reduces spoilage but also reduces the amount of waste going to landfill. Overseas studies have shown that cities in countries using a high level of food packaging have considerably less waste entering landfill than cities in countries with limited access to packaged food. Without the benefit of packaging to preserve food, a higher proportion of spoilage occurs and, therefore, a greater amount of waste is consigned to the garbage collection for landfill disposal.

        It seems somewhat incongruous for the honourable member for Gilmore to feel that by imposing further taxes—and heaven knows we have enough of those already—we will solve a problem that industry is already actively and very successfully confronting. If he wants to tax someone—and the Labor Party is very good at doing that—then why single out the packaging industry? If local government authorities are bearing a major part of the burden of the cost of waste management, I ask: why do they not start charging on a user-pays basis for their garbage collection services? The more you tip, the more you pay. That would be much fairer. At least it might make people think before they throw. It might encourage more home composting, more active domestic recycling, more careful thought about the fact that our society is using natural resources at an unsustainable rate and creating more waste than can be disposed of without environmental damage.

        The Australian packaging industry has a sound environmental record, one that has been achieved by working cooperatively and constructively with governments whilst at the same time devoting considerable resources to educational and community programs which have an environmental focus. The industry has a record of commitment to recycling and waste management which is superior in quality and duration to that of most other countries. The success of the packaging industry in meeting its recycling commitments and delivering responsible environmental outcomes indicates that a voluntary, cooperative and constructive approach—not legislation, and certainly not more taxes—is the best way forward. At the risk of adding to the existing landfill problem, I suggest that the honourable member's motion be consigned straight to the tip; it does not even deserve to be recycled.

        There have been some achievements overall in the environmental considerations and movements towards reduction of waste across the different sections of industry as a whole. The whole movement towards that certainly gained a big impetus several years ago and led very quickly to the recognition that we in Australia do not have industries geared up and in place to handle the amount of material that can be recycled. That became a bit of an embarrassment in different places where material was simply stockpiled because there was not a market for it. If I have time, I will come back to the issue of the creation of markets for recyclable material, to ensure that the amount that is recycled is increased and that people's efforts at being part of the recycling process are duly rewarded with that knowledge.

This afternoon the member for Gilmore has brought to the House a recognition that some areas of the industry need a bit of a push along. At the same time, we recognise that the best way is not just a stick but certainly a carrot as well—that is, some incentives for the industry to move at its own pace.

However, one only has to go into a supermarket or anywhere else—I talk about not just food but also other packaging material in different types of shops and retail outlets—to know that there is still a considerable amount of useless and superfluous packaging going into the products we buy. When you go into a supermarket and buy items of food, for instance—that is what the member for Casey was so concerned about; he seemed to use the emotive part of his argument to downgrade the motion of the member for Gilmore—you find that it is not unusual for there to be three or four containers encompassing the article you wish to buy. There will be a sterile and sealed container of quite strong security, due to the new technology that is able to be used. There will be one, two or three different cardboard packages surrounded by another plastic or cellophane type product which seals the whole lot up.

We have to maximise the free labour that is used by Australian families all around this wonderful country in sorting things.

        Recycling is improving all the time in the steel industry. The overall recycling rate of steel is 70 per cent. Seventy per cent of all steel is recycled. Unfortunately, in municipal scrap—and this is where that free labour for sorting comes in—cans and small steel items are only being recycled at the rate of two to three per cent. The target is to get that up to 25 per cent. We are hopeful that, with the cooperation of the mums and dads of Australia, this can be achieved because steel is easy to separate, by magnetic means, from other garbage. This is going to be one area where we can make some definite progress.

        In fairness to the packaging industry, it has got to be realised that they are not foolish people; they are doing the best that is available right now. Nobody in their right mind who is a manufacturer or a user of packaging is going to use more than they need. The member for Richmond (Mr Newell) made some reference to sealed and sterile containers on the outside and then other containers on the inside. Does he really want to get food that can be contaminated in an unsealed and unsterile form of packaging? I find that absolutely amazing. The reality is that, if you look at the situation with a fair and open mind, it is packaging that has allowed the growth of civilisation.

        —The member for Moreton may laugh. Has he forgotten whooping cough and all sorts of other diseases that are still prominent in some parts of Australia that you and I are concerned about with our Aboriginal Australians? Packaging is at the forefront of civilisation. If you want to go back to having your live fish in the basin alongside and then cutting it to get it fresh, by all means. Without packaging we would not have the distribution of food and other products that are so important to our economy. My friends the member for Moreton and the member for Capricornia (Ms Henzell) may smile, but they cannot deny that. We have got to protect our foods from gases and fumes, from heat and cold, from desiccation, from vermin and from contaminants.

For that I applaud the energy of the member for Gilmore.

For all the benefits that the opposition has mentioned there are costs, even though I agree packaging is only one factor of environmental issues in relation to recycling and the use of waste. It has been assessed that environmental benefits of recycling are the following: reduction of energy use, 23 to 74 per cent; reduction of air pollution, 74 per cent; reduction of water pollution, 35 per cent; and, reduction of water use, 58 per cent.

        In the short time available, I want to pay tribute to the Rockhampton City Council for its recycling endeavours. It received an award from Ian Kiernan, the founder of Clean Up Australia Day, on 16 June 1994. Mr Kiernan stated that Rockhampton's recovery rates were the highest in the country. Recycling had reduced landfill levels at the council tip by 73 per cent in two years, which was over and above the national targets. I believe it indicates what can be done if local councils involve the community through education.

        The one point on which I disagree with the member for Gilmore (Mr Knott) is his call for a packaging tax. I share with other members on this side of the House my concern for another tax regime. I want to reinforce that fact by using the words of the member for Richmond (Mr Newell) who, in addressing this debate, called on legislation to be a carrot and not a stick in order to encourage better packaging management in this nation. I entirely agree. The whole secret of success in South Australia—I say this for the information of the member for Gilmore—has been that the legislation has effectively been a carrot and not a stick.

        What exists in container recycling incentives in South Australia is not a tax but the opportunity to get a refund for having returned that particular container to a recycling pool. That is the direction we should take and the direction I would encourage the member for Gilmore to take in this whole area of how we develop greater recycling. The member for Cowper (Mr Nehl) and the member for Casey (Mr Halverson) have already made the point that as a general rule we use less packaging than we used to. The market dictates that that packaging level ought to fall.

        I heard with interest the member for Gilmore when he said that he had purchased iceblocks for his sons and had been concerned that in that iceblock process there were four forms of packaging. He did not have an opportunity, because time would not allow him, to elaborate. I was a little mystified because I could not quite see how you could avoid the stick which held up the iceblock. That may not have been what he was wanting to avoid. I was counting that as one. He was saying it was not, but I was trying to draw an analogy. I also felt, as everyone else would agree, that there was a need to have a wrapping around the iceblock for the sake of hygiene and that the iceblock was bound to come in some form of carton or container. So I was running out of areas in which I could prune the packaging concern that he had raised.

        In the industries with which I am most familiar, packaging has been reduced over the last decade. I frequently stand here as the representative of the Barossa Valley in defence of the wine industry. It is of interest to me that the wine industry, in trying to minimise its packaging load, has got to the point at which wine is now not simply put in casks, which themselves minimise packaging relative to bottles, but placed in entire shipping containers that are plastic-lined. So they are shipped to their destination as a wine in the container plastic-lined. The plastic-lined container, the balloon if you like, that keeps the wine in that shipping container, is itself then sent back folded to Australia for cleaning and recycling—I would have thought the sort of move that ought to be encouraged.

        Finally, since like the member for Gilmore I am running out of time, my particular concern about this legislation firstly was the level of tax. I would prefer some form of incentive. My other concern is that the focus of the debate has been on what local government ought to be doing. I agree that this should be an entirely local government initiative but, as such, I would have thought it behoves all of us to be encouraging our state colleagues to introduce some form of legislation at the state level. In South Australia, the state legislation introduced by a Labor government and policed subsequently by a Liberal government has been very successful. This is very much a state and not a Commonwealth initiative. Local government is very much a creature of the states and, as such, this direction that the member for Gilmore rightly wants to steer local government in ought to come as an impetus from state rather than from federal authorities.

        —In speaking to the motion of the member for Gilmore (Mr Knott), I would like to firstly respond to a number of the points that opposition members have made in their speeches on this motion and, in particular, in their opposition to the question of a tax. It is a fairly predictable reaction by the opposition to say, `No, we can't have a tax, we are already overtaxed,' et cetera. But what has to be understood is that in dealing with waste management issues, in dealing with the waste stream that we have in our community, ultimately the consumers will always pay one way or another. If we do not reduce the level of waste, if we do not reduce the level of packaging that we have, we then have to find bigger and more dumps to get rid of rubbish and the councils pay. The councils charge extra rates to their ratepayers to deal with their waste management strategies, and our environment suffers. We then have to spend a lot more federal, state and local government taxes dealing with major environmental problems because we are still chopping down too many trees for production into cardboard and paper for packaging and we have to dig huge holes in the ground to bury our waste, polluting our environment.

        One way or another consumers pay. What the member for Gilmore has suggested in his motion is a means of providing some disincentive to companies to use more and more packaging. He is saying to those companies, `If you are going to use bigger and better packaging all the time which the community ultimately has to dispose of you will pay for it. Your product will be more expensive because there will be a tax on it.' That acts as a means of convincing companies and consumers that it is not in their best interests to have that packaging. If we do not put the tax on that product, the tax will be multiplied 10 times over down the stream when councils have to impose greater rates on their ratepayers to deal with waste.

        Like the member for Capricornia (Ms Henzell), who rightly proudly sang the praises of her local government authority, and the member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew), who talked about the work in South Australia, I would like to praise the work of the Brisbane City Council. The Brisbane City Council, as the largest local government authority in Australia, has committed itself to a program of reducing Brisbane's landfill by 50 per cent by the year 2000. Three years into that program, it is already well on target to achieving that. It has done that with one of the most comprehensive kerb side recycling programs and a number of other measures designed to reduce the waste stream, and it should be applauded.

        What the Brisbane City Council needs is the support of federal and state governments in initiatives like this which are designed to physically reduce the waste stream so that, instead of having to deal with the massive amounts of packaging that consumers purchase, there is a reduction in the level of packaging from the supermarket to the home. Therefore, when it comes to the council's responsibilities, it has much less to deal with. It is in everybody's interest that we positively deal with this issue. It is very much up to all levels of government to address it strongly.

        —The member for Gilmore (Mr Knott) is to be congratulated for bringing this motion before the House. One of the world's major problems is the disposal of waste—nuclear waste, toxic waste, plain garbage and even space junk. Disposable packaging is a substantial part of that problem. It has increased exponentially since the 1950s. It is no accident that, in the recently published list of Australia's richest men, the second richest made his fortune largely out of packaging.

        Since the 1950s, several things have happened. Firstly, the world population has dramatically increased. Secondly, even this rate of growth has been exceeded by the increase in the amount of disposable material being produced. As a result, more and more available public funds are being used for garbage. Most urban councils are now spending about 25 per cent of rates on cleaning, litter and garbage, thus reducing the funds available for many other public needs. Thirdly, the waste we produce is a lot more toxic, non-biodegradable and potentially threatening. Fourthly, the traditional method of disposal by landfill is becoming more difficult and expensive.

        We have tried to solve the problem by getting bigger garbage tins and tips. Yet cities have become dirtier and, like urban traffic, the volume of garbage simply expands to fill the space available. There is no solution until the heart of the problem is tackled. The volume of waste and associated problems will continue to increase until two basic issues are addressed: firstly, the attitude by individuals that there is a `right' to dispose of private rubbish in public places wherever they go at no cost to themselves; and, secondly, the need for a restraint on the production of waste itself and the sheeting home to the producers of waste the full costs of its disposal.

        These fundamental facts have been obvious for many years, yet public policy and regulatory bodies have continued to be largely apologists for the packaging industry. Massive public subsidies have been maintained and even expanded to ensure the transfer of private costs to the taxpayer. The waste management industry is reported to be now worth some $280 billion per annum; hence the powerful incentive to ensure that the production of waste is not reduced. The industry will continue to argue that any restraint on the production of waste will reduce employment, just as the tobacco, armaments or drug producers do. The manufacturers of the gas chambers in 1941 even pointed out the quality of the construction and the industrial employment they were creating.

        The industry has always sought to avoid responsibility and continued to create unsustainable mountains of rubbish. Initially they spent millions on the pernicious `Do the right thing' campaign. The idea was to promote a throwaway society by the production of endless disposables, encouraging people to assume the right to drop rubbish wherever they went at no cost to themselves and, more importantly, at no cost to the manufacturer.

        The theory is now discredited in terms of energy, consumption, the use of natural resources, pollution and the fact that the world is running out of disposal sites. So hey presto! Recycling is now motherhood, along with feelgood Clean Up Australia campaigns. These programs and others promoted by industry front organisations simply deal with symptoms and, to the extent that they are successful, simply facilitate the production of more subsidised waste—anything to avoid policies of reuse, minimising disposables, reduced consumption or making the creators of waste pay.

        Political and bureaucratic conventional wisdom will promote recycling, thereby ensuring waste creation and consumption continues unabated. Good citizen certificates will be awarded on one side and blame the victim programs on the other. Attempts will be made to shame the public and the recycling police will probably soon be examining your garbage. While ever society continually produces ever-increasing quantities of disposable, non-biodegradable materials without any form of restraint, no real solution is possible.

       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        The only long-term solution to achieve a reduction in disposable waste is to remove subsidies and introduce charges, not taxes, on packaging and deposit legislation on bottles and cans. These systems are gradually being adopted in an increasing number of countries faced with the same problem. Any charges should be based on both the volume and biodegradability of the materials used and will result in a dramatic redesign of a great deal of excessive packaging. The charge would defray part of the public cost of disposal and would have a much greater benefit of reducing the total volume of disposable materials.

         —The federal government is going to spend $100 million on an advertising campaign abroad promoting Australia as a tourist destination.

         I am particularly pleased that the focus of this advertising campaign is going to be Manly beach, of which it was truly said, `Seven miles from Sydney and 1,000 miles from care.' But, if Manly beach is good enough to promote, it is good enough to bring up to international standard. Manly council estimates that Manly beach needs $7 million spent to restore the seawall. Until this money is found and spent, promoting Manly in this way is a little bit like inviting people into a most beautiful but half-finished home.

         It is all very well inviting overseas tourists to come to Manly, but how exactly are they going to get there? Most visitors to Manly come by car. Without major transport infrastructure spending, inviting them to Manly is not so much inviting them to a beautiful beach but inviting them into an absolutely massive traffic jam. Today the government also announced that $53 million will be made available for coastal protection. The greatest thing that the government could do for coastal protection would be to announce now that there will be no further development on North Head and Middle Head. That would not cost the taxpayer one single cent.

         According to current indications, an Australian who owns an analog mobile phone will not be able to use it in four years time. Although the Minister for Communications and the Arts (Mr Lee) is to conduct a public inquiry into the proposed phase-out in the 1995-96 fiscal year, he has repeatedly said that, due to contractual obligations with Optus and Vodaphone, the 1 January 2000 phase-out date is not negotiable.

         However, despite the minister's comments, I have received advice that it would be legally possible for the Commonwealth government to extend the provision of analog mobile phone services beyond the year 2000 if an agreement can be made between the government and the carriers. The stance by the minister once again shows the arrogance of this government and how out of touch it is with the wishes of the people of Australia.

         This week I contacted a number of mobile phone retailers and was told that analog mobile phones continually outstrip digital phones in the sales stakes. In fact, there are currently an estimated 1.6 million analog phone users compared with 144,000 digital owners throughout the country. It is my understanding that the government has no plans for the spectrum currently used by the analog system and, as such, there seems no practical reason why an extension beyond the year 2000 is not possible. Unless the government extends the phase-out period, millions of analog phone owners will be disadvantaged.

         Recent events in Wills reveal just how backward the state ALP is. Only recently a disaffected Labor member dropped into my office a 1986 newspaper article in which Kelvin Thomson eulogised work for the dole programs. Would you believe it! Then, rather than condemn such policies, the local ALP, through member and former Coburg councillor, Pauline Taylor, told us, `Most people support unemployed people making a contribution to the community in return for the unemployment benefits they receive.' It sounds like the member for Lilley (Mr Swan) almost, does it not? It makes the description by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) of the coalition as `a party which would knock unemployed people off the dole after nine months' nothing short of hypocritical.

        This has happened because of Jeffrey Kennett.

Thirty per cent of all that emergency relief was given to people to pay their electricity bills. This is what Jeffrey Kennett is doing in Victoria. All Liberal Victorian members should be outraged at what is going on.

I understand action is being taken through the court system at present to recover that money.

         Ray Willing, the previous chief executive of the NRMA, resigned after this fiasco became apparent. Don Mackay and those directors of the NRMA who supported, promoted and defended that fiasco should resign as well. I look forward to seeing them indicating that they have some understanding of the nature of corporate propriety in Australia by resigning before the members take the opportunity to vote them out of office next time.

As Mr Colebatch politely put it, this failure to reconcile is the key point about the opposition. There is no reconciliation between reality and the opposition's phobias. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition may well ask me what the answer is in relation to the current account deficit and the national debt, but one thing is for sure and that is that, whatever the answer is, he has not got a clue.

         I suppose there is always, every now and again, a little marker which marks out where the ground is in Australian public life. If there cannot be a marker on the importance of Japan to Australia and the fact that Australia is an island continent that trades into the Asia Pacific and is not a natural part of any trading bloc and is not looked after, as are countries in Europe or North America by the size and nature of their markets, I would have thought that the opposition would at least have the commonsense to know that something important here is being said in this declaration. Even if the opposition does not know or does not agree, let me underline to the Australian people how important it has been and is to Australia to build this relationship.

I think even members opposite would understand that without the strategic protection which the United States provides to Japan the strategic environment in North Asia would be nothing like as peaceful, passive or certain as it is today. Were that to change, the whole nature of the East Asian region would change; hence, the importance for Japan of resolving these trade differences with the United States so that in the eyes of the American people the standing of Japan does not diminish or suffer.

         I said a few moments ago that on superannuation alone the government's changes are worth about two per cent of GDP by the year 2000 and four per cent by the year 2020. But by the budget coming from a deficit of $12-odd billion back into surplus, rising to a surplus of $7 billion in the next couple of years, there is a very important change of somewhere between two per cent and four per cent of GDP from the budget—depending on whether one wants to disaggregate the cyclical and structural components of it. So there is two per cent to four per cent in the budget and two per cent on superannuation—somewhere between four per cent and six per cent to deal with a two percentage point problem.

         I would have thought that the ANZ bank would have thought that a large change involving every member of the work force putting away 15 per cent as savings was something that was notable and worth supporting, rather than arguing about what the intermediation of the household dollar is; whether it goes to banks or to superannuation accounts. I would have thought that the chief executive of the ANZ bank would have been bigger than that to have got across that point, but apparently not. I make the general point that the government has a two to six percentage point change in for a two percentage point problem. I think that is the core of the matter.

         He asked that the government outline its health agenda. We are clearly doing that, and we will continue to do so. We want to show a very strong commitment to universal health care. As we have shown in the budget, we also have major funding initiatives at a difficult time for a major spending portfolio. In Aboriginal health there is an additional $103 million, which I think has been welcomed by the opposition, and certainly by the AMA. In preventive health measures there is an additional $85 million. A lot of that is going to anti-smoking initiatives and to the immunisation program. Again, I imagine that is welcomed by the opposition spokesperson. In the research area there is an additional $58 million, and in mental health some $13 million in particular initiatives for youth suicide.

I must say that is in stark contrast to the lack of an agenda from the opposition. We still do not have a policy on health from the opposition. There have been various attempts to do it, but they have not succeeded. The opposition leader says that is because the policy is a secret since otherwise we would pinch it. I want to put paid to that. I have heard some signs of what the opposition is proposing, and I can assure it and the Australian people that we would not want to pinch it.

         Your opposition spokesperson on health wants to go back to ninth century Arabia, it would seem. He says that that was the best health system ever devised. In case members are not certain about this, I would like to quote him directly. On 6PR on 22 May, the opposition spokesperson said:

        He perhaps failed to mention that they probably not only were not paid but also lost their heads. I am not sure the AMA would endorse that policy either. I would like to quote him again to very clearly indicate the opposition's stand on this issue.

         So now you are running around trying to say that their estimates are wrong. The government stands by the Treasury's estimates. In broadening the base of the wholesale sales tax the government is reducing existing disparities, providing consistent treatment of goods used in the finishing of houses, basically hardware, and reducing some existing disparities in the wholesale sales tax treatment of certain goods. So, if the only argument here is basically the revenue assumptions, then I rely upon the Treasury and the tax office's basis for those collations, as we have in the past, and on these revenue estimates. They have with these new measures been able to pass as, by and large, accurate.

        This is the tenor of the government's pension reform package. It is a major structural change. It reduces the complex system of the assessment of financial assets of various kinds—shares, managed investments, debentures, friendly society bonds et cetera—currently covered by a complex plethora of rules which, in many cases, treat people differently depending on where they bought their investment. That is replaced by a simple, straightforward system, the central features of which can be described in half a page. That is a vast improvement and simplification that has been broadly welcomed, including by the electorate of Richmond, where, as I said, I had the pleasure of addressing retirement groups. They were overwhelmingly positive in their response to the changes we have made.

         The question from the Leader of the Opposition implies: what is wrong with that? These are the sorts of industrial relations policies he would be following—general piece, low levels of industrial activity, two to three percentage points of inflation, after he left the nation at 11. This sort of change—a high productivity culture, a reduction in disputation of two-thirds over the period when he was last in office—he would return Australia to for the sorts of industrial relations policies he supports in the imputation of this question.

         Let the employers of this country understand that under a coalition government this is what they would see every day of the week. This is the sort of industrial disharmony they would see night and day across the industrial face of this country. As if the profit share and the economy, now knowing no historic precedent, are not high enough, as if they want the wage share to go lower so that the profit share may go higher beyond any historic precedent—as if that is not enough—one of the two or three things the Leader of the Opposition has championed in his whole political life is to hop into the wages of the low paid, hop into the wages of people under about $30,000 a year. What a noble political objective that is—to say, `There I was. I was in parliament for 25 years and I made sure I gave them an upper cut every chance I had, a body blow to the ordinary working people of this country.'

I cannot understand why he holds them in such contempt, why he wants to basically cut their wages and cut their benefits, while at the same time he walks around talking piously and hypocritically about families when he is actually about ripping into them every chance he gets.

We have had the largest fall in 12 months on record and we have had the creation of 4 1/2 per cent of employment growth over the last year.

        We in the United States are proud of our record of creating jobs, but not of the continuing decline in median wages. While we now lead advanced nations in growth and productivity gains, and have lowered inflation, the average hourly compensation of American workers trails 10 foreign economies . . . this average masks a more disturbing reality. While inequality is growing in every advanced economy, the distribution of income and wealth in the United States has become the most unequal of all . . . Last year, with the recovery in full bloom, productivity surpassing 2 per cent, corporate profits up 12 per cent, and economic growth exceeding 4 per cent, the median wages and benefits of Americans continued to decline.

         —Let me conclude on this point. The Leader of the Opposition wants to go round supporting policies that have been rejected by one of the principal governments of western Europe and the labour secretary of the United States. So let Australians understand that he is out of touch and out of step. When they talk about his vile and vicious policies, they are about ripping away at the incomes of ordinary Australians which he then says, hypocritically, he wishes to defend. I thought they were very instructive comments from both these people—the US labour secretary and the new French President—indicating how now completely out of step and how heartless are the views of the current opposition of Australia led by this failure, the Leader of the Opposition.

         The background to this matter is that I commissioned an independent Australian law professor, Professor Cheryl Saunders AO, to conduct an independent inquiry and prepare a report for me in accordance with the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act. Professor Saunders conducted that investigation. She heard and weighed up a wide range of views. In fact, she received some 400 separate representations. Her report is publicly available, and its conclusions about the significance of the Hindmarsh Island area to the Aboriginal women concerned are clear.

        That is what I as the responsible minister was told after having done everything I was required to do under federal legislation to commission that independent report. I rebut the myth that somehow or other my decision was based on secret information. I can categorically assure this House that that was never the case. In fact, my decision was based on the publicly available report of Professor Saunders and the representations that were made. It is true that there have been accusations in the media and now by the shadow minister in the parliament attempting to attack my bona fides and attempting to dispute the basis of the decision.

It was indicated that the priorities in relation to the further development of the better cities program would relate to, firstly, infrastructure, particularly access to ports, rail and so on; secondly, the issue of growth areas and the pressures that various growth areas in terms of Australian cities are facing; and, thirdly, the question of urban renewal and revitalisation. As Australian cities get older, there is more room to look at the potential for revitalisation.

         The Leader of the Opposition made a visit to Launceston last week. As the honourable member for Bass would point out, he was met with a considerable degree of enthusiasm about the better cities project in that city. It is a very important redevelopment of the Inveresk railway yards. It represents a revival of a central area of Launceston which is important to the city and which is located close to the river. It draws attention to one of the real positives in the city of Launceston.

         The Leader of the Opposition made it clear that he would support better cities projects `where they were worth while'. What that indicates on the part of the Leader of the Opposition is, if you like, a case by case approach to policy. Effectively, the Leader of the Opposition is going to wander around Australia and when he sees something that is politically opportunistic for him to support, he is going to put his hand up and say, `That's worth while.' If on the grounds of political opportunism he decides otherwise, he is going to say, `No, we won't support that.' It would all be done simply on a case by case basis.

Those who have an interest in the program and the particular locations it supports should take the views of the member for Maranoa. He believes that the fact that better cities mark I supported projects in cities like Bunbury, Launceston, Mackay, Townsville or Newcastle—cities that are certainly not within the metropolitan area—was representative of some kind of urban bias.

It is investment that is growing in terms of many of those areas' strategies. It is helping to address issues that the Australian people see as of extraordinary importance.

         The Leader of the Opposition can laugh as much as he likes, but I do not think the Australian people are going to vote for an opposition that, in the most urbanised country in the world, reflects no policy interest, has no perception about the problems facing Australian cities and has no capacity to say anything sensible about an issue that is extraordinarily important to people who live in the growth areas, who live in the areas that require urban renewal and who recognise that if Australia is to be able to compete with the Asia-Pacific region it needs damn good infrastructure. The better cities program will play a role, together with the states and local governments, in providing that infrastructure in a timely and effective manner.

It is important that I put the comments of the member for Hindmarsh in context because this is, as I said on 23 May, part of an orchestrated campaign by the member for Barker and her—which is supported by the Leader of the Opposition—to undermine the spiritual beliefs of the Aboriginal women who have been at the centre of this attempt to protect their Aboriginal heritage. I said that on 23 May and out it came the next day in an article entitled `Lib at the heart of women's business furore'. The article went on to talk about a member of the member for Deakin's staff who said that her skills had been useful `in putting it all together'. It went on to tell us a lot more about the fellow travellers of the Liberal Party.

         This is the same shadow Attorney-General who has had carriage of the opposition's policy in this matter—and this is one of the few matters where the opposition actually does have a stated policy. It has actually produced a document. I know it is a bit rare and people are a bit shocked by this, but this is actually a field where the opposition has produced a policy and put it out into the public domain. The reaction to it explains why the opposition generally does not have policies. We see, for instance, in today's newspapers comments—not only about the opposition's policy but specifically about this shabby little leaflet put out by Senator Vanstone—such as `Liberal paper angers ethnics', `Howard attacked over race issues', `Strife over racism pamphlet', `Anger at Liberal pamphlet'.

         —It might as readily be concluded that behaviour of members opposite has had that effect. The legislative amendments were actually brought in in December last year, so we have had some few months for the legislation to be operative. In that relatively short time, generic substitution has in fact—I draw the shadow spokesperson's attention to this—increased by nearly eight per cent.

         That is a very significant saving for Australians. It is not a saving to government; it means simply that ordinary Australian families pay less. I would have hoped that the shadow minister would have been encouraging doctors and pharmacists to cooperate with this program. It is a very straightforward matter. It is a matter of rebutting some scare tactics that have been developed, particularly by some of the pharmaceutical companies.

         In order to ensure that the community generally is well informed about generic substitution, we are launching a communication strategy to build on that success, that eight per cent increase. The information will go to pharmacists, to doctors, and to consumers of large quantities of medication for various reasons. Money can be saved and should be saved. I would hope the opposition will support these measures which mean that, in this case, the consumers and others save the taxpayers considerable funds by very important services being delivered to the Australian community.

         I thank the member for her question. I would hope that those people who are fair minded will see that this will grow over time. It is basically for ordinary Australian families. It does not save the government any money; it does not save the doctors any money; it does not save the chemists any money; but it does save those ordinary Australians a lot. I hope we get the support of the opposition.

The Prime Minister quoted from Mr Colebatch's article which tried to make the point as its centrepiece that the coalition would be calling for a $10 billion cut in spending. The claim was made by Mr Colebatch because he, in fact, had marked out the wrong year—1995-96 rather than 1996-97—which I had referred to at the National Press Club. I took the opportunity of correcting that with a letter to the
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">

If the Prime Minister had gone to the full record, including the correction and the acknowledgment by Mr Colebatch, he would not have engaged in that deceptive conduct.

In that speech, I referred to the introduction of a black spots roads program and the linking Australia fund as part of coalition policy. To suggest otherwise is utter nonsense.

        —On 16 May 1995 on radio 2GB, the new broadcaster, Mr Peter Anderson, made two statements about me which were grossly untrue and defamatory. The first of these was when he alleged that I had complained about recruitment of ethnic communities into the Labor Party in my electorate and `what a terrible thing that was'. If Mr Anderson had bothered to read my public statements, he would have known that I never made any such claims about ethnic branch stacking or ethnic communities.

        The second misrepresentation followed immediately when Mr Anderson implied that I myself had been involved in and supported ethnic branch stacking. He claimed that I had been silent when someone he described as one of my mates had used this tactic to undermine and unseat the honourable member for Fowler (Mr Grace) but had then changed his mind and knocked off Mr Anderson instead in the state seat of Liverpool.

        I have never been involved in, nor condoned, the manipulation of ethnic communities in this way.

        The petition of certain citizens of Australia draws to the attention of the House the huge service gap in a wide area of North West Victoria in respect to the provision of mobile telephone services. In an area which covers almost a quarter of the State of Victoria less than 15 per cent is serviced by mobile telephone. Quick communication is no longer seen as a luxury but a necessity both in the business and private world and the communities concerned would benefit both economically and socially through the availability of a mobile telephone system.

         —I wish to bring to the attention of this House an astonishing story of an Australian family's 50-year long struggle to solve the mystery surrounding the death of a very brave, very courageous Australian airman during World War II. In the year when all Australians have been encouraged to take part in the commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II, one of my constituents is piecing together the final parts of a mystery that started on 5 June 1944, when a Royal Air Force Lancaster bomber was shot down over France. Ever since that tragic event Mr Newton Roberts of Bunbury, Western Australia has not known the final resting place of his brother Ken, who was the Australian pilot and captain of the Lancaster bomber inscribed `LL-783' and known as `Cinders of the Clouds'. His body was never found or formally identified. He was listed as missing in action. However, over the years the amazing story of flight lieutenant Kim Roberts' last bombing raid has emerged. Yet even now his brother Newton Roberts does not know where, or indeed if, his brother was buried.

         In March 1944, three months before he was killed in action at the age of 21, Kim Roberts was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross, an immediate award as opposed to those decorated on the completion of a tour, usually 30 operations. On a bombing mission over Stuttgart his Lancaster was hit by enemy fire but he managed to manoeuvre his plane and shoot down the attacking enemy aircraft. The citation read:

         Pilot officer Roberts then completed his bombing run and afterwards flew the damaged aircraft to base. This officer and his airmen displayed commendable skill, courage and coolness.

       <para>
        On the night of D-Day, Kim Roberts and his English crew had bombed a bridge 175 kilometres west of Paris. He was heading back to base at Dunholme Lodge in England, where his Lancaster bomber, a veteran of some 29 successful bombing missions over Germany and Europe, was attacked while approaching the Cherbourg Peninsula by a German fighter. His plane was badly hit. Two of the crew parachuted to safety and are alive in England today, after spending the rest of the war as prisoners of war. Their plane crashed and burst into flames, killing all of the occupants.

       <para first-indent="16">

         The survivors, Jack Forrest and Reg De Viell, were contacted just three years ago, when researchers in France uncovered debris from the Lancaster bomber in a farmer's field in Normandy. For nearly 50 years they had wondered what had happened to their comrades and the destiny of their aircraft. Forrest and De Viell visited France, not expecting to find any trace of their Lancaster. It was with great emotion that they learnt of the fate of their aircraft, which had crashed in a flooded field. Numerous pieces of rusty aircraft frame and engine were found still lying in the field. With the assistance of the local French mayor and some journalists, Forrest and De Viell discovered the graves of four of their crew: Navigator/Pilot Officer J. Lott, Radio Operator Flight Sergeant J. Tucker, and two gunners, Flight Sergeant L. Williams and Flying Officer G. Wyand. They were able to establish that, seconds after they jumped from the plane, two other crewmen also jumped but died when their parachutes failed to open as the plane was too low. All the crew members' graves were found in two French military cemeteries, but there was no grave for the plane's skipper, Flight Lieutenant Kim Roberts.

         There is far more to this mystery than an Australian pilot missing in action. This particular pilot just happened to be wearing a rather special keepsake around his neck. It was Hermann Goering's own Iron Cross medal and had been given to Flight Lieutenant Roberts by a neighbour in Bunbury, Western Australia. As members will know, Hermann Goering was a German flying ace during World War I and later became Adolf Hitler's second in command. He headed the feared German Luftwaffe during World War II. But during World War I Hermann Goering had shot down approximately 27 aircraft. The pilot of the seventh plane he brought down was a man called Frank Slee, who lived across the road from Kim Roberts' home in Stirling Street, Bunbury, Western Australia.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Before Kim Roberts left for overseas duties, Slee gave him the medal and told him to keep it as a memento. He said Goering had given him the Iron Cross as a memento of their dogfight, an incident described in Goering's biography published in 1950. After the battle, Goering simply landed his plane, walked up to Slee, shook his hand and gave him his own inscribed Iron Cross medal.

         Kim Roberts did exactly what Slee had asked him. He kept the medal around his neck and never took it off. In fact, according to the two survivors, Forest and De Viell, the medal became a mascot for the crew and Kim Roberts would wave it around his neck to urge them on. Indeed, one theory of this amazing mystery is that after the Lancaster crashed, Kim Roberts may have been mistaken for a German because of the different colour of the Australian uniform and the fact that he was wearing the Iron Cross.

         It could be that an Australian pilot who gave his life for his country was buried as a German and, for the last 50 years, this has been one of the doubts that Kim Roberts's family has had to live with. After years of painstaking research, they now know exactly where the plane went down. They know precisely what happened to everyone on the plane except the pilot, Flight Lieutenant Kim Roberts. Researchers are also considering the possibility that Kim Roberts was thrown from the plane on impact and his body is still laying beneath the mud in the farmer's field in Normandy.

         The French have expressed considerable interest in this event and have provided considerable assistance to researchers. The local mayor has written to my constituent and taken part in a special ceremony with the two British survivors to mark the 50th anniversary of D-day. They have located a farmer who was only 15 years old at the time and who has told how he saw the crippled bomber flying at rooftop height. The farmer said that the pilot was still at the controls and was struggling to avoid nearby buildings, before ditching the plane in a field. He said that the plane finally crashed to the ground about 200 metres from his farmhouse and broke up, bursting into flames on impact. The tail section broke away from the cockpit and wings which, fed by the remaining fuel, became an inferno. Local villagers gathered around the wreckage of the tail section and noticed the two bodies inside. All four bodies were buried and later interred in local cemeteries.

         As with many tragedies that occurred during the war, the events of 50 years ago are somewhat clouded in the memories of the people who experienced them. As time goes by, their memories fade, and that is precisely why part of the Australia Remembers program has focused on collecting and recording the eyewitness accounts before they are lost forever.

         My constituent, Flight Lieutenant Kim Roberts's brother, has asked for government assistance to go to France and visit the place where his brother's plane went down and to place a memorial in the village church. I have passed on his wishes to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Sciacca). I urge the minister to help the Roberts family to put the final pieces of this mystery together and to place a lasting reminder of Flight Lieutenant Kim Roberts's final bombing mission in France where his plane went down. In the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II and the year when Australia remembers all those who served their country, I urge the minister to offer every assistance to the Roberts family so that they can  complete the final chapter in this very unfinished mystery.

         —I would like to speak about the issue of gun ownership and gun control, which has received quite a deal of publicity lately, particularly with the recent spate of killings in Brisbane and other places. I, like any parent, naturally feel very sorry for the family of the teenager Matthew Easdale who was shot while breaking into a home in Brisbane, regardless of the circumstances. At the same time, I can understand the actions of the home owner in the situation in which he was placed. Needless to say, a young man has died because of some of the problems we have with gun ownership.

         However, what I cannot understand is the rash of impetuous and premature calls for the relaxation of the laws relating to gun ownership in Australia. The rationale amongst some groups seems to be that the only way to make society safer is to introduce more guns. I should think not.

         As I said, I can understand the actions of the home owners in the recent burglary case in Brisbane where someone was shot and tragically killed. I do not in any way condone the actions of the victims in these cases, who were after all breaking the law by attempting to enter the home of private citizens. I do not feel qualified to make a judgment one way or the other as to whether or not they deserved to die for what they were doing. As far as I am concerned, nobody is qualified to make that judgment, and certainly not the groups which called for more guns to be made available for citizens to use.

         What is most disappointing is the fact that so many different groups have jumped on this bandwagon and used these tragic incidents to promote their own political agendas. To some extent, this has been encouraged by some, with governments using the law and order debate in election campaigns. This is certainly the case in Queensland, where the opposition has used it to try to score cheap political points on the government. The opposition knows that it cannot match the Labor government's policies. The Queensland National Party leader, Rob Borbidge, admitted as much last week when he said that the opposition would not release its policies to the voters. That is nothing unusual for us when dealing with the federal opposition. I wonder if those opposite have the same problem. Is that why we are not seeing any policies from the federal opposition?

         Central to this law and order debate is the issue of gun ownership. Since these tragic incidents, we have seen all sorts of people come out of the woodwork and use these shootings to justify their views on why guns should be more readily available in Australia. Most commonly, they quite shamelessly try to frighten ordinary Australians into believing that we are living in a lawless society with crime—particularly violent crime—increasing rapidly.

         However, figures show this attempt to be nothing more than scaremongering. They are preying on the fears—real or imagined—of citizens. Statistics show that there has been little or no increase in violent crime in Australia over the last decade. According to surveys by the Australian Bureau of Statistics, rates of more serious crimes have not risen in Queensland in recent years. For example, three per cent of respondents to such a survey in 1983 said that they had been assaulted. In a 1993 survey, this figure was unchanged. In the case of break and enter offences—which are most relevant to this matter—there was a slight rise from 5.8 per cent in 1983 to 7.5 per cent in 1993. Recent police figures from Queensland show that there was a 25 per cent increase in break and enters in 1994 from the previous year, but the overwhelming majority of these were not the so-called `home invasions', which has become a bit of a byword lately and an emotional one at that.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Most break and enters still occur while the home owner is out, and the burglar's main objective is to steal property and get away undetected—not to harm defenceless people. Just the same, they need to be deterred. The issue of stiffer penalties for breaking and entering is another that may be debated some day. It is a matter of some debate at the moment.

         Most robbers are smart enough to commit their crime when the owner is out. I am not defending them—they should be punished with the full weight of the law, which they are when they are apprehended—but I just make the point that there is no evidence to support claims from some groups that we need increased gun ownership in Australia.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Of course, this will always be an emotive and controversial issue—anything that involves crime against personal property with the added risk of injury is a serious matter. I am appalled at the way many groups have come out and had a feeding frenzy with this issue. For example, we would all know of the continuing attempt over the years by the Australian Firearms Owners' Association to influence both public opinion and governments into making gun ownership easier in Australia. I am sure most members in this House would know that the government has not always seen eye to eye with the association on this issue. After its comments on Matthew Easdale's shooting, I do not think things will change much.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Mr Ian McNiven, the association's vice-chairman, went on national radio and said that Easdale's death was an example of `the blood price' Australians have to pay to live in `a safer society'. Despite the fact that the figures I quoted illustrate that society is no more dangerous than it was, Mr McNiven was attempting to frighten people into thinking that society is increasingly lawless. But the most shocking thing was his reference to a `blood price'. The very notion that we should accept a young man's death as natural and normal is abhorrent. As I said before, Easdale had no business being where he was or doing what he was doing. The situations were extreme and they prompted extreme actions from the home owner. I would hate to think that Mr McNiven would sanction such action in every case, almost as if it were a standard procedure.

         The truly frightening aspect of the gun lobby's agenda is the risk of extremist political groups taking advantage of easier gun ownership laws to make their point, as we have seen in the United States recently with the Oklahoma bombing and the Waco siege, involving the Branch Davidian sect. There are already enough extremist groups in this country to worry about without encouraging them to take up arms.

         from 23 May illustrates the danger. Some far right wing groups have published and continue to publish material from American individuals who have been linked with the Michigan Militia, responsible for the Oklahoma bombing. A cursory glance at any of these publications is enough to satisfy any normal thinking individual that these people are considerably removed from the mainstream political debate.

Could anyone please explain to me how terrorism can be used in a positive way?

         As is usually the case with such groups, conspiracy theories abound. They believe that the financial system is conspiring with the UN and other governments in order to form a single government and take over the world. As a result of this, they encourage their supporters to be prepared to take up arms and defend themselves against the coming takeover. You probably do not need to be told that they endorse a fundamentalist Christianity and they approve of a deep hatred and distrust of governments, banks, communism, Jews, Asians, Aboriginals and just about anyone else who does not fit in with their ideas of what is normal.

         For this reason, I would not like to see an increase in the number of guns in Australia, nor do I think the gun ownership laws should be relaxed. It is too great a risk. I acknowledge that there will always be situations, like Matthew Easdale's death, that will test opinions on this issue. I am not saying that there will ever be a perfect world, because we know there will not be, but we do not need to let irrational fears rule us on this issue. In fact, I cannot think of anything that requires more reasoned thought and caution than this issue.

         I conclude by making some reference to the days before I came into the parliament when I worked in the banking industry and was involved in the banking union. I was also on the national standing committee on bank security. That was an area in which we worked very hard, through the union, trying to ensure that commonsense gun laws were consistent across this country. From that experience and from knowing a lot of unassuming bank employees who actually had the terrible experience of looking down the barrel of a gun during bank hold-ups, I can always grieve for the people I knew who were involved in those situations and understand how it affected their lives.

         Australia really needs to address our problems of law and order, which any country has at present, with a much more commonsense approach than these knee-jerk reactions of people demanding things like lesser gun laws rather than demanding tighter laws so that people do not have access to those sorts of weapons that can only harm our society. Mr Deputy Speaker, I thank you for the opportunity to raise this issue today.

         —Later today the cabinet is meeting to revisit the criteria surrounding the eligibility for drought stricken farmers to qualify for exceptional circumstances assistance. I believe it is a disgrace that today, 29 May, less than three days before winter officially starts, the cabinet is finally bothering itself to look at this issue. The drought, hopefully, could very well be breaking, but we have a situation where the exceptional circumstances assistance that has been given so far has benefited barely four per cent of New South Wales farmers. That is despite New South Wales at one stage just recently being 98 per cent in drought.

         I remind the government that while it dithers on this there are rural lands protection boards in my electorate such as Dubbo, Nyngan, Cobar and Condobolin—just to mention a few—that do not qualify for exceptional circumstances assistance, but the need out there is so desperate that these people have been getting food parcels distributed to them for several months now. In that regard, I would like to pay a high tribute to Jenny Butt of Canberra.

I must say that I was very honoured to be associated in a small way by helping to organise some of the distribution drop-offs in my electorate.

         You might be interested to hear how drought affects people. There is widespread depression amongst men and women—it's sometimes subtle and sometimes not so subtle.

Innovation and micro-economic reform are enabling Australia to confidently lead the way to freer trade in Asia.

         Under the policies of the Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), when he was in government, Australia was inward looking, protectionist and riddled with industrial strife. Micro-economic reform is about the work force and management working together to achieve and exceed best practice; it is not about block outs, secret ballots and denying the rights of workers to union representation.

         The Leader of the Opposition is known for his longstanding and inflexible opinions on industrial relations. They colour his view on Hilmer and competition policy. In question time today, in referring to Hilmer, the Leader of the Opposition called on the federal government to back the Western Australian government in a dispute over the awarding of a stevedoring contract to a non-unionised company. For the Leader of the Opposition, competition policy is not a matter of achieving better outcomes; it is simply about trampling on the hard won rights of working people. The Keating government has made significant progress in micro-economic reform and has achieved real benefits for industry.

         Micro-economic reform is a key mechanism for improving the business operating environment. It is aimed at improving the way in which an economy uses its resources. Micro-economic reform involves removing unnecessary burdens on business and minimising the costs of business inputs. This Labor government has an enviable record of achievement in introducing reforms in areas such as tariffs and quotas, capital markets, aviation and telecommunications. With the removal of the two-airline policy we have seen improvements in the services provided and reductions in airfares. For example, average domestic fares at the end of 1993 were 24 per cent lower in real terms than prior to deregulation.

         With the deregulation of the telecommunications market, international rates for long-distance calls have fallen by more than 25 per cent in the past four years. Following reduced levels of protection from foreign competition, our exports of manufactures grew at an annual rate of 14.2 per cent from 1984 to 1992. The pressure for reform applied by the federal Labor government has initiated great increases in operating efficiency in areas such as electricity generation.

         Overall, the major benefit of micro-economic reform is that Australia is now better positioned to achieve sustainable economic and employment growth without the inflationary strains of the late 1980s. The Keating government has accomplished yet another achievement with the recent agreement with the states and territories to implement a new national competition policy regime. This agreement will apply intense competitive pressure across all industry sectors. As a consequence, at all levels of government the fundamentals of competitiveness such as innovation, science and technology, and education and training will be examined.

         It is clear that the dynamic nature of the reform process means adjustment and that not all may benefit equally from the changes. That is why the government has made sure that continued pursuit of micro-economic reform is also consistent with the employment thrust of Working Nation. As a government we reject the Liberal Party's doctrinaire approach to reform that would ignore the values of Australian workers.

         The Leader of the Opposition should listen to CRA's senior executive, David Karpin. Following an extensive three-year study, the Karpin report on leadership and management skills describes a lack of depth in Australian management. In particular, it was noted that, relative to other countries, managers in Australia are not as skilled in their functional expertise as the workers they manage are in theirs. This finding reinforces the importance of involving workers in the process of change.

         Micro-economic reform is not a process that can be imposed by government fiat, as the opposition imagines. Under the member for Bennelong, Australia would be returning to the industrial disputation of the Fraser-Howard era. This government wants all Australians, especially the disadvantaged and the long-term unemployed, to ultimately benefit from the changes brought about by the reform process. While micro-economic reform is fundamental to building an innovative culture in Australia, it is also fundamental to reaping the rewards of Australian creativity and invention and to putting the clever country into action.

         Trade liberalisation and developments in Asia have opened up bigger markets for Australian industry. The accessibility of these markets increases the rewards for innovation, greater efficiency and productivity. Globalisation means that investment is more footloose and difficult to attract or hold onto—another challenge we face. To meet these challenges, the federal government is committed to continual reform, particularly the reform measures under the umbrella of a national competition policy. In doing so, the government is supporting those disadvantaged by the dynamic nature of adjustment.

         What would members of the opposition do if they gained government? Whilst we do not have their policies, we do know their prejudices. The Liberals want the burden of structural adjustment to be borne by working people; the Nationals want their constituents to be protected from any change. That is why there are no opposition policies on issues as fundamental as the Hilmer competition policy reforms. What is the opposition's record on tackling economic reform? In government, under Malcolm Fraser, it avoided every hard issue. Its policies caused double digit inflation, double digit interest rates and double digit unemployment. Its low wage policies simply led to low productivity growth and destroyed Australian competitiveness.

         The Australian people will not exchange the government's sound policies and record of achievement on innovation and micro-economic reform for the opposition's absence of policies and record of failure. The only historical record that we have on policy from the Leader of the Opposition is his support for the disastrous Fightback policy espoused by Dr Hewson during the last federal campaign. That included a commitment to a goods and services tax of 15 per cent; slashing government expenditure by over $10,000 million; a zero tariff policy as modified by the National Party in certain sectors; and, above all, the abolition of Medicare, except for health cardholders and pensioners. The opposition has a tradition of underestimating the intelligence of the Australian electorate. Prejudices and absence of policy are no substitute for sound economic policy.

         —In today's grievance debate I wish to raise my concern that the Minister for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Affairs (Mr Tickner) failed in his duty to seek and consider the knowledge and opinions of all Ngarrindjeri women regarding secret women's business in his decision to ban the building of Hindmarsh Island bridge. Further, the minister, through his emissary, Professor Cheryl Saunders and others, failed to establish the bona fides of the women making the claims and the likelihood that they could be the custodians.

         This has caused a severe set back to the process of reconciliation and cast suspicion over genuine claims. Let us consider the key women who say they do not believe the `women's business' to be true. Mrs Dulcie Wilson, aged 64, is a highly respected Ngarrindjeri elder who was born and brought up at Point McLeay—the home of the Ngarrindjeri tribe since the 1850s—and lived there until aged in her 80s. She was citizen of the year in her home town of Millicent, a former ATSIC councillor and so highly respected by the Salvation Army that she was asked to represent the women of Australia at Westminster in the 1950s. Her late husband, Lindsay, was a noted Ngarrindjeri historian and an authority on the customs and beliefs of his people.

         Mrs Dorothy Wilson, a 48-year-old grandmother, says that she was involved from the beginning, when on 6 May 1994 a group of 16 women first met at Goolwa and wrote to Minister Tickner asking him to stop the bridge. Dorothy Wilson was program director of the Murray Bridge Nunga's Club, which caters for the local Ngarrindjeri community, and she appears on a poster honouring Aboriginal achievers of Murray Bridge. In a statutory declaration she says, `My grandmother was a Ramindjeri woman and my grandfather was from the Yaraldi tribe,' both of whom camped seasonally on Hindmarsh Island. Mrs Wilson can genuinely lay claim to being a descendent of the tribes that camped on Hindmarsh Island. She spoke out because she could no longer live with the conspiracy that others sought to hide.

         Then there is 74-year-old Ngarrindjeri elder, Mrs Bertha Gollan, who says that she could not risk going to her grave living a lie. She has been quoted as saying, `How can I lie to my daughters?' Born and brought up at Point McLeay, Mrs Gollan is the first to admit that her mother's tribe is from the south-east of South Australia and, therefore, could not possibly have known of this so-called `secret women's business'.

Until last week—when suddenly the claims of the breakaway five were made—she claimed to be sole custodian of the `secret women's business' and its location.

          —by leave—The report of the Joint Standing Committee on the National Capital and External Territories deals with the proposed restoration of the King George V memorial currently located in the parliamentary zone. The memorial commemorates King George V, the monarch at the time of the opening of the Old Parliament House. The memorial is classified by the National Trust and has been entered on the Register of the National Estate.

          On 2 March 1995, the Minister for Housing and Regional Development (Mr Howe) wrote to the committee referring to it the proposed restoration of the memorial, including the removal of two Lombardy poplars which flank the memorial. The memorial consists of a central brick pylon faced with sandstone blocks. There is a 4.5 metre copper alloy statue of King George V facing east and a sandstone figure of St George on horseback facing west. Ten commemorative inscriptions are inscribed on the sandstone, at the base and high on the pylon, and nine copper alloy bas-relief plaques have been placed around the work.

Sir Henry Parkes is there and so is Sir Samuel Griffith, commemorating the first federal convention in 1891. The opening of the first federal parliament in 1901 is recalled by their Royal Highnesses the Duke and Duchess of York. There is also the inscription commemorating the 26-year reign of King George V.

          The committee is aware that questions over the siting of the memorial and the ongoing need for repairs have dogged the memorial for over 50 years. The memorial was originally erected in 1943 on a large podium directly in front of the Old Parliament House. From that time, concern was raised about the location of the memorial. It was moved in 1968 to its present location to the west of the front of the Old Parliament House.

          On its present site, the memorial is surrounded by a granite paved area and the original large podium has been replaced by a smaller platform. The memorial is flanked by two mature Lombardy poplars. Public access to the memorial has not been possible since October 1991 because of the concern about public safety and continuing damage to the memorial. The root systems of the poplars have caused damage to paving surrounding the memorial, causing a tripping hazard. Fine roots have penetrated the stone work of the memorial's plinth and the location of the two Lombardy poplars restricts access to the memorial for maintenance work.

          Based on the evidence, the committee accepts that it is necessary to remove the Lombardy poplars, although the committee regrets that such a problem was not foreseen when the memorial was moved to its present location. In his letter to the committee, the minister said that the matter of the final location of the memorial is still undecided. The committee notes that the memorial has been on its present site for most of its existence and that the issue of a change in its location would be difficult to resolve. Therefore, it is the committee's recommendation that the King George V memorial remain permanently on its present site.

          The committee is concerned that the failure to carry out maintenance on the memorial since 1968 has contributed to the urgent need to undertake the work to restore the memorial before a decision could be made on the permanent location of the memorial.

Under this authority the report was released on 18 May 1995.

          The report is the outcome of a reference given to the committee on 28 March 1995 by the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton). Given the importance of the bills and the need to establish the two new aviation authorities by 1 July 1995, the committee moved quickly. On 30 and 31 March the bills and their explanatory memoranda were sent to organisations which were asked to make submissions by 20 April 1995. Evidence was taken at a public hearing on 26 April. Report consideration commenced on 10 May, and the amended report was accepted by the committee the next day.

          I turn to the report. We say it has three objectives: first, to comment on whether the bills are necessary; second, given the first point, to examine whether the bills meet their basic purposes; and, third, to advise the House on the need for amendments that would improve the quality of the bills, including advice on the second point. In examining the need for the two bills the committee drew the following conclusion: there is broad support for the establishment of an independent aviation safety authority. The committee endorses this approach. The creation of a new authority with a new and more specialised board and a new director is a far better solution for the troubled and turbulent world of aviation safety regulation in Australia than any reorganisation within the existing Civil Aviation Authority.

          The committee recognised the limits of the legislation. We said that the establishment of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, or CASA, by itself is not the only cure of the problems that have beset the administration of aviation safety in Australia. At the end of the day, it is the board of CASA and its director that must be responsible for the administration of aviation. The key issue then is accountability. We emphasise that CASA should be accountable to the minister, the parliament and the courts and to no-one else.

          The remaining two report objectives are combined in the two chapters that examine separately each of the bills. The experience gained by the committee in the aviation safety inquiry lead it to emphasise the need for clarity in the bill that establishes CASA. The report states:
         </tab>
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         The Bill should set out clearly, precisely and comprehensively the functions of the aviation safety regulator, CASA. Then the regulator, the aviation industry and others would know what is the job of CASA. Clearly prescribed functions would also enable the Parliament to gauge the effectiveness of CASA.
        </para>
        <para>
         Unfortunately, this clarity is absent in the bill. We welcomed the innovation of an object clause but found confusion between object and functions. The two words were used interchangeably and there was duplication and, in our opinion, too much detail in the object clause.

        <para first-indent="16">

          The view of the committee was that clarity would be promoted and confusion reduced if the object clause is a broad in-principle statement of purpose. Then the more detailed functions of the object clause could be transferred to the section on functions. Paragraph 3.12 of the report sets out the committee version of the object clause. We want a short in-principle statement of purpose along the lines set out in the paragraph.

          I turn to functions, the next key feature of the bill. Once again with clarity in mind, the committee said that, rather than a simple listing, functions should have a three tier classification. Functions should be classified according to whether they are, first, primary or core functions; secondly, functions related to those primary or core functions; and, thirdly, other functions. The report makes several recommendations on functions. Once again, the committee is not wedded to the detail. We are, however, convinced of the need to bring all the functions into the one place, of the necessity to classify functions and of the need to avoid duplication.

          I have mentioned the need for accountability. Two aspects of the bill concern the committee. The first is paragraph 3A(g) of the object clause, which states:

         The committee has several concerns about this paragraph. The most serious is that of regulatory capture. This would happen if CASA, the regulator, is seen to be accountable to the industry, the regulated. Our recommendation is that paragraph 3A(g) be either deleted or redrafted.

          Another area of concern covers the corporate plan. Briefly, we believe that the corporate plan that the minister approves should be tabled in both houses with expedition. This covers both the Civil Aviation Safety Authority and Air Services Australia. Several other aspects of the report will be covered by our inquiry into aviation safety. I again thank my colleagues and the secretariat for their assistance in this rapid task we undertook. I commend the report to the House.

         —I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak in support of the Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 1995-96. As the Treasurer (Mr Willis) said in the lead-up to the budget, a number of important issues need to be addressed. The first issue was to accelerate the process of the deficit reduction strategies that had been outlined last year. The next issue was to ensure that we provided a comprehensive medium-term strategy to boost national savings. Underlying all of those things was the test of ensuring that we made a real contribution to dealing with the major challenge of the current account deficit.

         In his response to the budget, the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) said that there were a number of tests to determine what should be done in the budget. Unfortunately, obviously one of the tests that did not apply to the Leader of the Opposition was to actually outline any policy. It was very clear from listening to his response to the budget that he still has not developed any policy that he is prepared to put before the Australian people.

         That was reinforced in the speech made at the press club by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Costello). The only thing he proposed at that stage that was of any note was the commission of audit that will be reporting on contingent liabilities of the Commonwealth, including public service superannuation, et cetera. The only thing we can say about the commission of audit is that it is the alibi for the slash and burn tactics that the opposition is hoping to get away with after the next election rather than outlining any detailed policies and taking the people of Australia into its confidence prior to the election.

         The important thing about this year's budget is that it achieves the objectives we set. First of all, we get the budget back into surplus this year. The structural position of the budget will improve dramatically in 1996-97. In 1996-97, even leaving aside the asset sales that are outlined in this year's budget, there will be a surplus of $3.4 billion. The budget surplus this year has been achieved through a combination of fiscal tightening, revenue measures and asset sales; that is, looking at all the elements that go to make up the budget quite properly and trying to ensure that we take steps to maintain a sustainable level of economic growth. The budget forecast, which no-one has challenged this year, of around 3 3/4 per cent is a very achievable target. Indeed, the Secretary to the Treasury said recently that he believed that target could be exceeded through sustainable, low inflationary growth.

       <para first-indent="16">

         One of the other key tenets of what policy has to be about is ensuring that we maintain the benefits of the low inflationary environment which have been one of the major achievements of recent years and which are clearly part of our future competitiveness. It must be built on maintenance of low inflation and growth and it must be built on productivity but with inflation being kept at realistically low levels.

         The other important consideration in sustaining the recovery is to ensure that interest rates are kept at the lowest levels possible. Since the budget we have seen some of those interest rates—both the variable home loan rates and the fixed home loan rates—starting to come down. Certainly, there has been a stabilisation of interest rates through this year. Again, we can see the right ingredients to have sustainable economic recovery now and to build stronger economic fundamentals in the economy in the years to come.

         One of the key initiatives in this year's budget relates to our plan for national savings. The cornerstone of that plan relates to superannuation. As everyone would be aware, up until now the government had outlined a strategy on superannuation to ensure that we achieved a nine per cent employer contribution by the year 2002. The measures announced in the budget ensure that, in addition to that nine per cent, we will now have a three per cent employee contribution and a matching three per cent contribution from the government. So, effectively, what we will have from the year 2000 onwards is a situation where the vast majority of workers will have a 15 per cent retirement income superannuation component. This will help to ensure higher retirement incomes for them as individuals but it will also dramatically add to national savings which the whole nation benefits from in the future. That is the key element in ensuring that we mount the proper attack on our current account deficit.

       <para first-indent="16">

         It is worth noting that superannuation savings today total just under $190 billion. The initiatives that have been outlined in the budget will provide a massive boost to superannuation savings and will ensure that we meet the challenges of national savings and of the ageing of the population. It will therefore ensure a higher quality of life for all Australians into the next century.

         The opposition's response has basically been to say, `We believe there should be tax breaks of some description for private savings rather than the regime that has been outlined by the government.' A few things should be noted here. First of all, the tax concessions already in the system for superannuation amount to about $5 billion. We also know that providing a tax break just for private savings will ensure the sort of situation we had prior to 1983. When the vast majority of people did not get access to superannuation, they became totally reliant on the age pension. The benefits for taxation breaks on superannuation essentially pointed to those on higher incomes and people on lower incomes missed out. That group that missed out certainly included part-time workers and it inevitably included women, who have missed out on superannuation until recent times. They did not add to national savings either. All they did was shift the tax arrangements from the public saving to the private saving for a select few.

         We believe superannuation should be much more than an initiative for a privileged few. There should be superannuation arrangements that benefit the whole community.

         Something else worth noting when we discuss superannuation is the criticism from the opposition that the budget measures are there to somehow benefit the unions and industry funds. There are a number of things that need to be said about the employee contribution outlined in the budget papers. The plan is to, in the future, have employee superannuation contributions paid out of wage rises negotiated through award arrangements and enterprise agreements. The contributions will amount to three per cent in the three-year phase in period. This is important because it ensures that they are built up in a way that does not undermine industrial relations and household incomes.

         It is also just as important to note that the arrangements are not inflexible, as has been suggested. The arrangements will ensure that contributions from the self-employed are paid into complying superannuation funds as part of their tax returns. The arrangements are not just there for the benefit of those in some industries and some unions.

         The suggestion that payments can only be made into industry funds is quite wrong. The fact is that an employee's contributions will be paid into the fund that their employer uses for superannuation guarantee contributions. It is logical to pay the funds into the existing fund that the employee has. This will ensure that it is cheaper and easier for employers. In addition, it ensures that we build up the savings of each person.

         It would obviously be foolhardy to encourage a situation where the superannuation contribution has to be paid into a new fund because it would not accumulate as quickly for the person making the contribution. The funds will be paid into whichever fund is receiving the superannuation guarantee payment. That will include industry funds, employer sponsored funds, master trusts and personal superannuation products. All of those funds can be appropriately structured to receive those superannuation guarantee payments. Absolutely no change will be made in that regard under the arrangements the government has outlined.

         There has also been a suggestion from the opposition that the answer to all these issues is to have superannuation savings accounts and that somehow they will provide a different way of boosting national savings. I will make a couple of points in that regard. There is no doubt that some of the funds will flow into superannuation products provided by banks, credit unions and other financial institutions. Banks and credit unions have been very successful for some time in selling superannuation over the counter.

         Last year the subsidiaries accounted for nearly a third of all personal superannuation premiums. Subsidiaries of banks and credit unions account for 35 of the 157 approved trustees able to sell public offer superannuation. There is a competitive environment in this area. The government says quite strongly that the same supervisory rules should apply to all superannuation funds. That is a prudentially sound thing to encourage.

         An important budget initiative this year in the area of national savings was the government's conscious decision to make superannuation the main form of national savings by reorienting the second tranche of tax cuts proposed in the One Nation statement to ensure that they boost the retirement incomes and superannuation savings of individuals and ensure that the people who get the benefit of that particular form of national saving are those on lower to middle incomes. We have a situation where the real benefit of the initiative the government has taken will go to every worker who has an income up to one to four times average weekly earnings. They will phase out at twice average weekly earnings.

         The benefit of the $4.5 billion per annum that the government will pay into individual superannuation accounts by the year 2002 will go to those people in the lower to middle income sector. They will get a real benefit out of the government matching the contribution. This measure will ensure a strong level of equity in the way the payment is paid. In my view, this is certainly preferable to the proposal that would have involved the second tranche of tax cuts going to the upper income sector. This would have been without the boost to national saving which would have been attached to it.

         It is very pleasing to note in the commentary on the budget that there has been a very strong endorsement of the government's proposals in the area of savings. The author of the previous report on national savings, Dr FitzGerald, made it clear that he thought this was a very positive step towards reaching the 18 per cent target that he believes is important for the future of superannuation savings for all Australians. Under these measures, we are ensuring that we achieve 15 per cent by the year 2002. Various others who have spoken and written about the budget initiative relating to superannuation have made clear that they strongly support the initiatives that have been taken in this regard.

         One of the key initiatives relates to coastal policy. Yesterday, the Minister for the Environment, Sport and Territories (Senator Faulkner) launched a major initiative in the area of coastal policy. That is something that I think the whole community should regard as important. The preservation of our natural areas and the future enjoyment of our beautiful coastline concerns all those who are increasingly worried about the damage being done to our coastline.

         In the area of environmental policy, the key initiative in this year's budget relates to the better cities program. The opposition has at times criticised this program. There are a number of important things that need to be said when we look at the better cities program. It is fundamentally designed to improve infrastructure, to look at the built environment and improve the quality of that built environment and to ensure that we have better public transport infrastructure.

All those measures are picked up in a budget to provide the ingredients we need to ensure that the natural environment and the built environment are given the right priority but, at the same time, ensuring that is done in a way that maintains the key economic fundamentals that are crucial in this year's budget—and they, of course, relate to ensuring that we achieve the budget surplus, ensuring that we have the structural surplus there for future years and ensuring, as a result of that, that interest rates can be kept at low levels and that, as a result of those measures, economic activity can grow.

         I want to touch on a couple of other issues relating to the appropriations. The first issue relates to the opposition constantly claiming, as it does, that there is a lack of commitment to micro-economic reform by the government and the fact that it does not put enough energy into that area. Of course, not long before the budget, we did have the important initiatives relating to the Hilmer report. The national competition policy was launched. Eventually it received the right priority from the states, who were difficult to drag along and had to be bought in that process.

This budget is all about building on that competitiveness, ensuring that we have sustainable economic growth for the future, ensuring that we have national savings built to the right levels—national savings that are genuine and long-term.

         It is time for the opposition to come forward and state clearly what it will do about national savings, rather than saying it will freeze everything and just give a tax break to a few. It has to be concerned, I suggest, to focus on national savings, to build on the strong superannuation initiatives we have taken, rather than continually knock and decry those initiatives which are in the long-term interests of all Australians. I commend the budget to the House.

         If the truth be known, the people of the electorate of Canberra and, indeed, all the residents of the Australian Capital Territory—all 300,000 of them—are often overlooked in statements made in our national press that attribute government decisions, Labor government decisions, to the people of Canberra. How often have we heard the lines, `Canberra's new tax', `Canberra decided tonight', `Canberra has resolved', `Canberra hasn't delivered again'. Throughout the by-election when doorknocking from the suburbs of Curtin to Chisholm, Rivett to Isabella Plains, one constant plea from all in my electorate was that the national press in the press gallery attribute to the Labor government its mistakes and not blame the 300,000 mainstream Australians who live in Canberra.

For example, one of our greatest treasures is the collections of the National Museum of Australia. They include extensive collections relating to indigenous Australians which remain without a permanent exhibition building and without funding. Here is a promise from the coalition: the National Museum of Australia will be built at Yarramundi by the year 2000 because, unlike those who sit across from me, the coalition is not embarrassed to display the collections that represent mainstream Australia.

The south-east region gives Canberra back much in exchange. Undeniably, the electorate of Canberra is a reflection of Australian society, boasting the most diverse array of cultural heritages.

I have a vested interest in Australia's youth not only as the father of twin daughters, who are here tonight, but also as a proud Australian who has ambition for this nation. I firmly believe that the creation of opportunities and the creation of jobs for our kids hold one of the keys to our success. We all know that youth unemployment is one of our major problems in this country, and Canberra is not immune. Surely, those on both sides of this House would agree with me when I say that this is not good enough.

         Finally, I want to talk about the Liberal Party. To do this I must say something of myself. I am a 35-year-old husband and father of two. Immediately before my career change into parliament, I was a public servant in this city and proud to be one. I have a mortgage, like most Australians, and I know what it is like to struggle. The slogan we used during the campaign—`He's one of us'—could not have been more apt.

         There is no doubt that the whole process surrounding this budget and its lead-up makes for a very busy time. Amid the flurry of activity—where words like `trade-off', `leaks' and `bids' and all sorts of economic jargon were commonplace—there may be a tendency for the public at large to overlook what the budget is really about. The budget is one part of the whole process of government and represents a major economic, social and political statement encompassing just about all government policy that can be expressed in money terms. Realistically, budgets are about jobs, markets, prices, quality of life and, above all, people.

         Our federal Labor government has concentrated on enhancing the quality of life for Australians. It has sought to create jobs, to improve living standards and to increase financial assistance for families, especially those on low incomes. The government has also addressed the problems associated with an ageing population. It has developed a national agenda for women, it has secured better work force entitlements for people with disabilities and it has ensured that environmental issues have high priority.

         As a fluid and ongoing document and process, this budget simply continues that framework. In the area of social security, for example, we examine demographic trends, the changing nature of work and the much greater degree of variability and flexibility in people's family structures, care roles and life patterns, making judgments about when and where people most need assistance. Take the case of families. Presently, in designing assistance for a broad range of families, we attempt to judge when people will require help. One such example is the additional family payment—or AFP as it is referred to—which is paid in accordance with a rate schedule that varies with the age of the child.

         Budget measures as we have here tonight build upon the many significant reforms already in place. This year's budget contains a whole host of measures that are bound to have positive effects in my electorate and will be significant in meeting not only the needs of the Prospect community with its high proportion of aged pensioners, recipients of DSS payments and large multicultural population but also the demands and needs of Australia in general. In my electorate, for instance, many social security reforms will make payments more responsive and targeted to customers' needs and will improve service delivery and payment arrangements for families and pensioners.

         Integrating the basic family payment and the additional family payment into one single payment and combining the assessment and review processes for family payment and child-care assistance will streamline payment applications. These sorts of changes are particularly important in an electorate—again, I emphasise—such as mine which has a high number of families with young children. I might elaborate for the House that, according to the 1991 census, of the 50 New South Wales seats, only 11 have more young residents aged five and under than my electorate. Some 24.9 per cent of the residents in my electorate are aged between zero and 14 years.

         While the budget shows the government is addressing the key issue [of savings], the opposition under John Howard is off on another track; the tax track.

        I have no doubt that the budget's superannuation savings initiative will be well received everywhere. Again, my area is no exception.

         Moves in the superannuation area recognise Australia's fast growing pool of temporary and casual workers and the radical changes experienced in the employment market. Moreover, this plan can be viewed as one which is addressing problems and disadvantages faced by many women who take low paid casual jobs which allow them to fit in with their family commitments but which do not offer the benefits of full-time work.

These people will be eligible to receive a matching contribution from the government that is more than three per cent of their own salary. All of these women earn less than average weekly earnings. So, if a person contributes more than three per cent of salary, it will be matched by the government up to that level of three per cent of average weekly earnings.

         As the representative of a very multicultural electorate, I appreciate and applaud the government's campaign to encourage employers to check work rights and immigration status of prospective employees. Currently, up to 64 per cent of people overstaying their Australian visas are working illegally. This employment awareness campaign run by the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs since 1991 has been very successful. A survey last year of employers found that more than 90 per cent wanted continued federal government assistance in identifying illegal workers. The federal budget has allocated $709,000 to continue the campaign during 1995-96. It is my personal belief that available jobs in our country must go to the people who are entitled to them.

I never cease to be amazed by the high level of unpaid work carried out every day in our communities by people who devote their time to caring for others. I offer them my heartfelt praise.

As well, from March 1996, eligibility for carer pension will be extended to include carers of people who, while they may not be pensioners themselves, are also not wealthy and hence cannot afford to pay for a carer. Up until now, only people who have been caring for a pensioner or beneficiary have been eligible for a carer pension.

         I ask: does the coalition really understand what being in government is about? It is not just a series of well laid out simple tasks. We operate in a fluid framework. We operate according to current social requirements and demands, but we do not take the easy and soft options mooted by the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) such as cutting taxes. Placed in the government's position, would the opposition have chosen cutbacks in services that help the poor while opposing tax rises that affect the rich? The short answer is that we do not know what the opposition would do. What do we use as a guide? Is it its proposal to cut $180,000 from the jobstart allowance by tightening the activity test and hence throwing thousands of people off onto welfare agencies, or is it its plan to reduce the age of a child for which a parent can be eligible for the sole parent pension depriving needy parents of that pension? Are comments from the coalition's industrial relations spokesman supporting harsh policies for workers that would leave them to fend for themselves an indication of coalition policies? We do not know.

         Certainly the overall development of Badgerys Creek site in 1986 following a very thorough study was entered into with a high degree of community involvement. This and the supplement to the draft environmental impact study was made publicly available in December of 1985 and had been the product of public consultation and involvement. As well, the final EIS was assessed by the relevant Commonwealth and state environmental agencies and endorsed by them as being adequate. I say: that was then and this is now—1995. That is why since my election to federal parliament in 1990 I have constantly urged our federal government to re-examine and update the issues outlined in the 1985 environment statement.

I therefore welcome the federal government's decision that additional environmental assessments be carried out to supplement the 1985 EIS for Badgery's Creek. I welcome the move that new environmental management plans are to be prepared for both the construction and operation of the new airport, at a cost of some $23 million.

          Planners must take account of the fact that people in suburbs near the new airport site purchased properties years ago, never contemplating that an airport might one day be built nearby. Many local residents years ago made a conscious choice to live in the quiet rural areas of my electorate. Others who have moved in there since the 1975 subdivision began would not have had the slightest inkling that an airport could be constructed in the area and that they would end up under a flight path. I strongly advocate a position where that choice is not taken away from those people. What is planned and built today must be able to take us well and truly through the 21st century.

         However, I again urge planners to think about the implications each time a heavily laden aircraft flies low over Sydney's most densely populated western region. They must give particular consideration to take-off and landing in the very early hours of the morning and the impact this will have on residents' lives. I wonder if the planners and experts realise the noise generated by aircraft landing or taking off at 2 a.m. or 3 a.m. That is what we now must as a government consider. All of these issues are further difficult issues to be faced by our government. I have full confidence that these issues will be faced and that this budget as outlined will certainly take us not only to an election but to the formulation of government in the 1996 period.

         —Mr Deputy Speaker, 34 years ago when I was born in Melbourne, Australia was a nation brimming with confidence. People like my parents were blessed with a faith in things as they were; in the institutions that nurtured and protected them. They were relaxed about the changes that were happening around them, happening at a pace to which they felt equal. Government at that time was behaving by and large sensibly. The tax rate for a family with two children living on the average wage was 15.8 per cent. Indeed, the income tax act was a sensible 385 pages long. Asia was just emerging from its colonial age and Singapore was two years old. That was the situation when I lay staring at the walls of that maternity ward. Now, as I utter my first few phrases in this parliament, things are vastly different.

         I invite you to look at Australia now. That same family pays not 15 per cent tax but 35 per cent. Every hour of every day our national debt grows by $3 million, illustrated again with this morning's announcement. Asia, in this borderless world, is for many of our citizens a terrifying thing. So on behalf of all Australians my age and younger I say to our government, our High Court, our trade unions, our academics, our bureaucrats, our business chiefs and the editors of our news media: look what you have done to our future. Look how you have feasted at our expense. I feel entitled to protest that, whereas my parents were taught to believe in things, I and my generation were instructed to martyr ourselves, to doubt and to evangelise a new creed of resentment and self-aggrandisement. We Australians are, as a result of that generational change, an increasingly enfeebled country.

         But, before considering at greater length the problems and predicaments of Australia, a member of this House must first see to the needs of his or her electorate and to the welfare and the prosperity of its constituents. Despite some radical boundary changes, Wentworth in 1990 has largely retained its postwar flavour. It encompasses great affluence. Australia's most expensive residential real estate lies within the boundaries of Wentworth. It also encompasses many examples of grinding poverty. It is blessed with a diversity and with great historical depth. History in all its forms exists in Wentworth, from the RSLs to the survivors of the Jewish Holocaust. Only 57 per cent of Wentworth's residents were born in Australia.

         Another aspect of Wentworth is its nurturing of what I call the old life and the new life without conflict occurring between the two. It always gives me great joy to see how the traditions of an old beach culture still flourish at that great institution, the Bondi Icebergs. Members of that club—men and, recently, women—are intensely proud of their history as well as being proud of their attitudes. May they ever flourish. Likewise at the top of Bondi, up from the beach, lies the home in New South Wales of orthodox Judaism, at the Yeshiva Centre in Flood street. There on a Saturday morning you can see the faithful on their way to worship, determined by their costume and by their practices to preserve a tradition that is many centuries old, older of course than the Icebergs but just as precious.

         Surrounding these two institutions that represent the old life exists the new Australia, the Australia of different lifestyle and of radical thought. Indeed, from Double Bay to Bondi Junction and down to Bondi Beach you can see change happening as fast as it happens anywhere else in the nation. These two Australias, the new and the old, coexist quite happily. It illustrates to me that we, the people of Wentworth, of whatever creed or background or culture or income, are not in as much conflict as our news media might suggest to us. The same can be said of the rest of Australia—that we have a decency that is not to be found in any other country on this planet. That said, it gives me cause for some shame and certainly anger to see how the synagogues and the Jewish schools of Wentworth require such enormous security measures, including even guards during school hours. Representing such a community requires of me a constant vigilance to see that this shame of racial or religious based attack is never ignored by government. But, equally, this issue requires from us in this House immense wisdom in pursuing effective measures.

         I know that to a very large extent those people who operate in what we refer to as the markets, tend to look at the bottom line of the budget. Let me say at the outset that I am not one of those people who have a fetish about budget deficits or budget surpluses. I have sufficient experience with government budgets of all persuasions and at all levels of government to know that a surplus or a deficit and the size of a surplus or a deficit are not necessarily matters of great significance or as great significance as they are sometimes accorded.

         For example, for this coming financial year, the surplus will be $718 million, according to the forecast in the budget papers. It was not so very long ago when the government was indicating that by 1996-97 we would expect to get the budget into a position where the deficit would be equal to about one per cent of GDP. Then, on the basis of additional estimates that were made and changes which occurred in the national economy and in Australia's relationship with other countries, it looked as though it would be possible to balance the budget by 1996-97. What the government has achieved is a surplus one year earlier. As I say, the surplus is in excess of $700 million.

         I know that comments have been made about the surplus. There have been references, for example, to what some people choose to call creative budgeting. I see nothing wrong with members of the opposition making claims of that kind. It is very likely that if we were in opposition we would be making similar observations. There have been references made, for example, to the sale of government assets and the fact that the sale of government assets then appears in the budget as a negative outlay. Some people have tried to make an issue of that.

         The fact that it accords with both IMF and United Nations standards indicates that, if the opposition were in government at present and if it were pursuing in a similar way the types of objectives which this government is pursuing and if it were constructing a budget on that basis, its budget would have been very similar to this government's budget. The opposition would have treated the sale of assets in precisely the same way. I will have more to say about that because I have some reservations about the structure of the budget, and I would like to make some comments about how I believe the structure of the budget could be improved.

         But there are other elements that the opposition refers to as creative budgeting—not only the sale of government assets but also the bringing forward of the repayment of loans by state governments. That has an impact on the bottom line of the budget. There is also the fact that governments in various ways are able to shift particular items out of the budget into, for example, government business enterprises or into authorities or agencies of various kinds.

         That does not necessarily imply, Mr Deputy Speaker, as you know, that those items of outlay disappear. It is just that they appear in a different guise. That contributes to the appearance of the bottom line and the general impression which the budget can provide. Another element of it is when governments require the government business enterprises to increase the size of the dividends which they pay to the government. So each of those has an impact on what we refer to as the bottom line of the budget.

         I think for three or four years since that time cumulative budget surpluses have amounted to something like $18 billion. That was the first time that any national government had been able to budget for a surplus since the Commonwealth of Australia commenced to exist. I think that proves, more than many of the other indicators could have, the extent to which a federal Labor government was determined to be fiscally responsible, was determined to be fiscally stringent and was determined to examine all of the elements of the budget to ensure that any unnecessary outlays, any unnecessary forms of expenditure, were taken from it.

         When the Treasurer (Mr Willis) introduced the budget, he made the point that budgeting for a surplus of $718 million represented a turnaround in the budget outcome of $12.9 billion, almost $13 billion, since last year. I have indicated that there are some elements of the budget which helped to explain that. But there was a net fiscal tightening involved in this year's budget of at least $3,000 million. That was not a matter that went unnoticed by the market and it was not a matter which the market failed to respond to favourably.

         It has also been recognised in the community that on the surface this year's budget will not be able to make any significant difference to the current account deficit. I am not the only observer who has commented over a number of years that the current account deficit is the single most important problem which this government faces. This year the total of that deficit will be in excess of $20,000 million, which means that the Australian community and the Australian economy are dependent upon the savings of other countries to that extent. If, instead of our borrowing funds of that order to finance our external imbalance, overseas investors had been investing in Australia in equity, then each year the current account deficit would be lower than it is.

         One of the main reasons why the current account deficit continues at such a high level is that successive current account deficits in the past have contributed towards that overseas indebtedness on the part of the whole Australian community to the extent at present of about $160,000 million. If that $160,000 million, for example, were borrowed at an average interest rate of 10 per cent, there would be a debt servicing charge against the national economy of $16 billion every year. That is precisely why we are in the present position.

         The surplus of over $700 million I referred to is also sometimes referred to as the headline budget.

         One particular matter of concern to me with the budget is that we persist with the construction of what is essentially a current budget; that is, almost a cash accounting budget, indicating total revenue which has been received and total outlays. The difference between those two totals is the resultant budget deficit or budget surplus. I believe it would be a more appropriate approach to budgeting generally if we were to have a current budget to deal with all of those current revenue and current outlay items, and a capital budget which would be concerned with the purchase and the disposal of assets and various types of investments which are undertaken by governments.

         One particular concern which members of the government, as well as perhaps members of the opposition, have expressed from time to time is that, while the public sector, because of its nature and special responsibilities, should be responsible to a very large extent for the provision of national capital investment, national capital infrastructure, there has been a significant deficiency in the extent to which all levels of government in Australia have responded to that special responsibility. For example, recent figures on the US economy indicate that public sector investment over recent years has been negative; that is, the US government has either disposed of assets or allowed assets to run down to a greater extent than the new investment being undertaken in national infrastructure.

         When that happens, I believe the indications are serious indeed.

         In the budget papers we do distinguish between aggregates for current items and capital items, but we do not distinguish between a current budget and a capital budget, as I believe we should. Another disadvantage of our failure to do that is that new investment—which should not be seen as a profligate financial exercise being undertaken by government—is seen as a charge against current revenue instead of being seen, as I believe it should be, as a charge against the continuing flow of income which it will generate into the future.

         As a result of including capital investment in what is essentially a current budget, the budget deficit appears to be increased. That often serves the purpose of giving a very wrong impression to those people who observe our budget and who seek to make something not only of the structure of the budget but of the government's intentions in relation to it. I believe it would be a very useful innovation for us to introduce that change.

         As I said, within the budget papers at present there is a distinction made and it is possible to extract some of that information. But, for example, if you were to extract those capital items from the end of the Second World War until about the mid-1980s, then for most of those years there was no deficit at all—in fact, a surplus—despite the fact that during all of that time the budget had as its bottom line a deficit. The overall surplus during the four years towards the end of the 1980s became much more significant. I have already made reference to the fact that, during those four years when we budgeted for a surplus and achieved a surplus, we had a cumulative aggregate of those surpluses of about $18,000 million.

If I could go back to the mid-1980s, in 1984-85, for example, there was a slight current deficit of $1 billion; in 1985-86 it was balanced; in 1986-87 there was a large surplus; and those large surpluses continued through until 1990-91. By the time we got to 1992-93, the current deficit was $10 billion, but the total deficit was $14.6 billion.

         By failing to separate out current items from capital items, the wrong impression is given. I know that the difference was only $4.6 billion, but that $4.6 billion did not represent current expenditure by the government; it represented capital investment by the government in the process of building that infrastructure. In 1993-94 there was practically no new capital investment, and the same was the case in 1994-95. This year the amount of capital investment is minimal when compared with the total in the current budget. I would appeal for that distinction to be made between current and capital items.

         —I rise to speak on the 1995-96 budget, the final instalment in Labor's betrayal of the Australian people. This is another classic Keating budget—more spending, more fiddles, more promises of economic nirvana and more taxes. The appropriation bills for 1995-96 have three components. Appropriation Bill (No. 1) deals with funding for the Commonwealth's programs. This bill will appropriate $31.7 billion for spending on annual programs. Appropriation Bill (No. 2) deals with funding for payments to the states and capital works. The bill authorises funding of $4.3 billion. Finally, there is the Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill 1995-96, which will authorise funding for the running of Parliament House. This bill will appropriate $144.5 million.

But, as we expected, this government has shown itself to be once again not up to the task. Once again, this budget is all about rhetoric and not about action. Once again, this budget is about gimmicks and not about action. Once again, this budget is about the Prime Minister continuing his strategy of fraud with the Australian people.

         This country has a significant foreign debt problem. The government realises this but refuses to do anything about it. It has forecast a current account deficit of $27 billion for this year and next. The forecast deficits are unacceptably high and simply continue feeding into the ever growing mountain of foreign debt which will be the legacy of this Labor government. What we need is a strong and sustained lift in savings, both public and private. The most effective way for the government to assist in this task is to structurally reduce the budget deficit.

         What is the government's solution? To bring down a gimmick budget to get it past the next election. Responsible economic management is the last thing on Paul Keating's mind. Although the Treasurer (Mr Willis) was allowed to introduce the budget, this budget has `Paul Keating' written all over it. There was the massaging of market expectations, saying that a surplus was too big an ask, there was the leaking of proposals to see what people thought; and then on budget night, lo and behold, there was a small surplus—another rabbit out of the hat.

         But it is a hollow surplus, and everyone in this parliament, including the Prime Minister, knows it. In fact, tucked away in the back of the budget papers, the ABS tells us the real story: it is a deficit of $8.2 billion. That is because one of the main components of the government's so-called surplus is over $5.3 billion worth of asset sales. Having already taxed as much as it could in one budget, the government was so woefully short of a respectable number that it reached for asset sales. This is a perennial measure for Labor, trying to improve the figures.

         Given that items such as ANL and Qantas have been there for years, it does not actually intend selling very much, but it put it in there anyway. In fact, the record speaks for itself. Since 1990-91, the government has forecast asset sales of $8,075 million. The government has actually sold only $3,789 million worth of assets. After selling only $3.8 billion over the last four years, the government is trying to tell us that it will sell or achieve $5.3 billion this year. Who is the government trying to kid? It will not make the target, and it damn well knows it.

Even if the government does manage to sell anything, it will still not make any difference to national savings. All it does is to substitute public savings for private savings.

In 1995-96 outlays increased by 1.7 per cent in real terms, or $6.6 billion. After all the talk of calling back ministers to put them through the ERC again, this government increased spending by 1.7 per cent in real terms in 1995-96. After three years of growth, with particularly strong growth in 1994, this is all the government is still up to: spending.

There is a range of measures for the family costing $93 million in 1995-96 and $747 million over four years.

         Both ordinary Australians and corporate Australia have been reminded of the flexibility of Keating tax promises. In 1993 a lower corporate tax rate was something about which Paul Keating frequently boasted. It was a key plank in making Australia more competitive and assisting in making us a centre for regional headquarters. Two years later, international competitiveness seems to be less important. The corporate tax rate has gone from 33 per cent to 36 per cent. The argument runs that companies are making good profits and Australia is a low tax country so we can lift company tax. In the first instance, it is profits which provide companies with the capacity to invest, grow and employ. When we have about 750,000 people unemployed, I personally do not think we should be reducing the capacity of companies to grow.

When we add in the new company tax hike, the lift in indirect taxes and the employee superannuation, we climb even higher in the tax stakes.

Saunders met with only 35 Aboriginal women opposed to the bridge, making no attempt to speak to the hundreds of Ngarrindjeri women in the lower Murray region. No attempt was made to go to Point McLeay and she did not go and see Nana Laura Kartinyeri, Queen of the Ngarrindjeri.

In 1970, Mr Lloyd Hirst purchased a manually operated masonry brick-block making machine capable of making 4,500 blocks per day. Ten years later, to make the production cost effective, Mr Hirst and his staff had upgraded the same machine to produce 60 bricks per minute or 25,200 bricks for a seven-hour day.

         In the early 1980s, due to deregulation of the transport industry by the government—a Labor government, I might add—Boulder Brick and Tile established an export market in Perth and obtained several large contracts some 600 kilometres from Kalgoorlie-Boulder.

         Some 12 months later, Boulder Brick and Tile was $100,000 short to finish the expansion and applied to the CDB, the Commonwealth Development Bank, for funding. `Whilst the application was proceeding', Mr Hirst said, `we became $50,000 in arrears on the existing loans.' Without rejecting the loan application, and without discussion with the principal director and guarantor, the CDB issued a demand for payment of some $380,000 by 4.30 p.m. the following day.

I actually took this up with the development bank at the time because I thought its actions were extremely precipitous and it just would not listen to reason. Here was a man with assets of over $2 million. He got into arrears of some $30,000 through, in fact, an oversight, offered to make it up immediately, but was rejected by the bank.

         —I rise this evening to remind the House of the continuing disaster that is occurring in Bosnia-Herzegovina. I refer, in particular, to the failure of the United Nations, the European Community and all those recognised Western powers, as they are often referred to in the newspapers and other media, to deal with a situation that is quite clearly similar to those throughout its unfortunate recent history. On 6 February this year I moved a motion on this subject which states:

        Today we see in our newspapers and in the electronic media the unfortunate situation where 250 UN peacekeepers are being held and used as hostages by the Bosnian Serb forces.

         The irony is that the very people who have been sent to keep the peace now find themselves in extreme danger. As we have seen in more recent times, the government of France, in particular through President Chirac, has threatened to withdraw its forces from Bosnia-Herzegovina if there is no action to try to beef up the peacekeeping resources and forces in Bosnia-Herzegovina in the face of this quite outrageous behaviour by the Bosnian Serb forces. I visited Sarajevo in 1992 and 1993. In both cases, I was able to see the enormously dangerous conditions the French, British, some New Zealanders and other peacekeepers were working under in that city and elsewhere. It was certainly dangerous to visit places like Bihac and Tuzla.

         In relation to Croatia, and formerly Slovenia, we have seen from 1991—1992 in the case of Bosnia-Herzegovina—the same systematic method of operation used by the aggressors in all cases. The seizure of UN peacekeepers and their use as hostages is the most recent example of a very consistent pattern of aggressive behaviour that the west, the United Nations and the European Community ought to have recognised from the word go. A number of us have consistently made speeches in this place calling for a resolute response to this type of aggression and this type of behaviour. We believe from the word go that bullying had to be met with either force or resolute behaviour by those who had the responsibility for negotiating peace or any form of settlement.

         In the final analysis, nothing has changed since February when the motion was moved by the member for Fowler (Mr Grace) and me. It is quite clear that we must lift the sanctions on arms supplies to the armed forces of the government of Bosnia-Herzegovina, so that, in the absence of any resolute action by the peacekeepers, at least that government will be in a position to bring stability to the situation and to match this naked aggression and terrorism that has been launched on the people of Bosnia-Herzegovina by the Bosnian Serbs.

         In his column, Mr Priest said that two-thirds of Australia's 1.64 million aged pensioners—the majority of whom are older women who have few resources and who are likely to be hardest hit by fees and charges—live on incomes of less than $200 a week. Many have only modest savings, and Mr Priest claims—with good cause—that they are being victimised.

         Mr Priest raised a number of other issues in the context of the Prices Surveillance Authority inquiry into bank charges.

An example of this is the increasing use of automatic teller machines.

         In the course of the public debate on the fairness, or otherwise, of bank fees and charges, a number of arguments have emerged, some of which I would like to address here this evening. One of the most extraordinary claims to come out of this debate—and I am disappointed to note that the claim is supported by the opposition spokesperson on finance, the member for Forrest (Mr Prosser)—is that banks do not have a social responsibility to small customers. Some recent media reports have included the following claims: banks are not obliged to subsidise the poor; banks do not really want poor pensioners at all; banks have no social responsibility beyond providing standard banking services; small customers are uneconomic customers; banks have a social responsibility only to shareholders and owners; and banks have no obligation to develop a social conscience or to hand out charity.

         Clearly, banks and other financial institutions do have a crucial role to play in our community. The Australian Banking Association has said that Australia could not function without a banking system, and that is self-evident. The ABA has also said that banks provide a safe haven for depositors. I agree that banks are essential and should provide a safe haven for those who desire it. But judging from the spiralling imposts on small savers, it would appear that this is no longer the case for many in our community who are being deliberately priced out of the bank system.

         In undertaking its inquiry on banking and deregulation in 1991, the Martin report sought to provide a definition of a bank. The following definitions may be useful in considering some of the current issues. One definition says that they are for accepting deposits and making loans—the basic banking responsibility. The committee report also said that they are for:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        the collection of money by receiving deposits upon loan . . . and the utilisation of the money so collected by lending it. . . These are the essential functions of a bank as an instrument of society.

         In undertaking this role, the banks provide financial services to the community. They are major employers. Through their extensive branch networks, they provide daily access for the community to the payment system. They participate in providing housing to the community. And they play an important role in developing Australia's economy. In short, banks are a part of our society and they do have social responsibility—and to suggest otherwise is scandalous.

        And on it went. The point is that this radio program is designed to appeal to the young and subteenagers. The prime listening audience of this particular radio station is aimed at seven- to 19-year-olds. When you have students who have these sorts of difficulties at our state high schools, whether it is intended as a joke or not—and the station management has said to my representations to the Australian Broadcasting Authority that it was a joke—that sort of advice should not be tendered by two intellectual degenerates like Krusty and Rachael.

         One would think that the prime object of anybody who has the public trust of a broadcasting licence is to make sure that standards are met, that we do not have a situation where our community standards are flouted and where the discipline of a high school—which is obviously under some strain anyway—is undermined by the likes of these two creatures going on air and broadcasting rubbish like that. I am not totally satisfied with the response of B105 to the Broadcasting Tribunal, or the Broadcasting Authority as it is now. I think it was the Wednesday night when that broadcast went to air, but I note that on the Friday night they were still making references to the phone call. I think that, in itself, is absolutely crazy: that you have two so-called radio personalities promoting stalking, destruction, damage and, in fact, physical assault.

         The Broadcasting Authority obviously will have a time to review the licence of B105. B105 says in its letter to the Broadcasting Authority that in future that program will be taped and the focus will be more on commonplace humour and not on some of this offbeat humour. If this offbeat humour is designed to appeal to our teenagers, then all I can say is that we have a very sick society and we have a very sick broadcasting industry. Quite frankly, I think B105 and the two personalities involved should be condemned. I very much look forward to receiving from the minister the response to my further representations on the attitude of B105.

         —A number of local government councils in New South Wales are currently increasing their mayoral and councillors' allowances as provided for by a recent decision of the New South Wales Remuneration Tribunal. This follows changes to the New South Wales Local Government Act. My old council, Campbelltown City Council, has just decided to increase its mayoral allowance to $30,000 a year and the councillors' allowance from the current $5,000 to $12,500 a year. Of course, when I was on the council just over two years ago we got only $3,000 a year. So I think this rise is entirely justified and long overdue in recognition of the time and effort put in by local councillors.

         Next door to my electorate, the Camden council has increased its mayoral allowance to $20,000 a year and the councillors' allowance to $9,000 a year. As Camden is nowhere near as big as Campbelltown, it perhaps felt that this was all it could justify. But it is interesting to look at the reaction of some of the Campbelltown councillors who voted against the increase. Of course, this is a council election year in New South Wales and the usual petty opportunists on Campbelltown council, led by Councillor Jim Kremmer, are trying to use these rises as the basis of an election stunt.

         Councillor Kremmer criticised the rises in allowances as a `greedy, money-grabbing exercise', while his running mate Councillor Ron Owers made it clear that he would make this a `hot election issue'. This is the same Councillor Kremmer who, in September 1990, when he was the Labor mayor, demanded that the Labor caucus, of which I was a member, vote to increase his mayoral allowance by 75 per cent to $35,000 a year. Let me make it clear that I supported the rise in the mayoral allowance at the time because I believed then, and I still believe, that mayors and councillors are underpaid for the hours and the work expected of them.

         The Labor caucus did unanimously support the rise in Councillor Kremmer's allowance. But Councillor Kremmer made it clear that he intended to use the money to fund his re-election campaign, which of course he was legally entitled to do. But Councillor Kremmer, after he took the money, resigned from the Labor Party and stood firstly as an Independent candidate for the seat of Moorebank in the 1991 state election. Councillor Kremmer directed his preferences to the Liberal Party in that election, after his close friend and associate Mr Michael Knight had failed to gain Labor preselection for Moorebank. Councillor Kremmer then led an Independent ticket for the 1991 council election, getting himself and Ron Owers elected at the expense of the Labor Party's candidates.

         This was the beginning of a very strange period in politics around Campbelltown, with some ALP members clearly supporting Councillor Kremmer at the expense of the ALP ticket. So Councillor Kremmer had got the Labor caucus to increase his mayoral allowance, pocketed the money for his election campaign and then left the party to run as an Independent in both state and council elections. Meanwhile, the Labor caucus was left wearing the political flak for having increased the allowance. Labor lost control of the council at the election, losing three seats.

         The incoming council in 1991 reduced the mayoral allowance back to its previous level of around $20,000. Now, in another council election year, Councillor Kremmer and Councillor Owers—ever the grubby opportunists—have the gall and the absolute hypocrisy to come out attacking the council for increasing both the mayoral and the councillors' allowances as provided for under the new Local Government Act. Nobody should be fooled for one minute by this cynical stunt; this hypocritical nonsense.

         One thing is quite clear: Councillor Kremmer, who still of course has close contact with some people in the Labor Party, will again be running for council and he clearly will not need his councillor's allowance to fund his election campaign this time. He will no doubt have lots of friends and lots of support from companies like Monarch Developments, which recently had a major development application approved. He also has many other friends who will support his campaign—lots of friends indeed. But these rises in remuneration for councillors and mayors in New South Wales are long overdue and I thoroughly agree with them.

The Government recognises the benefits of the proximity of Western Australia to Asian markets and has ensured the closer involvement of Western Australia in a number of the Department's programs and activities, for example, last year's major Australia Today Indonesia promotion, the National Trade Strategy Consultative Process, the Market Australia Campaign to commence shortly in a number of Asian markets and the recently announced Indian Ocean Regional Initiative.

        (2) The Australian Postal Corporation Act 1989 was amended last year to allow for Regulations to be made to prescribe performance standards in relation to such things as the frequency of mail delivery services. As was indicated in the Second Reading Speech to the amendments, the need for Regulations will be considered after a review of Australia Post's community service obligations by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure. I have issued terms of reference to the Committee, which advertised the inquiry and called for submissions in national press on 8 April 1995.
