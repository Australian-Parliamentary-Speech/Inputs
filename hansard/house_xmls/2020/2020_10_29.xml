                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2006, about 560,000 residents did not speak English well or at all. By 2016, at the last census, it was 820,000.</span>

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is designed to support migrants to increase their English language proficiency. It contains four key measures, which I will discuss in greater detail. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The first measure is to remove the current 510-hour limit on free English tuition that a migrant is entitled to under the Adult Migrant English Program (the AMEP).</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Learning a new language is complex and takes time. The number of hours of tuition required by each individual varies based on many factors, including age, prior education and the linguistic distance of their first language from English. Research shows that 510 hours is not a realistic time frame for most migrants to reach even a functional level of English. This amendment will ensure that migrants participating in the AMEP have the opportunity to continue to undertake free English tuition until they reach a vocational level of proficiency in English—that is, that they will be able to do as many hours as they need of free English language classes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second measure is to extend the upper limit for eligibility to access the AMEP from functional English to vocational English.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The AMEP currently provides free English tuition for migrants up to the level of functional English. This is lower than the level of English required by most employers, and for entry to most TAFE courses. By raising the upper limit to vocational English, the government will be ensuring that migrants have the opportunity to study English for longer and reach a higher level of proficiency. This will enhance migrants' prospects for further education and future employment, as well as support their full participation in the Australian community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The third measure is to remove the time limits on enrolment, commencement and completion of English tuition for certain visa holders.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This amendment will remove disincentives to participation in English language studies, by allowing certain visa holders with low levels of English proficiency who are in, or have already entered Australia, the opportunity to re-engage in language learning. This recognises that migrants often have a number of competing settlement priorities when they first arrive in Australia, including work, accommodation and family commitments. This amendment will provide a strong message regarding the importance of learning the national language, and the level of support that the government is committed to provide to do this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, the fourth measure is to provide the discretion for English courses to be delivered to people who are outside Australia and who have applied for or been granted a permanent visa, or a specified temporary visa.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Currently, this discretion only applies to people outside Australia who have applied for a permanent visa. It does not include people who have been granted a permanent visa, or persons who have applied for or been granted a temporary visa.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This amendment will ensure that tuition options can be developed in the future for the delivery of English courses to people who are overseas, including after their visas have been granted, in preparation for their migration to Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, this bill makes a number of important amendments that will better support migrants in their efforts to learn English, and contribute to enhanced social cohesion within the Australian community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill makes minor but necessary changes to the Health Insurance Act 1973 to make clearer current arrangements for recovery of Medicare payments owed to the Commonwealth.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill corrects a possible misunderstanding about the operation of the act. Medicare benefits are recoverable if incorrect information provided in connection with a claim leads to an overpayment, even if the information was not intentionally incorrect.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will also provide government the flexibility to adapt to changes in the way Medicare claims might be made in the future. It is worth recalling that the provisions for recovery of amounts overpaid were first enacted more than three decades ago, that is—in digital technology time frames, at least—eons ago.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Technological advances in Medicare claiming may be easily accommodated because of the stipulation that it is the giving of information, regardless of its form, rather than the making of a statement that will be the basis for a claim for Medicare payments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Critically, these amendments will help protect the integrity and financial viability of the Medicare program that each year provides for hundreds of millions of services through billions of dollars in benefits. In 2018-19, for example, there were 424 million Medicare services, with benefits totalling $24 billion. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The vast majority of practitioners do the right thing—only a small proportion of Medicare services are claimed incorrectly, but given the quantum of money involved they comprise significant recoverable amounts nevertheless. These amendments will ensure that the Commonwealth may continue to recover overpayments and continue to protect Australia's universal healthcare system. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Medicare program gives Australians access to world-class and affordable health care by providing benefits or rebates for around 6,000 services, each with its own item number, listed on the Medicare Benefits Schedule. The schedule's services are specified in regulations, which require that practitioners fulfil the criteria described in items before Medicare benefits are payable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Subsection 129AC(1) of the Health Insurance Act 1973<span style="font-style:italic;"></span>enables the Commonwealth to recover amounts overpaid for incorrectly claimed Medicare benefits or payments where a false or misleading statement has led to a payment that should not have been made. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments to subsection 129AC(1) will clarify for practitioners its intended operation—that is, that the Commonwealth can seek to recover Medicare benefits and payments because of false or misleading information provided in relation to a claim, whether or not the information was intentionally incorrect. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the amendments, it is immaterial whether the false or misleading information is given: </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This will ensure recoveries are possible where claims have been made through digital claiming channels. Currently, no amounts can be recovered from a person under section 129AC(1) unless the Commonwealth has given the person a clear, written explanation of its decision to recover the amount. This bill retains these protections, ensuring that anyone who may be found to have received recoverable amounts has the opportunity to understand the reason for the decision and to submit evidence and has the right to a formal review under legislation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These changes do not impose additional requirements upon practitioners. Practitioners are currently responsible for ensuring that all claims they make are accurate and correct. This will not alter, and, critically, no patients will be affected by these amendments. The bill retains the provision that overpayments are recovered from the person who was responsible for the false or misleading information, even if the Medicare benefit was paid to the patient or another third party.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments will apply retrospectively, to ensure that any incorrect claims or payments made prior to the passage of this bill may be recovered. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments do not change the lawful basis for which Medicare benefits or payments are payable and, as such, do not affect a person's existing rights. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hume</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:43</span>):  by leave—Today I rise to address the House on the Australian government's comprehensive plan to drive down energy prices for all Australians as we reduce emissions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On this side of the House, we understand that it is access to low-cost energy that underpins the economic security of all Australians, because our energy sector not only is a critical export for Australia but underpins our domestic competitiveness—competitiveness in areas like manufacturing that supports 850,000 jobs in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For every petajoule of energy that we consume domestically, we generate over $300 million in GDP. Energy should be plentiful, it should be reliable and, most of all, it should be affordable. It is the foundation upon which this great country has been built. Affordable, reliable energy provides employment and opportunity across all sectors and regions—for tradies, farmers, hospitality workers and manufacturing workers, among others. As we make our way out of the crisis, access to affordable, reliable energy will fuel our industries, create jobs and relieve the financial pressure on families.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a comprehensive plan for recovery, reform and resilience—a plan that will give rise to the next chapter in our national story; a plan that focuses on technology, not taxes; a plan that enables choice for consumers, not constraints; a plan that only a Liberal-National government is capable of delivering.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia was, is and always will be an energy superpower; it is who we are and what we do. We are blessed with abundant natural resources. Coal, derided by many of those opposite, has provided generations of Australian workers with a good income and a comfortable home. To this day, it is the lifeblood of towns throughout rural and regional Australia. It has powered our industries and lifted millions of men, women and children out of absolute poverty.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are one of the largest exporters of gas in the world, and an important and trusted supplier of uranium. The royalties and taxes they have provided have built our school and roads, trained our doctors and nurses, and helped protect our borders.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are opening up new opportunities such as hydrogen, and cementing Australia's position as a world leader in renewables. We are seeing record investment in renewables, with an incredible 6.3 gigawatts of renewables capacity delivered in 2019—a number that looks set to be repeated this year. Thirty billion dollars has been invested in the sector since 2017. According to the Clean Energy Regulator, Australia is investing roughly 10 times the average of industrial countries and four or five times the next highest level of investment. This is an extraordinary outcome.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite talk Australia down. Arguing that investment has fallen is ill-informed and misleading. They seek to talk down Australia's renewables achievements. As the CER itself has stated, this story of the collapse in renewables has been around for a couple of years. But, in our view, it is not true. While the government is getting on with implementing our energy plan, the Leader of the Opposition peddles falsehoods.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're delivering a record level of investment in wind and solar, which is creating benefits as well as challenges. We must back it up. That's why we're building the largest pumped hydro project in the Southern Hemisphere.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is this government that committed to and commissioned Snowy 2.0, it is this government that established a $1 billion Grid Reliability Fund and it is this government that is fast-tracking every major priority transmission project in AEMO's integrated system plan.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We must have a realistic policy framework that enables us to deliver the energy that Australians want. I am pleased that this side of the House has been clear and consistent in our energy plan—a plan that we have been implementing and a plan that has been working.</span>
              </p>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am happy to report that prices have been coming down for some time. The most recent CPI energy figures show more reductions in energy prices. We have now seen seven straight quarters of CPI electricity price reductions compared to the corresponding quarter of the previous year. We have now had 13 straight months of wholesale electricity price reductions, and I am confident that will soon be 14. Prices have fallen by up to 48 per cent over this time across the National Electricity Market and are now at levels that have not been seen since 2014.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's no coincidence that those 13 months follow the government's introduction of the big-stick legislation. Legislation that has brought important accountability into the energy market, a market that continues to be dominated by a small number of players. The reforms we have delivered—like abolishing the loyalty tax through our default market offer and taking action on sneaky late payment fees—are delivering real savings for consumers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But reform to the market is not the only thing that this government has achieved. It was this government that had the courage to put customers first. It was this government that doesn't shy away from the hard decisions that will protect Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Nowhere is this better seen than in our response to the Liddell task force. The modelling through that task force was clear. If Liddell isn't replaced with dispatchable capacity, then prices rise. We have seen this in the closure of the Northern Power Station in South Australia. We have seen it with the closure of Hazelwood in Victoria. When this happens, it is the consumer who loses and the vested interests win.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We as a government will not let that happen. That would be a sledgehammer to industry. It would drive price hikes not seen since the introduction of the carbon tax. This government considered this problem—the Liddell issue—in detail and we have taken a principled approach. We did the work and we've set the clear target for 1,000 megawatts for the private sector and if they step up, we'll step back. Ultimately this is the private sector's responsibility, and we will only step up if the private sector steps back. I welcome the strong support from local members on our plan—including from those opposite.</span>

Transmission projects are complex and difficult to get started; however, there are strong business cases amongst the projects we see. That is why we have invested over $300 million in early works for interconnection and over $117 million in microgrids. We have already invested in 18 microgrid projects across 70 regional communities and we will invest in many more through a refunded ARENA.</span>

When leave is granted, leave is automatically granted to the opposition—either to the Leader of the Opposition or the relevant shadow minister.

There is no flexibility, tolerance or capacity to talk about anything other than that. I'm just pointing that out to the minister and to the House for all future ministerial statements. That is, you can't talk about the opposition or anything else. It is a ministerial statement; it is not a political statement. That is really all I need to say. It's outlined very clearly and very concisely in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Practice</span>. As I think you pointed out, there are three references to it.

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HWK" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BUTLER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hindmarsh</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Manager of Opposition Business</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:05</span>):  We've had to wait until this minister's third year for him to make a statement, and all the statement confirmed was, firstly, how utterly bare this government's cupboard is of energy policy and, secondly, everyone's suspicion, already pretty well founded, that this minister is without a doubt the worst energy minister in living memory. I've been in this portfolio for several years, and I've worked with his predecessors, Ian Macfarlane, now at the QRC, and the now Treasurer. These were people with whom I regularly disagreed on policy but people—Ian and the Treasurer—who were well renowned for being able to work across the aisle in the national interest. I did that with both of them in a constructive way, but this minister, according to all reports, finds it difficult even to work with his own colleagues, let alone work across the aisle. At the end of the day it reflects pretty poorly on this Prime Minister that he decided, after the election particularly, after the hullabaloo of the coup against Malcolm Turnbull was all over, to keep this minister in this portfolio. We've got an incompetent ideologue, weighed down by a seemingly endless litany of scandals, in this portfolio at a time of the biggest transformation in the global energy sector in living memory.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the minister's third year in his job, and he's delivered just two things. He told us today he's delivered the Grid Reliability Fund, but we haven't even begun debate on that legislation in this House. He told us he's delivered the refunding of ARENA, and we thank him for that, though it's a body that this government spent years and years trying to abolish. He tells us that he's delivered an integrated system plan, a plan he described a couple of weeks ago as 'transmission lines to nowhere'. In truth, the only two things this minister has delivered are a grant of almost $9 million to the operator of the Vales Point coal-fired power station and a grant of almost $4 million to Shine Energy, a company that's never delivered any project whatsoever and a grant which has been referred to and is being investigated by the Auditor-General—a grant that was announced before the department had even bothered to ask this company to apply for a grant to be able to conduct its own feasibility study into its own project.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, to be fair to this minister, he never claimed to have any ambition to achieve anything positive in this sector. This minister was elected on a platform of stopping stuff, and he spent all his time as a backbencher advocating the stopping of stuff. This minister only believes in one thing in the energy portfolio, and that is to stop the expansion of renewable energy. This minister, before he was elected and as a backbencher, was, as we all know, the poster child of Alan Jones's anti-windfarm rallies, and later on, along with Tony Abbott, the member for Hughes, the member for New England and a whole bunch of other fellow members of that clique within the coalition party room, he ambushed the then Prime Minister, the then Treasurer—now Prime Minister—and the then energy minister—now Treasurer—and killed off the National Energy Guarantee. This was a policy that had been sought by this government, recommended to this government and supported by every single state government in the country, Labor and Liberal alike. It was supported by every business group and described by the now Prime Minister as the policy which had the greatest level of consensus he had ever seen in his time in the parliament. It was a policy which the now Prime Minister and the now Treasurer said would save households $550, but because it countenanced the expansion of some renewable energy it was ambushed and killed off by this minister when he was a junior.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, they got their wish. The NEG is gone—the last chance of an enduring bipartisan energy policy coming out of this parliament for the benefit of the nation. They got their wish. But, like the dog that finally caught the car, this minister has had no idea what to do next. His first obligation, of course, was to report back to his mentor, Alan Jones. He did that within a couple of days of being appointed minister for energy, and he reiterated to Alan his absolute commitment to stopping more solar and wind. He said to Alan, 'There's too much solar and wind in this system,' and under him there would be no more. Of course, investor confidence collapsed, but that didn't bother the minister, because he said, 'A government should not even try to boost investor confidence.' God forbid that would be the role of a government in a mixed private-public economy. His plan, instead, was to set up a policy, which he gives the fancy name 'Underwriting New Generation Investments'—a policy he didn't refer much to in his statement—to be able to pick his own pet projects. There were no guidelines, there was no transparency, and, as has been pointed out by a number of these operators, there was no actual delivery, except for a grant, as I said, to the Vales Point coal-fired power station. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In spite of the minister's best efforts to abolish Renewable Energy Target, along with those fellow travellers several years ago, there was a final burst of investment in renewable energy over the last several years as the Renewable Energy Target legislation tapered off. But there is a clear policy vacuum for investors, a policy vacuum business groups, and obviously the industry, complain about regularly. Even worse than a vacuum, they have a situation where there's no investment framework coming out of this parliament and a policy that says that, at any moment, this minister will issue a media release saying that he intends to put taxpayer funds behind one of his pet projects, which might end up competing with a private investment. In contrast to what the minister said, after the Renewable Energy Target tapered off last year, the Reserve Bank made it clear that investment had collapsed by 50 per cent. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This minister talks about installations. Of course installations were still going strongly last year. They are a lagging indicator of financial decisions made two years earlier. The Reserve Bank and the industry itself said that investment decisions have collapsed, because after the Renewable Energy Target was completed there was an utter policy vacuum. This minister might try to pretend otherwise. The Reserve Bank of Australia made that point last year before COVID-19. The University of Technology Sydney has said that, because of that policy vacuum, 11,000 jobs in the renewable energy sector will be lost over the coming two years because of the lack of an investment framework. At a time when we need the creation of new jobs, in a sector that, around the world, is seeing investments created by the hundreds and hundreds of thousands, jobs are going backwards under this minister because of his ideology. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To cover up this abysmal lack of delivery, a few weeks ago we saw a week of announcements. This Prime Minister is good at announcements. He is very, very good at announcements. One of them was the Technology Investment Roadmap—a document that included some good things. It included, for example, a focus on hydrogen. We had a hydrogen policy last year at the election; the government then described hydrogen as snake oil. We're glad to see that they have changed their view about that. Hydrogen is something that I think this parliament as a whole can get behind. But there were some inexplicable details in this technology road map. Bioenergy: where members talk so much about regional Australia, you'd think this would be an area they would support strongly. Bioenergy was utterly missing from this technology road map, but of course nuclear energy was in. Bioenergy out, nuclear energy in. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Energy efficiency was described as an emerging technology. The International Energy Agency describes it as the first fuel. Around the world we see energy efficiency as the best way of driving down power bills and energy bills more generally, the best way of creating new jobs. We see this in the UK, in other parts of Europe, in the United States and, increasingly, in developing countries like China. But, for this minister, energy efficiency, in one of the most energy-inefficient economies in the world, is just an emerging technology. Of course, after their ridiculous, hysterical campaign last year, electric vehicles simply warrant a watching brief. We'll just watch what's happening all around the world. In this document there are no timetables; no milestones; and some really weird, inexplicable detail. It is all announcement, no delivery.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The centrepiece of this government's economic recovery strategy—the so-called gas-fired recovery—was hyped up over several months, puffed up over several months. When the document finally came out, it was full of spin and was light as a feather on substance. First of all, this gas-fired recovery document that was released by the government does absolutely nothing to resolve the crisis that has emerged under this government and been in place for years. It talks about spot prices and contract prices during the COVID pandemic. The prices paid by Australian manufacturers have tripled under this government. According to the ACCC, companies have closed under this government because of the gas prices. Contract prices have not come down. They are still at three times their historical prices, threatening the viability of thousands of manufacturing jobs, and this announcement did nothing to resolve it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed we've heard this week, with the release of a discussion paper that deals with the export controls that we have been advocating for for years to back the interests of Australian manufacturers and Australian households and see less of our gas shipped overseas so that it's reliably and affordably supplied to Australian users, already they are crab walking away from that. That's what we read in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Financial Review</span>—they are backing the big gas companies again over the interests of Australian manufacturers, Australian workers and Australian households. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The most extraordinary thing about this gas-fired recovery announcement is you cannot point to a single job that will be created in the time frame we require—the next year or two. There's not a single job that you can point to in that document. Not only does the so-called gas-fired recovery fail to deliver any recovery; it is completely out of touch with the clear message being given by all business groups, investors, lenders and central banks here in Australia and all around the world, and that is that economic recovery pathways out of this COVID pandemic and the recessions that are being driven by the pandemic should be paved with clean energy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Business Council, the Australian Industry Group, the big banks, the big insurers and the super funds here in Australia have all said the economic recovery pathway must be aligned with a national commitment to net zero emissions by 2050. It's just the smart thing to do. Two big challenges facing our nation should be dealt with together. You can deal with them together because paving the pathway out of this recession with clean energy is the smartest way to create jobs. In contrast to the gas-fired recovery that delivers not a single job, the Clean Energy Council makes it clear that renewable energy projects that already have planning approval and would be ready to go and ready to be built if they had an investment framework that would accommodate them are ready to create 50,000 real jobs now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, of course, this government won't commitment to net zero emissions by 2050, because the only thing this minister hates more than renewable energy is climate action. He described climate change in this House as:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The new climate religion … has little basis on fact and everything to do with blind faith.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, he was making it very clear where he stands on this seismic challenge to Australia. So, even though net zero emissions by 2050 is required by the Paris Agreement, which this government signed Australia up to, even though it's required and dictated by all scientific advice about what we need to do for the interests of future generations, even though it's supported and committed to by all state governments—Labor and Liberal alike—federal Labor, every business group, the biggest mining company, the biggest bank, the biggest telecommunications provider and all of the big insurers and investors in this country, even though CSIRO modelling used all the time by the New South Wales Liberal government shows that net zero emissions by 2050 will deliver higher wages, stronger economic growth and lower power bills, that's not good enough for this minister and this Prime Minister.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The performance of this government on climate change is abysmal. The Climate Change Performance Index, which ranks the biggest 56 producers of greenhouse gases in the world, consistently ranks Australia under this Liberal government outside the top 50. It can't even make the top 50 of 56. That plummeted obviously under Tony Abbott when he was Prime Minister, but it hasn't recovered under either Prime Minister Turnbull or the current Prime Minister because, although the marketing and spin might have changed, this government has kept the business model of Tony Abbott. It's absolutely kept true to it. There is no better evidence of that than the fact that this minister holds this portfolio.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also see its failure in the emissions data that the government itself publishes. The latest data was published only a few months ago in August. What it shows is this: in the six-year period of the last Labor government, emissions came down by 15 per cent. They came down 15 per cent in six years. In the six years of this government, emissions have come down by one per cent. That's one per cent in six years. It will take 600 years to get to net zero emissions under this government's current rate of emissions cuts. The Prime Minister and the minister again today said, 'We smashed the Kyoto protocol target.' Well, the Kyoto protocol required us to cut emissions by five per cent and the government's own data shows that we're well short of that. They try to employ the overachievement during the Labor years, driven by policies that they strongly opposed, but what is clear is emissions have flatlined under this government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The second falsehood that this Prime Minister continues to put to the Australian people is that we'll meet and beat our Paris target of 26 per cent by 2030. It should have been a walk in the park, given the trajectory we were on under the last Labor government, but, again, the government's own projections published last Christmas by the government, not by me, show very clearly we are way, way off track. According to those projections in December 2019, between 2020 and 2030, on this government's policies, for a whole decade we'll cut emissions by four per cent. It will take us 230 years at that rate to get to net zero emissions. By 2030, according to their data, we'll be at 16 per cent—not 26 per cent. That was confirmed again this week by RepuTex.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When the Prime Minister says, 'We're meeting and beating the Kyoto targets. We're meeting and beating the Paris targets,' he is deliberately misleading the Australian people. I'm not just saying that. His own data says it, and the experience of the last six or seven years under this government shows it too.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This active opposition and this campaigning against climate action is obviously important for its own sake. Climate change poses a deep, mortal threat to our security and our prosperity today. We will see that when the bushfire royal commission is finally released. We saw it from the drought coordinator's report 12 months ago when he said that climate change is driving more frequent, more intense droughts that affect parts of the country that haven't been traditionally prone to drought. We will see exactly that advice, I'm sure, from the bushfire royal commission.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a threat to security and prosperity that we're already seeing play out. It's a threat that will only become deeper for our children, our grandchildren and generations of Australians beyond, if we don't act. But it's also deeply irresponsible and negligent, because there is a race on around the world. There is a race for investment and job creation in the transformation of the global economy to a clean energy economy. And that is a race that Australia should be leading. We have the best solar resources on the planet and some of the best wind resources on the planet. If we harness that with a policy framework of the type you see in so many other democracies around the world, we will be not a renewable energy superpower but the renewable energy superpower. If there was ever an opportunity for the Liberal Party to break from the Tony Abbott business model on climate change and energy policy, this pandemic was it. Investors want them to do it. Business groups want them to do it. The community and trading partners want them to do it. It's the right path for Australia. It's a path that should be paved with renewable energy, but they clearly haven't taken it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We just heard a ministerial statement full of the fatuous ideological claptrap we have come to expect from him. But, indeed, the clearest possible evidence that this Prime Minister has decided to double down on Tony Abbott's agenda is the fact that this minister is still in his job.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am pleased to introduce the Electoral Legislation Amendment (Miscellaneous Measures) Bill 2020. This bill makes technical amendments to the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 and is mirrored by amendments to the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act 1984 to ensure consistency across all electoral events.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These amendments remedy anomalies in legislation and improve clarity, to enhance electoral processes and allow greater workforce flexibility for the Australian Electoral Commission, so they can use more modern workplace practices.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill progresses technical amendments that were previously supported by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters and carried over from the last parliament. These amendments were deferred to facilitate passage of only the most urgent amendments ahead of the 2019 federal election. This bill also includes further technical amendments proposed by the AEC following the 2019 federal election.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill contains a number of measures variously designed to modernise electoral processes, build greater workforce flexibility to allow the AEC to streamline election delivery, and strengthen electoral integrity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill includes necessary amendments in response to the High Court decision in Spence v State of Queensland to better clarify the interaction between federal and state electoral laws. These amendments narrow the operation of provisions that were passed in the last parliament, to reflect the High Court's findings about the exact limits of the Commonwealth's legislative power.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The revised provisions ensure that federal law only applies exclusively to donations that are expressly for federal purposes, while fully respecting the application of state laws to amounts used for state purposes. The new rules do not purport to apply federal law exclusively to amounts that are 'untied', namely donations that are not specifically pledged to either a federal or state purpose.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To ensure integrity, the revised rules provide that if a donation is initially made for federal purposes but is subsequently used for a non-federal purpose, then the recipient will lose any immunity from state or territory law for receiving or keeping the gift. For example a political party may need to disclose the amount under state law and may be liable for penalties if the donation was not permitted under state law.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also clarifies changes made through the Electoral Legislation Amendment (Electoral Funding and Disclosure Reform) Act 2018. These changes simplify and clarify funding and entitlement rules including the rounding and indexation of public funding entitlements for eligible candidates, parties and groups.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It makes clear for avoidance of doubt that public funding for joint Senate tickets is split in proportions decided by the relevant parties and the bill allows amendments of public funding applications, including permitting applicants to clarify or add information to justify their claim;</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It also fixes an unintended contradiction between rules related to the de-registration and registration of political campaigners and associated entities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill allows greater workforce flexibility for the AEC and more nationally consistent processes. For instance, it allows the Electoral Commissioner to devolve functions of a divisional returning officer to other AEC officials. This enables the AEC to more effectively utilise its resources to ensure greater service delivery to its stakeholders, while maintaining public confidence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill reduces unnecessarily prescriptive practices, including by allowing the AEC to use the most effective postal services; permitting them to supply pens as well as pencils in polling places; and allowing variation in the order of the three questions that must be asked of voters to ascertain their entitlement to vote.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill removes the obligation for divisional offices to be pre-poll voting centres, as many are not suitable due to poor access for people with mobility issues.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A particularly welcome reform is to permit party and candidate names to be printed under a preference box on a Senate ballot instead of alongside it, to reduce the possibility of one-metre-wide Senate ballot papers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Removing stringent rules where they do not always work will reduce public confusion, without diminishing the integrity of the electoral process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill extends telephone voting to eligible Australian voters living in Antarctica, to improve the secrecy of votes for Antarctica voters and streamline operational process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will help modernise many aspects of our electoral process. Although the individual technical changes are modest, together they will help the AEC run a more efficient and responsive service for the public.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, it is important that we remain committed to improving electoral legislation in a non-partisan manner which promotes public confidence, enables our electoral system to evolve in a modernising environment, and strengthens democracy.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <a href="249147" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr KEOGH</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Burt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:29</span>):  The Electoral Legislation Amendment (Miscellaneous Measures) Bill 2020 seeks to make a number of amendments to the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 and the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act 1984, and Labor is happy to support this bill. The amendments are technical and varied. They were recommended by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters in its review of the 2016 federal election. These recommendations flowed from submissions by the independent regulator of our elections, the Australian Electoral Commission.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments contained in this bill include amendments to the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 to clarify the interaction between federal, state and territory electoral funding and disclosure regimes, following the High Court decision in Spence and Queensland. It makes technical amendments in relation to entity registration and public election funding rules, and allows a senior Australian Electoral Commission staff member, rather than a senior divisional returning officer, to be on the redistribution committee for the Australian Capital Territory. The bill also amends aspects of voting and scrutiny processes in both the Commonwealth Electoral Act and the Referendum (Machinery Provisions) Act, including extending electronically assisted voting methods to Australians working in Antarctica. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill has been considered by JSCEM. The amendments that were the subject of most of the submissions to JSCEM's inquiry were the changes to sections 302CA and 314B of the Commonwealth Electoral Act. The amendments to 302CA seek to rectify drafting errors after the High Court's decision in Spence and Queensland found that section to be wholly invalid. That section provided that, if a donation were made to a federally registered party and that donation were required to be, or may be, used for federal purposes, then the relevant state or territory law would not apply. This provision allowed gifts to be made to a party which may not be permitted at a state level as long as the gift was used or might be used for federal purposes. Under the proposed amendment, for the Commonwealth law to apply, the donation must be used for federal purposes. It is not good enough that it might merely be used for federal purposes. The amendment in section 314B would mean that donations which are above a state's threshold for disclosure but below the federal threshold, which is currently $14,300, would not need to be disclosed to the state electoral commission if they are expressly given and used for a federal purpose. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These amendments clarify the Commonwealth's power to make laws in respect of Commonwealth elections. It is appropriate that the Commonwealth has the power and that the laws it makes are not overridden by state laws. State parliaments are still free to make laws in relation to state elections. This bill is not trying to interfere with that. This bill simply confirms the Commonwealth parliament as the legislature responsible for making laws in relation to Commonwealth elections. Labor therefore supports this bill, now that two important amendments have been made in the Senate, which I'll expand on shortly. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor believes in a uniform federal system that treats federal parties and candidates equally, regardless of which state or territory they come from. The rules that federal parties and candidates play by should all be contained in the Commonwealth Electoral Act, not the various electoral acts of the eight different states and territories of our nation. If that were the case, then we would have a US style of government, where the laws that govern a federal election would be different depending on which state we lived in. We're seeing those different laws playing out right now, with some states not allowing postal voting for the current US presidential election. We are fortunate in Australia to have a uniform federal system for federal elections, and, if we do not make the changes contained in this bill, then we will be undermining that system. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As many of the submissions to JSCEM noted, the Commonwealth laws on political donations lag behind those of some of the states. But, if we do not make these amendments and state laws continue to apply to federal actors, then it is entirely possible that a state government could implement a law that is actually worse than the Commonwealth's. A state government might try to restrict the role of third-party participants in elections, such as unions or charities. If we do not make these changes, then those regressive laws could apply to participants in federal elections. The argument that these amendments should be opposed because the state laws are better doesn't hold water. We wouldn't be trying to apply a state law if it were worse, so we shouldn't want to apply it just because it is better. What we should be aiming for is a better federal system. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We recognise the concerns raised by some of the submissions to the JSCEM inquiry. We are pleased that the government listened to Labor's concerns, and an amendment was passed in the Senate to require federal donations to be paid into dedicated federal campaign accounts. Several state jurisdictions already require that separate state campaign accounts be maintained. Separate federal accounts will provide an additional layer of transparency and accountability and ensure that actors in the electoral process cannot use the Commonwealth Electoral Act to circumvent state electoral laws. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor also successfully moved an amendment in the Senate to delay the bill's commencement date until 1 December this year. This will ensure that the AEC and parties have time to familiarise themselves with the new regime and ensure that they have their compliance systems properly in place. In addition, there are currently state jurisdictions that are undergoing state or local government elections. The starting date later in the year, particularly later from when this bill was first introduced, lessens the risk of confusion for voters and election participants.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Many of the submissions to JSCEM's inquiry also highlighted the need for comprehensive donations reform to improve the transparency of our electoral system. That is Labor's position, and we have a proud history in this area. It was Labor's amendments that secured a ban on foreign donations. It was Labor's amendments that linked public funding to campaign expenditure, preventing parties from profiting from the electoral system. And let's not forget that it was Labor, under Prime Minister Hawke, that was first to introduce a donations disclosure regime, back in 1983. Indeed, even in my university honours thesis, back in 2003, I wrote about these particular issues. According to a 21-year-old version of myself:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">is a form of freedom of speech. However, the political equality of "the people" is eroded if the wealthy can determine the results of elections based on who they donate funds to and therefore provide the means to expend more money on an election campaign.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian electoral campaign finance regulatory regime is one that was established to increase equality for electoral participants, provide a level of transparency and in doing so provide for a pluralistic society in Australia.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, as I stand in the House today, Labor are continuing with our reform agenda. We currently have two bills before the Senate to deliver on our commitments. The first of these bills seeks to lower the disclosure threshold from the current $14,300 to a fixed $1,000 and removing indexation which has resulted in a blowout of the current threshold. The other bill would require real-time disclosure, where donations would be disclosed within seven days. Interestingly, this was also a recommendation from my honours thesis.</span>

The Morrison government should be supporting these bills to protect the integrity of our democratic institutions, so today I move an amendment to the motion, in the terms circulated in my name, calling for reforms to increase transparency in our system by reducing the disclosure threshold to $1,000, removing indexation of the threshold to prevent the threshold increasing over time, and requiring recipients of political donations to disclose them within seven days so that the public can know whose money is in play in funding campaigns.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To further reduce parties' reliance on fundraising and provide a relatively more level playing field to parties and candidates contesting elections, the rate of public election funding should be increased, and parties and elected Independents should be provided with administrative funding to help cover the increasing costs of compliance now being imposed by these and existing provisions in the Commonwealth Electoral Act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, we note that there were some concerns raised in JSCEM's inquiry regarding the potential for a polling official to ask a voter for identification. The current provisions in the Commonwealth Electoral Act are extremely prescriptive regarding the wording and order of questions an official must ask a voter to ascertain their entitlement to vote. The amendments in the bill provide officials with some flexibility to rephrase some of those questions. As Labor's dissenting report from the JSCEM inquiry pointed out, Labor does not support so-called voter ID laws. We do not support anything that would undermine our compulsory system of voting by discouraging people from voting. However, the Australian Electoral Commission has said that the questions can cause difficulty in circumstances where a voter has English as a second language or where they have hearing disability. We believe the flexibility provided by the amendment is warranted and we are satisfied with assurances from the Electoral Commissioner that it will not result in polling officials asking for identification. On that basis, I commend the amendment that I moved and the bill to the House.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BANDT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Melbourne</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Australian Greens</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:39</span>):  [by video link] Isn't it amazing: the government doesn't have time to deal with a federal ICAC because, apparently, it's dealing with the COVID pandemic; but it does have time to bring legislation to the parliament to allow for the laundering of political donations, to allow for the weakening of our federal donations laws so that state rules which restrict donations from developers and other kinds of corporations can now be circumvented by making a donation directly to the federal parties. Apparently, we can't get around to having a national integrity commission which would put the blowtorch on politicians and make sure that there was no corrupt behaviour happening in Canberra; we can't do that because the legislative workload is too big. What the government has got on the table to pass instead is this bill which says we are going to make it easier for developers, big corporations and corporate money to influence politics. Surprise, surprise, the Liberals are doing it hand in glove with the Labor Party, who are rushing this through with some very short speeches to make sure this gets all done and ticked off with a limited amount of public scrutiny.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's be clear about what this bill does. This bill, the Electoral Legislation Amendment (Miscellaneous Measures) Bill 2020, is designed to make it easier for corporations to donate to big political parties where the state laws would make it harder for them to do it. In other words, this bill opens up a loophole that allows corporations to get around state laws which, for example, might say developers or other forms of corporations cannot donate or that might have more stringent requirements about when the public gets to find out who has donated. With respect to of those things that state governments are starting to take some steps to rein in, because they are having an impact and because it's been bringing a bit of sunlight, transparency and integrity to politics, the government now wants to open that up and make it easier for corporations to get around those state laws.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What does it say about the priorities of this government at a time when people are crying out for a national integrity commission, where politicians would be held to the same standard in Canberra as they are in state parliaments? People want that because they have seen state ICACs send ministers of both Labor and Liberal persuasion to basically have them convicted. They have seen them convicted of criminal offences. Because those ICACs have been successful at the state level, the public knows, rightly, that corruption doesn't stop at the ACT border. The idea that politicians in Canberra are somehow of a different ilk than politicians in state parliaments is fanciful—and the public knows that. That's why the public is demanding that the federal government take action and legislate a national integrity commission.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What is crystal clear is that a big part of the reason politics has become so corrupt is the influence of corporate money. Corporations are able to make massive donations to big political parties—to Labor, the Liberals and the Nationals. Political parties take those donations and, in return, the corporations expect the politicians to do their bidding. That is why people are so fed up with politics. Politics increasingly works for the developers and for the big corporations, but it doesn't work for the people. We see it time after time after time. We see it with our climate change policy in this country. The gas and coal corporations donate millions of dollars to Labor, the Liberals and the Nationals and, as a result, climate policy in this country gets taken backwards. We had a successful carbon price when the Greens were sharing power; because of corporate power in politics, it got repealed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've seen it with the mining tax. A proper mining tax would mean people wouldn't have to pay as much to send their kids to school with so-called voluntary school fees. Or you might not have to pay as much for your electricity bill because it hadn't been privatised; instead, we had revenue coming into the public kitty that was available to be invested in public services. That mining tax got knocked off because of the influence of big corporations and mining billionaires. When these people and these corporations donate to Labor, the Liberals and the Nationals they expect something in return—and they get it. That is part of the reason people are fed up with politics. So not only do we need a national integrity commission—a national ICAC, which the government says it's too busy to do, because instead it's busy passing laws to weaken donation rules—but we also need to get the corporate money out of politics with donations reform. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When the government said, 'We're bringing a bill to parliament that is going to bring about donations reform,' for a moment some of us were a bit excited, because we thought that maybe the government and Labor had listened to the people who want to get the corporate money out of politics. But, no. What do we have? Instead, we have a bill that opens up new loopholes. Labor and Liberal are both defending this bill and both passing it through the parliament as quickly as they possibly can, with the minimum of scrutiny, because apparently it's more important that political parties are able to get big corporate donations than it is to pass a national integrity commission. In the arguments for this bill, they have said, 'We wouldn't want state efforts to somehow undermine federal laws.' </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Do you know what? The states are doing what the federal parliament is refusing to do. Some states, under significant pressure from the public, have taken steps to rein in the role of corporate donations. They have done it in three ways. One way is that they have said there are certain kinds of corporations that can't donate. So in some places you have bans on developers donating, for example. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A second way is they've said there are going to be limits on how much you can donate. That is good, because sometimes that goes hand in hand with caps on how much political parties can spend. And that's something we have to do—we have to put caps on not only how much can be donated but how much can be spent during elections, because if you turn off the ability to spend it at the end, you are going to also turn off the reason to start getting so much money in in the first place. That's something that some state parliaments have done, and it's starting to work. It's starting to get the money out of politics. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The third thing that some state parliaments have done is say, 'Voters have the right to know, quickly, who is donating to what political party.' This is important. This is critical, because, at the federal level, it can be years before you find out which corporations have donated to Labor or Liberal or the Nationals. It can be years before you find that out, and by that time the election has been and gone and you've cast your vote, thinking, 'Maybe, the politician I voted for will act independently', without knowing that they're actually a wholly-bought subsidiary of the corporation that paid for them. Some have suggested that it might be a good idea if politicians were forced to wear the logos of their donors on their suits when they come in, a bit like football players who wear their sponsors on them, so that at least you could have some insight that this particular politician was bought by Santos gas, or this politician was bought by a coal corporation. But, until that happens, the next best thing we've got is disclosure of the donations. So we need to restrict how much these corporations can donate and we need to limit how much can be spent, but, for so long as we have these donations, the public is entitled to know who is donating. These should be laws that apply across the board. Some states have started to do that, so that you know, in closer to real time, about the donations that have been made. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill, which Liberal and Labor are ramming through, will enable donors to get around it. How? How do you get around it? You donate to the federal party instead of donating to the state party that might be subject to the state laws, and then you're not subject to those stringent rules anymore. If, internally, the federal party wants to then slosh that corporate money back through to its state entity, well, this law doesn't deal with that. This law leaves that option to them. And won't find out about it for years. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is why the Greens say that this weakening of our donations laws by Labor and Liberal and the Nationals working hand-in-hand to rush a bill through the House is another threat to democracy. It's another threat to democracy because it allows the big corporations to have a huge say over what happens in parliament. For so long as the money is able to come in and control what politicians do and how politicians vote, politics is going to be about putting the corporate interests ahead of the public interest for Labor and Liberal and the Nationals. So it's no surprise that the establishment parties are lining up to rush this bill through parliament ahead of having a federal integrity commission. They are doing it because they take corporate donations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens don't take the big corporate donations because we know that when you are taking in donations you have got to be crystal clear that it is not going to affect the position that you take in parliament. So we don't get the big corporate donations that the others do. But they do. They would much rather keep getting the money from corporations, so they are prepared to pass this bill—Labor, Liberal and Nationals—to circumvent state laws that shine a bit of light on political donations. They are passing this law to get around state governments who have taken steps to restrict political donations, and they are doing it ahead of having a federal integrity commission.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This law speaks volumes about the priorities of this government and this parliament. It is apparently more important to keep the door open and find a back door to allow political donations to flow through to state parties through the federal party than it is to tighten things up. It is time in this country to get—</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is time to get the big corporate money out of politics. It is time to have reform of our donations laws in this country. It is time to ensure that there is a limit as to how much people and corporations can donate and there is a limit on what can be spent during elections. It is time to say there is absolutely no role for the likes of tobacco or fossil fuel corporations to be donating to political parties. We need to know with absolute certainty that decisions that are made in this place are being done for the public interest, not for vested interests and not for the corporate interests.

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr HAINES</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Indi</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:53</span>):  I was taken aback, but not at all surprised, to watch the government prioritise this bill on the schedule this week, the Electoral Legislation Amendment (Miscellaneous Measures) Bill 2020. 'Miscellaneous' is the best descriptor of this bill. It's even in the title of the bill itself. The past two weeks of parliament have illustrated beyond doubt the blinding moment we have arrived at as a nation and as a parliament when it comes to the question of integrity in federal politics. Australians feel demoralised and angered by the unending revelations from Senate estimates and the reckless behaviour of some parliamentarians in this place. Australians are asking themselves how deep the culture of entitlement and disregard for the public good goes in our body politic. Australians are desperate to know where the threads lead to and how systemic corruption allegations are. How long is that piece of string, Mr Speaker? This bill and our current integrity laws give Australians no comfort, nor answers, to those questions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me explain for the record what this bill does. This bill locks in the status quo when it comes to the current political donations culture at the federal level. In May last year the High Court upheld the validity of the anti-corruption measures in Queensland which prohibit the making of political donations by property developers. Those measures in Queensland are decent and improve transparency and accountability in electoral funding. Of course, those measures don't exist at the federal level. Indeed, it's crystal clear that this government wants to minimise and tokenise discussion on transparency and accountability in federal politics as much as possible. When forced to reflect on the need for greater transparency and accountability in politics, through a High Court decision, this government has chosen to produce a superficial bill to lock in the status quo. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government has turned around this miscellaneous bill in the same time it said it could not possibly pass any integrity reforms, because of the coronavirus response. This could have been a moment for the government to come with clean hands to this parliament and have a robust and principled discussion about integrity reform writ large. Instead, it's decided to back itself in. This is not the bill Australians wanted to see this week. At a moment when Australians want hope for the future of their democracy, this bill is disappointing and cannot be characterised in any way as noble electoral reform.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have received overwhelming support this week for the Australian Federal Integrity Commission Bill, which I introduced on Monday. I've received support from MPs across this parliament, on both sides, and from the vast majority of Australians across the political spectrum, imploring this parliament to debate and pass sophisticated integrity reforms as a matter of urgency. The Australian Federal Integrity Commission Bill, which I introduced on Monday, includes a comprehensive, independent, statutory review of political finance, funding, donations, and campaign regulation at the federal level, within the next 18 months. The bill I introduced on Monday includes a specific clause that makes it abundantly clear that it is the intention of this parliament to revise federal laws on transparency, integrity and accountability in political campaign finance and campaign regulation so that it meets best practice and is streamlined within the objectives and operation of counterpart laws at state and territory level.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, I make no statement on what those final provisions should be. I'm here to work with my parliamentary colleagues in a constructive way to make those reforms as ambitious and as practical as they can be. What I will say is that the vision I and many others in the parliament have for our democracy goes well beyond minor tweaks to electoral laws in Antarctica, like we see in this bill. I cannot express how short this bill falls at a moment when Australians are desperate for honest reflection and a political culture that's pro integrity, not just anti corruption. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The parliaments of New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland have set a disclosure threshold on political donations at $1,000, but there's no equivalent law at the federal level. New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland and South Australia require near real-time disclosure of donations, yet the Commonwealth requires disclosure just once a year, and then seven months after the reporting period has ended. There are caps on expenditure in some jurisdictions, but not for those of us here. The New South Wales Electoral Commission actively pursues breaches, yet the Australian Electoral Commission rarely employs its coercive powers, as the Senate finance and public administration committee heard in 2017. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have long been on record in this space. I was pleased to second a private member's bill from the member for Mayo in December last year that sought to usher in measured and evidence based political donation reforms. That bill would have extended the definition of 'reporting entities' to include political entities, campaigners and third parties; lowered the political donation disclosure threshold from $14,300 to $2,500; and required real-time disclosure by reporting entities within seven days of a reportable donation being made so that Australians could see and understand who was supporting who at what times, at the right time. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've also been working with Senate crossbench colleagues, all of whom are enthusiastic to act in this space as well in lockstep with the wishes of the Australian public. This is not the bill Australians wanted to see this week. This is not the direction that Australians want the conversation on integrity in federal politics and campaign finance to go. This bill is exactly what it says it is: miscellaneous.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I call on all parliamentarians in this place to admit we can be more sophisticated and robust when it comes to integrity and when it comes to integrity reforms and to commit to working collaboratively with me and others in this place to have the right detailed conversation, to build a consensus vision and to write laws that reflect who we aspire to be and what the Australian people are crying out for. Let's get real about this. Let's stop talking about miscellaneous things. Let's talk about the real issue here and let's instil some values into this place.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="C2T" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr WILKIE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Clark</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:03</span>):  This Electoral Legislation Amendment (Miscellaneous Measures) Bill 2020 is simply unsupportable because it will have the effect of watering down the state and territory donation laws. So I will vote against the bill. Frankly, I am shocked that the government would seek to water down political donation laws at a time when the country is crying out for much stronger political donation laws. It is abundantly clear that, at the federal level, our political donation laws are unsatisfactory and need to be reformed deeply. For example, the disclosure threshold of $14,300 is ridiculously high. We are all doing okay in this place, but to the average member of the community that is an enormous amount of money and it is more than enough money to influence a candidate or political party. So why do we tolerate that? In fact, not only do we tolerate that $14,300; we agree that it should be indexed from time to time. It is way too high.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact that, currently, the disclosures can be made well after an election is ludicrous, because the fact is that, when a voter goes into the polling booth, he or she needs to know and often wants to know who has bankrolled the candidates and the parties that are on the ballot paper in front of them. Most donations in a political cycle come in very close to an election and so are not disclosed until maybe 18 months later, when the election is long forgotten and people have lost interest in that election. That is entirely unacceptable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no limit on how much any one donor can donate. It is bizarre. In Australia, if you've got a hundred million dollars, you could donate the whole lot to the Liberal Party or the Labor Party or a candidate or whoever you want. That's an absurdity. What that ensures is that the richest donors, the richest people, effectively have more political power than other members of the community. What on earth happened to the idea of one person, one vote of equal value? It doesn't exist in this country, because we live in a country where, regrettably, money buys political power and the people with the most money have the most political power, and that's entirely unacceptable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are also no limits on who can donate. It's not unusual for some parties in particular, some candidates in particular, to be very happy to take money from the tobacco industry, certainly the gambling industry, and some other dubious industries. What we in this place should do is have a bill before the House that brings in some of the safeguards that exist in states and territories about exactly who can donate. The fact that the bill on the table will undercut those very safeguards I think is unconscionable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Also, we don't have any restrictions at all on non-overtly political actors when it comes to what they're up to. I would have thought that if, say, an industry group or maybe an individual were to, say, run an advertising campaign that had clear political connotations and steered people towards one political point of view or another, surely the expenditure on that should be regarded as a political donation. Let's talk about the mining industry, back when the mining tax was a big issue. The behaviour of the mining industry at that point was to any reasonable person a political donation to the LNP because it had the material effect of benefiting the LNP.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have all sorts of strife when it comes to political donations in this country, and it beggars belief that we're not in here talking about them and addressing them. The fact is we do live in a country where people buy political influence. Let's face it, when a person or a corporation, for example, donate a large sum of money it's not through altruism. It's because they want a return on that investment, and—heavens!—don't they often get a return on that investment. I'm reminded of a somewhat remarkable quote from a former senator—I won't say who it was—who once said that if someone donates $1,000 they support you and if someone donates $100,000 they've bought you. Regrettably, that senator ultimately did take a donation of over $100,000 and was in a very awkward situation, but the point he made is a very valid point. When you look at the returns that we do get from the Electoral Commission you see enormous donations are being made. For example, in 2011 James Packer donated $250,000 to the fledgling Katter's Australian Party at the very point in time when Bob Katter personally had a crucial vote with the poker machine reforms I was trying to push through the parliament. Why did James Packer give Bob Katter $250,000 at that point in time? Was it altruism? No. It was no better, quite frankly, than what happens in some of the countries we criticise for a bag of cash being handed over. The only thing that made it better than a bag of cash in some dodgy country was that, many, many months later, it was revealed to the public, too late to make a difference to the community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While I'm talking about Crown, it's worth remembering a very interesting statistic. The member for Mayo just last week mentioned the revelation that Crown has donated almost $2 million to political parties in the last 10 years or so. Almost $2 million from Crown has gone to the major political parties over 10 years, and then we wonder why there's no interest in this place for a royal commission into the casino industry and Crown casino. Of course there won't be, because you're all on the take. The Labor Party, the Liberal Party, the National Party—you're all on the take. Someone is paying millions of dollars in political donations, and what a great return on that investment they're getting.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The solutions are very, very simple. Ideally we would have publicly funded elections. In other words, we would ban all political donations. Instead of any political donation, candidates and parties would get a modest and known amount of money, and that's all they would be allowed to spend at election time. That would be ideal. I know that would be something that some members of the community would not support, but a government with leadership, the opposition, the crossbench—if we all educated the public so they understood the benefits of publicly funded elections, I think we would have the vast majority of the people supporting it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If we don't want to go that far, we could perhaps adopt the New Zealand model, where donations are allowed but the expenditure is capped in certain areas so that donations become much less important. For example, in New Zealand, the parties are limited in what they can spend on television advertising. If there were a limit on how much you could spend on television advertising here, heavens! Poor old Palmer United Party—they'd be reined in. It wouldn't matter that Clive Palmer is a very wealthy man and buys political influence. If there were a cap on how much TV advertising he could run then all of that wealth would become much less important.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If we're not going to have publicly funded elections and if we're not going to put caps on election expenditure, why don't we do the really easy stuff? Why not have, for example, a donation disclosure threshold of $1,000—not $14,300 but $1,000. That would makes sense. That would mean that anyone who's handing over $50 or $100—a small, modest donation from a regular member of the community—would not be disclosed. That would actually be agreeable to many of those donors. For example, if you're in the Public Service you might not want, for good reason, a $50 donation disclosed, for fear that it might be damaging to your career in some way. It's the same with a teacher or a police officer or even just someone in the workplace whose views are at odds with their boss's. So make those really small donations confidential, but donations over $1,000 should be disclosed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another solution, one that is so important, is real-time reporting. There is no technical reason why every single donation in this country can't be up on a website within perhaps 24 hours of the donation occurring, instead of 18 months after the election, when the information is next to useless. At the last federal election, I'm proud to say I had real-time reporting of donations over $1,000. They were up on my website, andrewwilkie.org, within 24 hours. I think Senator Jacqui Lambie did the same thing, and perhaps some of my crossbench colleagues as well. The feedback from my community was very positive. People really liked to see that, and they certainly would like to have seen it rolled out by the major political parties.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's a very interesting point, actually. We don't need to change the law for candidates and parties to improve their behaviour. I note that the opposition has moved an amendment to this bill, which I will support, to bring in changes like a $1,000 disclosure threshold. If the opposition is fair dinkum about that—and I hope they are—they don't need it to become more for them to do that themselves at the next election. If the government's got some bright ideas, they don't need the law changed either to change their behaviour at the next election. But again it's left to us crossbenchers to set the example and take the lead on this sort of thing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also need a prohibition on donations from problematic sectors. That is just self-evident. And the obvious one is the gambling lobby. Put an end to Crown casino donating a couple of hundred thousand dollars every year for a decade. Put an end to Jamie Packer giving a quarter of a million dollars to Bob Katter when his vote was crucial on poker machine reform. Put an end to all that. Say the gambling industry is out of bounds, as are other unethical industries, like the tobacco industry, for example. There are other industries we might consider in that list as well. Certainly the state and territory governments are very alert to property developers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We could also put a cap on the gross amount of donations from any one source during an electoral cycle. I will leave it to experts to come up with the exact figure—maybe $10,000 maybe $100,000. I'm open-minded about what the exact figure is. But these donors that just trickle the donations out a bit at a time, under the threshold every time, need to be reined in. We need to say that no one company in this country and no one person in this country should have more political power than any other organisation or person. So we might make it that $10,000 is the maximum amount that Westpac, CommBank, BHP or someone down the road can donate to any one candidate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also need to be much more alert to the fact that, for anyone or any organisation that does anything that materially benefits a political party or a candidate, the value of what they do should be regarded as a political donation. If I start putting billboards up around Hobart supporting the policy of some other political party then the value of me doing that should be regarded as a donation to that political party. I think that's self-evident. Probably the most important thing we should do—and it's already been touched on by the crossbench many times, including before me this morning, is have an integrity commission. The Electoral Act is very narrow. The Electoral Commission has very limited powers—way too limited. If we're not going to bolster the act and the AEC then it is even more important that we have a federal integrity commission that can go to areas where the AEC and the Electoral Act don't go, because there are so many issues which really double up.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've seen it in the recent times, where political donors mysteriously get a political favour after the election. Why did Foxtel get $30 million or $40 million? Where did that come from? Why did the Great Barrier Reef Foundation get all that dough? What was this land sale for Badgerys Creek the other day? Of course, the governments say there is nothing to see here, that it's just happenstance that a big, fat political donor gets a big, fat political pay-off after the election. It's corruption. And that's why we need an integrity commission of some kind.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again it's left to the crossbench to take the lead. It's fascinating that it's pretty much only the crossbench that's speaking on this bill.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Warringah</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:20</span>):  The Electoral Legislation Amendment (Miscellaneous Measures) Bill 2020 makes a collection of unrelated amendments to the Commonwealth Electoral Act. Hidden beneath the innocuous title of 'miscellaneous measures'—well, really calling them miscellaneous says it all—is an effort to override something serious. It's an effort to override state and territory legislation to make political donations less transparent, directly against the wishes of the Australian people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's telling that after the minister introduced this—I can only describe it as a rubbish bill—and the shadow minister supported it, the only people speaking on this insulting legislation to the Australian people and to our democracy are the crossbench members. If you ever wonder why we are Independent, this issue and this type of legislation is exactly why.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In Australia, if you donate anything less than $14,300 there are almost no disclosure requirements at the federal level. This bill could have addressed that. Indeed, over time there have been numerous bills presented by the crossbench before the other place, and in this place, that have sought to do that. But, rather than address the lack of transparency of political donations, this bill seeks to override the more stringent state and territory legislation, seeking to do just that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's be honest about what's going on here: the government and the opposition need this bill because the current clause, which the government introduced in the last sitting of parliament, relating to section 302CA, was deemed unconstitutional by the High Court last year. The section relates to how federal political finance laws for political donations interact with state and territory laws. In 2019, the High Court in Spence v State of Queensland, ruled by majority, held that section 302CA of the Commonwealth Electoral Act was invalid for going beyond the limits of Commonwealth legislative power conferred by section 51 of the Constitution. Section 302CA had been worded carefully to ensure that it was up to parties—of course we would be trusting the parties—to determine whether a donation would be used for federal or state purposes; therefore, trying to get around the prohibitions that exist at state level. If deemed destined for federal level, then Commonwealth reporting requirements would apply. This meant that it's to the advantage of major parties, as Commonwealth legislation sets a much, much lower bar than the legislation in all state and territories bar Tasmania. This is deplorable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In recent years, states and territories have moved to level the playing field and increase transparency around disclosure of political donations, especially from property developers, mining companies and liquor and gambling groups. But, since the High Court ruling last year, the law has operated such that both federal and state law operate at the same time. Therefore, where some donations may not be captured at a federal level, they are at state and territory level. This is a good thing, as they are then beholden to the state and territory reporting laws. This bill dangerously seeks to override that. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill is carefully worded in response to the ruling of the High Court to make sure that donations to federal parties will not be subject to the strict reporting requirements of states and territories. I would rather see the removal of the unconstitutional section 302CA and section 314B of the Commonwealth Electoral Act rather than rewarding that. That would have been if the government had been actually intent on improving transparency around donations. But, no, it is trying to get around any kind of accounting or transparency. What's interesting is that it's supported by the opposition, by Labor, because there are obviously also a lot of questions around transparency when it comes to union donations. What we desperately need is an even playing field. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If we had a scheme between state and federal donation regimes that operated together as one scheme, that would be common sense. So state branches of political parties would have to disclose their donations according to the rules in their jurisdiction. But, in the absence of strong donation laws at the Commonwealth level, the only way to ensure that state branches don't use technicalities and loopholes to hide their donations are the state disclosure regimes. We're not talking or advocating here on the crossbench for something that maybe stands outside of what's been recommended by most Australians or by the appropriate bodies. This is recommended by the integrity experts in submissions to the inquiry on this bill, including the Human Rights Law Centre and the Centre for Public Integrity. In their submission, the Centre for Public Integrity said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Commonwealth Government should be strengthening our electoral laws, not weakening them. The Commonwealth should look to the precedence set in Australian states on the regulation of money in politics.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Human Rights Law Centre said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The free flow of money into Australia's political system threatens the integrity of our democracy. Major political donations are designed to have political influence. Big donations may give donors extra access to politicians or, as put by the High Court, establish the donor as a politician's "client".</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are the words of the High Court. Further:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Occasionally, political donations may lead to <span style="font-style:italic;">quid pro quo</span> corruption.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, these are the words of the highest court in Australia. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What proposed new sections 302CA and 314B are trying to do is get around that ruling of High Court and destroy the efficiency of the state disclosure regimes. It's highly disappointing that this legislation has the support of both sides of the House. But it does not have the support of the crossbench. States are the only jurisdictions that are doing something about at least prohibiting donations and reforming political donations at this stage. The need for transparency and accountability in the funding of our political parties is imperative, but, because it goes to them, it's the very reason why they are united in supporting this. When we talk of political donations, we are talking of political donations from the private sector, from the unions, across the board. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Look at decisions made by parties when they are in government. I would have to say, under the current government, the decisions to build new coal-fired power stations and coalmines and to open up gas fields and spruik a gas-led recovery are decisions that don't make sense where commercial rates are not being paid. The Leppington land sale has to be an example that is so prominent in our mind. We need to know where the imperative for this is coming from. Is it ideology? Is it maybe to win seats? Or is it to line the pockets of those making the decisions or that will benefit from the decisions? The reality is that, without strong laws on disclosures of political donations, we won't know why the government continues to make uneconomic decisions that go against the interest of so many sectors. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">States are doing their bit to clean up politics. We have certainly seen a lot of headlines from state politics over the years where corruption has been caught and there is an integrity commission to enable the proper investigation of corruption allegations. But, here, instead of trying to improve our status and increase the trust of the Australian people in our democracy, the government has gone around the Constitution to subvert those laws at the state level and is now sharpening its response and trying to get around the High Court decision.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's clear that we desperately need an integrity commission to keep an eye on dodgy deals and dodgy spending of public money. The government in this place continues to delay implementing such a body. I thank the member for Indi for moving to establish an Australian federal integrity commission and a code of conduct for members in this place, and I urge the government and the opposition to bring that bill on for debate as soon as possible. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Regular surveys show that 80 per cent of the Australian people support the establishment of a federal corruption watchdog. The reality is that a federal integrity commission would provide a forum for investigation and inquiry, an opportunity for wrongdoers to be exposed and for those wrongly accused to be exonerated. All sides of politics claim to support the need for a federal integrity commission, but the Australian people have seen no action. The government promised to establish an integrity commission over two years ago but has repeatedly delayed and prioritised other legislation. If the opposition, Labor, are so strong on this commitment, I call on them to make very clear that they support the model put out by the member for Indi and supported by the crossbench or at the very least come up and explain what the elements are they don't like about that model. But let's be clear: you can't say you stand for anticorruption and integrity but not get behind the legislation that is before this House.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course we also need a bit of truth in political advertising. The Commonwealth Electoral Act that is amended by this legislation is also where the governance of political advertising is found. Amazingly, truth in political advertising is not protected under any Australian law. The Australian consumer law against misleading and deceptive conduct relates only to trade and commerce. The Electoral Act only makes it a crime to mislead or deceive an elector about how to mark their ballot paper. Not even the advertising standards board will review political advertising. Civil action can be taken only where the content is defamatory, and while it may be impractical to have every poster, social media post and broadcast ad reviewed for truth we must regulate for a minimum standard of truth in political advertising.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">South Australia has had a prohibition on misleading or deceptive statements in electoral campaigns since 1985. This year, the ACT Legislative Assembly passed a very similar law. Polling by The Australia Institute shows that nine in 10 Australians support legislation for truth in political advertising. It is certainly time for the Commonwealth government to look seriously at the need for political honesty, and it is certainly time for the opposition to get behind it. But, instead of that type of legislation, we have this kind of miscellaneous legislation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It so clear that, with the advent of technology that supports the creation of deep fakes and so much fake news, we absolutely need to have some legislation on truth in political advertising as well as so much more legislation around political donation laws. The ability to alter and distort images, videos or voices to portray a candidate as doing or saying something they have never done or said has already been used overseas by both domestic and foreign actors. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission considered the threat of deep fakes in their recent digital platform review. Similarly, the threat of deep fakes is a concern of the review of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters of the 2019 election.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia has a chance to be a world leader in legislating against the use of deep fakes, so I urge the government to think about the real issues we have to protect democracy and to increase transparency, rather than putting up this kind of miscellaneous legislation that seeks to undermine democracy and get around rulings of the High Court. I won't be supporting this bill in its current form, as it seeks to weaken protections against undue influence at a time when Australians need those protections strengthened.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mayo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:36</span>):  This bill won't get media attention, but it should. I always say to my community, 'Pay careful attention to legislation when both the majors are pushing it through, and you have one person speaking from each side and you have the entire crossbench'—well, virtually the entire crossbench; all those who are present, including the member for Melbourne—'against it.'</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill, the Electoral Legislation Amendment (Miscellaneous Measures) Bill 2020, will make donations easier for developers and big donors who may be restricted by individual states' donation laws. We have a system in Australia where most states have tighter donation laws than those at the federal level, and you see here a piece of legislation that is going to weaken that for some of those states. The majors have come together, saying, 'Let's get this through. We've got to get this through. This is important. It's going to make it easier for those big donors, easier for those developers. They're going to be able to go to expensive events and make donations at those state events, and it's going to go to the federal parties, because that's okay.' It actually makes a mockery of the work that many state legislators have done to rein in political donations and try to improve their standing in the community. There are lower disclosure rates in those states, but, of course, federally you can have someone donate $14,300 before anyone in Australia is any the wiser. You can have a family of five donate $70,000 at some glitzy affair, and nobody knows. Nobody knows, because it goes to the federal party. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Clark mentioned money that Crown casino has generously donated to the major parties over recent years. I think $1.7 million is about the tally, if you have a look at the Australian Electoral Commission information. A member in here came up to me after we'd been talking about this, and he said, 'That's not a lot of money.' Who are we kidding in here? The Australian community does not want to see unions and big corporations give over millions of dollars to political parties. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2018, a report by the Museum of Australian Democracy found that trust in democracy was on the decline, with satisfaction in democracy having more than halved in a decade, and trust in key institutions and social leaders eroding. When the public has lost trust in politicians, when that is at an all-time low, political donation reform is one way that we can very easily restore trust in this place. What do we see? We don't see legislation to lower the threshold coming to this place, we don't see legislation to put in place a cap and we don't even see legislation for real-time disclosure; what we see is legislation to make it easier for shovelfuls of money to go into the major political parties.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We should be following Canada's rules. In Canada, no man, woman or child can donate more than Can$1,600 to a political party or, indeed, to an independent candidate. They don't accept money from the corporations— corporations can't donate. They don't accept money from unions. That's the kind of transparency, the kind of trust, the kind of system that we need to look at. Also, if a donation over $200 has been received the candidate needs to disclose it. In Canada they manage to run that quite effectively, yet here we don't seem to move. In fact if we do move, we move in the wrong direction. As I said, we can't even get a bill up in here to lower the threshold to a thousand dollars.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to get money out of this place, not create more loopholes that mean even more money flows from the big donors. If we in this place—all of us, individually and collectively—truly believe we want to improve the trust the Australian community has in us, we need to get money out of this place, not bring more in.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">McPherson</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Industry, Science and Technology</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:41</span>):  I would like to thank all those in this chamber who have contributed to the debate on the Electoral Legislation Amendment (Miscellaneous Measures) Bill 2020. I echo the Minister for Finance's thanks to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters for their thorough review of the bill and their examination of the issues raised in submissions. The committee found that the reforms in the bill will deliver important enhancements to our electoral system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 is one of the oldest pieces of legislation in Australia. This bill is a housekeeping piece of legislation that helps facilitate the proper functioning of our parliamentary democracy. The reforms in this bill are important to help modernise parts of the electoral system and to assist the AEC to deliver effective and timely electoral events. Many of the amendments in this bill were included in an earlier technical amendment bill in the last parliament. While those reforms were recognised at the time as necessary, they were carried across to the current parliament so the AEC could focus on the delivery of the most urgent machinery changes ahead of the 2019 federal election.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill contains numerous improvements. Key among these, it extends a confidential voting service to Australian voters working in Antarctica; removes the requirement to designate some divisional offices as prepoll centres where they are unfit for purpose, including lacking disability access; helps contain the width of the Senate ballot by allowing candidate names to be printed underneath preference boxes instead of only alongside boxes; clarifies the interaction between federal, state and territory funding and disclosure regimes; and allows flexibility in wording of questions to help find a voter on the roll, which will better assist people with a non-English-speaking background or those with a hearing disability.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In summary, these reforms will improve the operational efficiency of elections, remove overly prescriptive language in the act, improve services to particular disadvantaged or geographically remote voter groups, and strengthen electoral integrity and administration. Once again, I thank my colleagues for their contribution and commend this bill to the House.</span>

The amendments moved by the government and supported by the opposition are a direct attempt to circumvent a ruling by the High Court on stronger state donation laws. This is contrary to what the Australian people want to see in this place, and we finally have people here to actually acknowledge what this is about.</span>

This goes to the intent of section 302CA, gifts made for federal purposes. The Commonwealth has the weakest political finance laws in Australia in relation to donations. The proposed amendments mean that stronger state bills would be overwritten by weaker Commonwealth laws, thereby limiting their effectiveness.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Professor Anne Twomey, in her submission, questioned the intent of the amendments. She asked:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Given that the provisions seem to be quite deliberately drafted to achieve this end, it does make one wonder why. Are political parties aware of the existence of large amounts of donations that are unlawful under State laws, which they want to ensure they can keep? Is this a means of also avoiding any State laws that would not only require the return of unlawfully received donations but also penalise the party that adopts them (such as the NSW provision that requires a party to return double the value of the donation if it knew the donation was unlawful)? Are political parties hoping to be able to attract and retain such donations in the future, despite the application of State law, perhaps gambling on a State failing properly to police or enforce its laws, while still protecting the recipient parties if the donors are caught?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Professor Twomey argues:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is apparent that the drafters of this Bill were not only conscious of this problem, but also concerned that it might be unconstitutional, given that the purpose of the donation is not required to be 'earmarked from the outset'. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These clauses show deliberate effort from the government and the opposition to work around state and territory electoral laws and any constitutional challenge. They clarify that a political party can still use a political donation for federal purposes, even though a state law has validly prohibited it. In addition to the ability to connive to get around state laws, there are also questions about the ability to launder political donations through this new regime, and concerns about additional administrative complexity in policing the law. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This amendment to the bill calls for the existing section 302CA of the act to be repealed, as it was deemed unconstitutional. This is important legislation, and it is only in the interests of obfuscating where donations are coming from—whether that be from private companies or unions—that people are supporting this rubbish. </span>

The High Court has made it clear that the previous attempt by the government was unconstitutional, and this is simply an attempt to get around the High Court ruling. Members supporting this bill should be held accountable for the fact that they are going directly against the wishes of the Australian people. Eighty per cent want more transparency in political donations, and these amendments I have moved seek to do that, in contrast to the miscellaneous measures of the bill, which seek to obfuscate where donations are coming from.</span>

It is every bit as much money laundering as any other form of money laundering that goes on in this country. Frankly, if no-one else will look at it, AUSTRAC should have a look at it, because that's what it is.

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mayo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:18</span>):  I rise in support of the Social Services and Other Legislation Amendment (Coronavirus and Other Measures) Bill 2020. I recognise that the proposed additional economic support payments are necessary to support those on Centrelink payments such as the disability support pension and the age pension. As the member for the oldest electorate in South Australia, I am sure many of the constituents in Mayo who currently receive these payments will welcome these additional funds. I'm also supportive of the proposed retrospective changes to the youth allowance independent paid work concession. That will support young people who continue to work towards financial independence. This change acknowledges the impact that COVID-19 had on the employment status of many young people in our communities and ensures they're not penalised for an economic crisis that was by no means their fault.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A revision of the paid parental leave work test period is also welcomed as this measure openly acknowledges the impact COVID-19 has had on a parent's ability to remain employed during one of the toughest economic downturns in Australia's history. Providing working parents with more lenient requirements to access their payment has the potential to support many more parents to remain home with their newborns instead of being forced to return to work early so they can continue to pay their bills.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am, however, disappointed to see that there is no mention of the fortnightly $250 corona supplement continuing past 31 December. If you have a look at the Centrelink website, it says, 'From 1 January 2021 your payment will change to the normal JobSeeker rate.' Just to inform the House exactly what that normal JobSeeker rate is, if you are single and you don't have children, it is $565.70 a fortnight. That's not a week; that's a fortnight. It works out to be $282.85 a week. If you are single and have dependent children, it's $612 a fortnight—so just over $300 a week.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's worth noting that this supplement not only supports the 1.56 million people currently receiving JobSeeker and youth allowance payments across Australia; the additional supplement has also provided much-needed financial assistance to parents receiving the parenting payment, students receiving Austudy and ABSTUDY living allowance and farmers receiving the farm household allowance. Nearly two million Australians are having to remain vigilant, struggling to plan for their future or even budget for Christmas, and they do not know if their fortnightly $250 coronavirus supplement—that extra $125 a week—will continue past the end of this year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation provided the government with an opportunity to put millions of people's minds at rest and to provide them with certainty, acknowledging that this year has been one of the toughest yet. We are all aware that the cost of living has increased since COVID hit, and the additional coronavirus supplement has been necessary to ensure individuals and families are able to meet those increased expenses. For years now I have called on the government to raise the rate of Newstart, now named JobSeeker, as most recipients were living below the poverty line prior to the introduction of the coronavirus supplement. These additional funds have provided a much-needed reprieve for individuals and families who were previously struggling with rent, school fees and other essential items. Unlike many Newstart recipients, most of us in this place have never needed to make the choice between purchasing meals from the supermarket or paying rent to ensure that we have a roof over our head. We mustn't forget that that coronavirus supplement actually helps all of our local businesses, because it gives people who are on Centrelink that extra money and then they spend it locally. They are not spending it on overseas holidays. They are spending it in our local IGA. They are spending it in our local grocery stores.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, in closing, I do support this legislation. I would urge the government to provide some certainty to people who are on Centrelink and currently receiving that coronavirus supplement, particularly people who are on JobSeeker, formerly known as Newstart, because no Australian can live on just over $250 a week. It really just is impossible.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GOSLING</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Solomon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:23</span>):  A lot of big figures have been thrown around in the last few months—billions of dollars of support and a trillion-dollar debt—but it is grave news indeed, and I want to let all of our fellow Australians who are listening this morning know, that as of yesterday we found out that there will be 1.8 million Australians on unemployment payments by Christmas. Under this coalition federal government, we've seen a situation whereby an extraordinary number of Australians will be unemployed and needing that social support. We have seen the new Department of Social Services' figures come out of Senate estimates that show the number of people on unemployment payments will increase by many hundreds of thousands and will indeed surge to about 1.8 million by December. My colleague Senator Katy Gallagher, the shadow minister for finance, confirmed this in a question to a DSS official in Senate estimates. At estimates, it was also confirmed that the number of people forced to get by on unemployment benefits will be higher in 2024 than it was before the recession. That is no nowhere near a snapback in terms of getting Australians back into jobs—and this is what we feared.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Barton and shadow minister for social services said: 'These revised figures show this job crisis is getting worse and the government's planned Christmas JobSeeker cut will hurt 1.8 million Australians. Unemployment is painful and unfair. Hundreds of thousands of Australians will bear the impact of this recession for years to come. The Prime Minister needs to show compassion by announcing a permanent increase to the JobSeeker payment.' I wholeheartedly agree with the member for Barton. The budget was a missed opportunity to permanently increase JobSeeker. With up to 160,000 Australians expected to lose their jobs and 1.6 million Australians on JobSeeker, the government missed a massive opportunity to deliver certainty for Australians doing it tough by delivering a permanent increase to JobSeeker in the budget. With more jobseekers for each job vacancy, there are simply not enough jobs for everyone who needs one. Unlike what the Prime Minister is fond of saying, it is not a case of 'if you're good at your job you'll get a job'; there simply aren't enough jobs. To not be able to see that is, unfortunately, a dereliction of duty and a failure of leadership.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is particularly difficult in our regions, where the job market is worse than in the cities. In the major cities you have the benefit of large populations. As businesses and the economy open up, there will be employment. It will still be difficult for some cohorts, but there will be employment. In the regions we want to see more support. Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be an understanding of the correlation between cutting JobSeeker and the effect on small businesses. ACOSS have published a report that talks about the massive benefit to the economy of this indirect stimulus. As I've been saying for months now, as far as the Territory is concerned, the people that I represent from Darwin and Palmerston, the business owners as well as the employees—in particular, the unemployed; and those numbers continue to rise—it is exactly the wrong time to be cutting back on this indirect stimulus to our economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact that the government doesn't even know how many jobs will be lost when unemployment payments are cut at Christmas time is a concern. We cannot close our minds and our hearts to the suffering of those who are doing it tough. Also, it is going to be a massive benefit to businesses in our economy if we do this in a sensible way. What we need to be doing is giving a permanent increase to JobSeeker so that those who are unemployed, some for the first time in their lives, have some certainty going into Christmas. I certainly hope that is the case.</span>

                    </span>As we get closer to Christmas, Australians of all persuasions are relying on the coronavirus supplement for certainty. They need some form of certainty and support from the government, not a cruel cut. That's why Labor's seeking to amend this bill, the Social Services and Other Legislation Amendment (Coronavirus and Other Measures) Bill 2020, to ensure that the coronavirus supplement is extended until March next year, in line with JobKeeper, and to require the government to announce a permanent increase in the JobSeeker payment. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Many organisations have come out in support of a permanent increase in JobSeeker. Quite simply, you can't live off the old rate of JobSeeker, which roughly equated to about $40 a day. If you speak to someone that has had to try and survive on this measly payment, you find that it basically means that they find it extremely difficult to actually look for work, because most of their time is devoted to making ends meet and looking after family members, particularly if they're single parents. So it's the worst time for the government to be cutting support for people who've lost their jobs, whilst unemployment is still going up. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Department of Social Services has told Senate estimates that the number of people on unemployment payments will surge to 1.8 million by December, an increase of 300,000 over previous projections. It was also confirmed that the number of people forced to get by on unemployment benefits will be higher in 2024 than it was before the recession, with DSS projecting the average number to be 1.3 million in 2021, a million in 2022 and 900,000 in 2023-24. We know that the increase in unemployment comes as the Morrison government's been caught out inflating jobs figures associated with budget measures by nearly one million jobs. The Prime Minister's big promise on jobs, the so-called JobMaker, hasn't even lasted until the end of budget month. We know from the Treasury department that, out of the claimed 450,000 places, the hiring credit is only expected to support and create 45,000 new jobs. Out of the claimed 130,000 jobs from its technology road map, none are included in the budget. And, out of the claimed 80,000 direct and 300,000 indirect jobs from its manufacturing announcement, none are included in the budget. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's the deepest and most damaging recession in almost a century, and the Australian people deserve a government that creates jobs, not just headlines. This government has form when it comes to big announcements and all of the associated fanfare, but, 12 months after a program's been announced, we find out it hasn't delivered one job. There are a litany of programs across previous budgets delivered by this government where that is the case. They're all about the spin, all about the announcement, nothing about the follow-up. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The recent Anglicare Australian Jobs Availability Snapshot shows just how bleak the employment prospects are for many jobseekers, particularly with the government's underwhelming response to this recession. The report reveals more than 100 jobseekers are competing for every low skilled job vacancy across the nation. Many of the jobseekers in the jobs snapshot are older Australians, yet the government's Restart program, which it touts as its signature policy for the over-50s, has been an utter failure in getting older people back to work. Not only is it unsubscribed; 40 per cent of the workers under this program were out of work within three months. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If the Morrison government were serious about driving down the unemployment rate and kickstarting the recovery, it would not be excluding almost a million Australians over the age of 35 on unemployment payments from the new multibillion dollar Wage Subsidy Scheme. These Australians are rapidly approaching the JobSeeker Christmas cliff, with no certainty about the future of their support payments and how they'll find themselves competing with a subsidised younger workforce. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Leader of the Opposition, the Leader of the Labor Party, Anthony Albanese, has announced that a Labor government will train thousands of workers, and our next generation of tradies will come through our jobs and skills guarantee. We will build and manufacture in Australia through our National Rail Manufacturing Plan. We will cut childcare fees and put more money into the pockets of working families. We've called on the government to do more, right now, to create work for thousands of tradies in almost every suburb and town across the country by investing in projects that fast-track urgent repairs to social housing. I visited several social housing tenants in properties in the electorate that I represent, and many of those properties are in dire need of repair, and urgently. This is a program via which the government could provide support for tradies in every suburb and every town across the country. It could make sure they have the opportunity to work to provide much-needed upgrades to public assets—public infrastructure that provides people with a roof over their head and helps deal with problems in our society such as homelessness and couch surfing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the depths of this crisis, when the country needs a jobs plan, when the private sector is withdrawing investment and support for projects, when the country needs the support of government to fix some of the social issues we have, this government is sadly lacking. We have another grab bag of announcements and spin without any follow up-through policy that provides real support for jobs for people in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Decisions taken by the coalition mean that this recession will be deeper and longer than it has to be; that it will push more workers into the unemployment queues and jeopardise Australia's recovery. That, unfortunately, will be the hallmark of this government and a great shame for generations to come.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lingiari</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:36</span>):  I'm pleased to be able to stand up in this place and support this legislation, the Social Services and Other Legislation Amendment (Coronavirus and Other Measures) Bill 2020, but also, most importantly, to support the amendment moved by the member for Barton, the shadow minister. I'm referring now to the amendment which in substance wants us to look at the bill, understand the implications for people who are unemployed, and know that before Christmas we'll have 1.8 million people who will require income support because they're unemployed. We need to extend the $250 per fortnight coronavirus supplement at least until March, in line with JobKeeper. Most importantly, as the shadow minister has said, we need to create an obligation on the minister to announce a permanent increase to the base rate of the JobSeeker payment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've heard most of the contributions to this debate, and they've been very eloquent, ranging across the issues and the impact upon those people on income support who require additional income support in this nation, as the previous speaker just said. But we in this place need to understand what it means to live in a rural or remote part of this country, where there is a small area labour market with virtually no jobs to speak of and where you are dependent—absolutely, totally—on income support from the government. We need to understand that the additional income people have received as a result of the supplement to JobSeeker has meant that in many remote communities people have food on the table. In remote communities, many people live well below the poverty line, and to have the additional income into communities has meant, among other things, a substantial increase in the amount of food—good food—being sold by shops. Food sales at a major store in Maningrida, which is on the north-east Arnhem Land coast and has a population of around 3½ thousand people, increased by 50 per cent. Other retailers in remote communities saw food purchases increase by as much as 200 per cent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's a message here. There were some disruptive elements in relation to the additional income in some quarters, but most importantly, if you actually want to close the gap, you've got to make sure that people are healthy, and for people to be healthy they've got to have a decent amount of nutrition and a proper diet. To have that, they need to be able to purchase it, or catch it, but most probably go to a store, lay the money on the counter and purchase items which are nutritious. Where you've got a population which is comparatively young—in fact, extremely young by comparison to the general population—it's really important, as I'm sure members would appreciate, to ensure that young children in particular are well nourished.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Closing the gap means a lot of different things to a lot of different people, but to me it's very simple. It means giving people a healthy start in life to make sure they can live in a healthy and safe household, have the nutrition they require, get access to a good education and then to training and job opportunities thereafter and, importantly, live in safe and secure housing. Of course, that doesn't happen for most people in the remote communities of this country. Housing is overcrowded, unemployment is chronic and income support prior to the COVID supplementary payment was not nearly enough for people to survive properly. We know that in parts of northern Australia, in one area in particular—I can talk about Arnhem Land—around a third of the people who should be eligible to be on income support through the CDP are not getting income support. They've been alienated by the system. What that means is that they rely on the support of their families not only for income but, most importantly, as I've just described, for food. So the supplement has been very important in ensuring that these people have access to decent food.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have some understanding of it, but it is really difficult for those who have not visited these communities or who do not know how these communities work to understand why it is important, so absolutely important, to increase the JobSeeker payment. It's just absurd to be contemplating going back to $40 a day—how could that possibly be? Yet that's where we're heading. What we need to contemplate, and I've mentioned this in this chamber before, is the absurdity of the current Community Development Program. It needs to be replaced by something which is more workable and which is not a welfare scheme but a work scheme, such as the old CDEP, the Community Development Employment Program, about which I've spoken often, which is part-time work for part-time pay based on 15 hours of work a week.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We in this place have an obligation—I don't think we understand or appreciate how big that obligation is—to look after the most disadvantaged people in this country, the most disenfranchised people in this country, the people who are most on the margins in this country. We need to be able to fix it. We could fix it if we had a mind to fix it, but this government clearly does not have a mind to. There is a sense of frustration that exists in remote parts of this country because of the poor outcomes being accepted by this government. Instead of changing policy direction and understanding the importance of community based decision-making and community based control, they want to impose things. This sense of frustration is something which bedevils many people in this community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I finally want to complete my contribution by saying I don't think there's any comprehension at all by most people in this place around what small area labour markets actually look like, what it is to understand how discrete they might be in various parts of this country and how the relationship between these small area labour markets and the broader labour market is so distant. There is a lot to be done in this space. The most important things that can be done in the first instance are as the member for Barton, the shadow minister, has described: provide an obligation on this minister to announce a permanent increase in the base rate of the JobSeeker payment. When they do that, when they are contemplating what that might look like, look at the special needs of those Australians who live in rural, regional and remote places in this country, but most particularly the most disadvantaged of all, Aboriginal people who live in remote communities in the Northern Territory and elsewhere in northern Australia.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="83M" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms PLIBERSEK</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Sydney</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:46</span>):  I want to thank the member for Lingiari for an excellent argument for looking after people in remote communities much better than we do and supporting them much better than we do. I want to thank the member for Barton for this amendment and all of her terrific work on behalf of unemployed Australians. She is a wonderful person to have on your side.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This amendment, proposed by the member for Barton, would extend the coronavirus supplement to March, in line with the JobKeeker payment, and it would legislate for a permanent increase to the base rate of JobSeeker. I'm pretty sure we all agree in here that it's impossible to ask people to live on $40 a day again. I don't think there's anyone in this chamber who imagines that they could live on $40 a day and yet we are asking a million people to contemplate returning to living on $40 a day.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The case for the change proposed by the member for Barton is simple: it is not possible to live on $40 a day. The previous rate of Newstart is too low for people to live a dignified and healthy life. Of course, if someone can work they should work. If there is a job available and the person has the ability to do it of course they should do that work. But the simple reality at the moment is that we are in a recession. We have 13 people for every job vacancy. For entry-level jobs the competition is even harder. There are 106 people competing for every entry-level job in Australia. That tells you that despite the very best efforts of hundreds of thousands of people to look for work we will continue to see people locked out of the labour market. The government's own estimates are that 160,000 more people will be unemployed by Christmas, and what are we saying to those people? That they can look forward to life on $40 a day. On $40 a day it's pretty hard to afford the rent, eat a decent healthy diet, buy a train fare to the job interviews that you're trying to do, maybe find a clean shirt to wear to that interview. All of these things become out of reach and work together to keep people locked out of the labour market.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've had contact from many people in my own electorate saying that they are fearful. What keeps them awake at night is the fear of returning to life on $40 a day. The temporary increase has meant that they're finally eating a healthy diet, that they're able to put good food on the table for their kids, that they're able to buy the school shoes that they have been putting off buying for ages. A Glebe resident recently called my office worried sick about returning to that $40 a day. The same is true of people on disability support pensions, sole parents, age pensioners who are struggling with very low interest rates from banks. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have too many Australians who are living below the poverty line, and the sad thing, the tragic thing—I'd say the immoral thing—about this is that the government is prepared to rack up well over a trillion dollars of debt. They're prepared to spend that borrowed money on subsidising Clive Palmer's private jet so he can fly around Queensland, campaigning. They're prepared to spend borrowed money subsidising Clive Palmer's private jet, but they're not prepared to reassure people who are sick, unemployed, looking after kids on their own, too old to work or disabled that they've got their backs. They're prepared to spend money on JobKeeper payments for a company that pays an executive a bonus—not a salary, a bonus—of $2½ million, but they're not prepared to reassure poor, old, sick, isolated people that they've got their backs at a time like this—the worst recession that we've had since after the Second World War. They are not prepared to make sure that the most vulnerable Australians can live without the fear of poverty, but they are prepared to spend $30 million on a block of land worth less than $3 million. They are prepared to allow Australia Post executives to spend $20,000 on watches, but they're not prepared to make sure that the poorest people can put food on the table. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will just finish with this. There is a moral reason to do this. Australia is a country that does not have to choose poverty for its most vulnerable people. There is a moral reason to do this. But there's also a really good economic reason to do this. We know that people on low or limited incomes, if they get an extra 10 bucks in their pocket, will spend it—putting food on the table for their kids, buying shoes, paying the rent, making sure the electricity bill is paid. They will reinvest that money in the community, creating jobs for other Australians. We know that confidence in our economy was low before COVID-19 hit. We can supercharge aggregate demand in our economy by making sure the people on the lowest incomes have a bit more in their pocket to spend each week. That little bit extra in their pocket to spend creates work for other Australians. This is an investment in economic growth, as well as being the right thing to do morally. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Barton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:04</span>):  Today Labor moved an amendment to ensure greater support for those Australians who have been left behind by this government in its economic response to the recession. It is very disappointing that the government voted against these very reasonable and responsible increases for support. The amendment is modest and provides the government with the flexibility it needs to deliver the appropriate support for those Australians in these times. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister says 'we are all in this together', but our pensioners, both aged and DSP, and carers have are behind. He says we're all in this together, but 1.6 million Australians on unemployment support—including over 300,000 Australians aged over 55, who experience the greatest difficulty in finding work—are left uncertain as to what kind of support will be available to them beyond Christmas. If we're all in this together, why are almost one million Australians on unemployment benefits being excluded from the wage hire subsidy? If we're all in this together, the government should put its money where its rhetoric is and support the amendment moved by Labor. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">During these difficult and uncertain times, pensioners and carers have experienced increased costs in ensuring they remain safe and healthy. Yesterday, the Minister for Families and Social Services insisted to Senate estimates that healthcare costs have not increased. Well, let me say that I have been contacted—many people on this side have been—by many people who have said otherwise, with disability pensioners and carers very much a part of that. They do not need be lectured by this government about the very real challenges they are facing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unlike the government, Labor acknowledge that older Australians, people with disability and carers have experienced increased costs as a result of coronavirus. In June, we saw the release of a survey for People with Disability Australia, which found that nine in 10 people with disability experienced increased expenses due to the ongoing pandemic; 31 per cent reported increased spending on health care; and one in five reported increased spending on sanitising and hygiene products. Some have contacted me about the additional costs of having to get food delivered, especially during the height of the pandemic. Pensioners have been facing rising health, dental, energy and grocery bills for years. Average GP out-of-pocket costs alone have gone up 11 per cent under this government. Cruelly, the government froze the pension in September, which impacted on 2.5 million age pensioners. Labor's amendment will create an obligation on the minister to better support pensioners, including age pension, disability support pension and carer payment recipients. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This Christmas is going to be a very anxious and uncertain one for Australians on unemployment support. On 31 December, the coronavirus supplement is scheduled to come to an end. There are 1.6 million Australians on unemployment support, and yesterday we learnt through Senate estimates that that figure will rise to 1.8 million by the end of the year. Cruelly, this government is going to make them wait, excruciatingly, until a matter of weeks out from Christmas before they know what level of support will be available to them. It will simply leave many households without the ability to plan their budgets, which have become very strict and tight for rent, for food, for gas and for electricity, as the member for Sydney just said. It will be at a time when all Australians simply want to be able to spend quality time with loved ones, after what has been a tough year for so many. Many Australians on unemployment support are wondering why the government has extended JobKeeper to the end of March but plans to finish JobSeeker at the end of December. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This amendment simply rectifies that inequity. In the midst of this recession, and in the budget, the government has a once-in-a-generation opportunity to deliver lasting structural change. We urge the government—we absolutely urge the government—to grasp this opportunity and support this amendment. It is reasonable, it is fair and no-one can possibly disagree with it. I move the amendment circulated in my name:</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ALBANESE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grayndler</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Opposition</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:09</span>):  I second the amendment moved by the member for Barton. I do so as it is a practical initiative to make a difference to the lives of people who are doing it tough. There are many amendments, and sometimes in this place we move amendments just to make a point, to show a difference of values. This isn't one of those. This is the only way that you can get a real change in the income support for people, whether they be age pensioners, disability support pensioners, carers or, indeed, people who are on Newstart.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What the amendment moved by the member for Barton does, given the constraints that are there on money bills in this parliament and how you can move amendments that would have a fiscal impact, is say that the minister must consider what additional payments may be required by extending the COVID-19 supplement until 28 March 2021 at the amount of $250 a fortnight, in line with extensions to JobKeeper payments. Then it lists the potential recipients of this support: age pensioners, disability support pensioners and people who receive carer payment. Those measures are practical ones, because we know that if you are on one of those payments then you are currently subject to additional costs just to get by from day to day. You have to have in your budget, in your fortnightly payment—and I grew up in a household with my mother and our only income was the invalid pension every fortnight. My mum would go to Grace Bros and would have everything budgeted down to literally the last cent as a way of getting by. I've got to say that, when I was growing up, this wonderful hand sanitiser that has made a difference to people's lives wasn't something that was in the budget. I suspect it wasn't in age pensioners' budgets, but they have to get it because we know that elderly people are particularly susceptible to this virus. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This amendment is put forward by the member for Barton in good faith. Because we're not able to instruct the Treasurer on what to do on a money bill, it's asking him to give consideration to it. For the life of me, I can't understand why this government doesn't embrace the amendment and just give it support.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second element, of course, is the issue of JobSeeker. I've been asked as Leader of the Labor Party what I think the amount should be. One of the things that I have done is try to give the government space to move, not to put it in a position of having argy-bargy and playing politics with it but to say that we all know that $40 a day is not enough to survive on. They acknowledged that when they brought in the JobSeeker payments that effectively doubled the rate of Newstart allowance. I haven't said that it should remain at double the amount. That's not our position, and I wouldn't expect it to be the government's position. But we are saying to give people certainty and provide for an increase. You're going to announce in December what money people will have at the end of December, during Christmas and during that period. There are families that will be thinking now about whether they can afford to take their kids on the beach holiday that they might get to go on once a year for a week or so. There will be families who will be making that decision. We wouldn't ask any of us to be put in a position whereby we don't know at the beginning of December what income we are going to have at the end of December. We wouldn't ask people to be in that position, and the government shouldn't be putting people in that position either. We need a permanent increase to the base rate of the JobSeeker payment. I commend the amendment to the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms SHARKIE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mayo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:15</span>):  I rise to voice my support for this amendment. This amendment is critical. If we allow people to go back to the original Newstart rate, the original JobSeeker rate, we are indeed condemning people to poverty and hunger in this nation. I just had a quick look on realestate.com at rentals in my electorate. The cheapest two-bedroom unit available is $280 a week. If on 1 January we allow people to go back to the original JobSeeker rate, that's $282.85 a week. We just can't do that in Australia. We just shouldn't do that in Australia. And food has gone up immeasurably during the COVID crisis. Where you used to be able to perhaps spend $100 on food, people are spending at least $120 or $130 for that same shopping basket. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The $240-a-week coronavirus supplement is critical for individuals who are on JobSeeker and it's critical for families who are on a range of payments, but it's also really critical for small businesses in our electorates. If we want money in the economy, this is a very easy way to ensure that the whole payment goes directly into the hands of small businesses in our communities. People aren't spending their money on overseas holidays. They aren't spending their money on frivolous items. They are buying food. They are shopping locally, at the greengrocer, the butcher and the supermarket. I think that this amendment is incredibly important.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I meet too many pensioners and disability support pensioners in my electorate who are struggling. I would urge the government to look at the pension. When I have a pensioner that comes to me and they have broken dentures—their dentures are held together with superglue and they have ulcers in their mouth—there is something seriously wrong in this nation. We must ensure that older Australians are cared for better than is currently happening. I really urge the government to consider this amendment earnestly and to support the amendment in this place.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr WILKIE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Clark</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:17</span>):  I will support this amendment and I applaud the opposition for moving it. Could I suggest that this country needs a different approach to government pensions and payments? Rather than talking about the age pension, the disability support pension and unemployment benefits, I think we need to start talking about a living income, and our starting point needs to be: how much does someone need to live with dignity in this country? It clearly needs to be above the poverty line. There's no logical reason why someone who's unemployed, who may well be younger, with a family, should be getting paid less than someone on the age pension or the disability support pension. I think that all people who are relying on the government for income support should be paid a comparable amount and it should be above the poverty line.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I support the idea of maintaining the COVID-19 supplement, but I think we should go further. In fact, subparagraph (b) actually goes to that point. Everyone needs a fairer go at the moment. You can't live with dignity and pay market rent on the age pension, you can't live with dignity and pay market rent if you're on the disability support pension, and you certainly can't live with dignity and go about your life, maybe bring up a family, if you're unemployed and getting anything less than a similar amount of money. I encourage the government to start looking at pensions and payments in that light and to turn its mind to the whole idea of a living income that all people who need income support in this country receive and benefit from. I think that's a much better approach.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If the government won't do that then—for heaven's sake—at least make sure that people who are unemployed get a fair deal, and not only that they get a fair deal eventually but that they have some certainty between now and then. I think it's quite cruel for the government to be saying, 'Well, yes, we do have an intention for unemployment benefits to be above $40 a day after 31 December.' That doesn't give enough comfort to someone who is two months out from that. They don't know whether they are going to get $41, $42, $60 or $80 a day. They don't know. They are planning now. I think it is not intentional cruelty by the government, but it is cruelty nonetheless that people just don't know what the future holds. I think we have got a good enough sense of the economic situation now and what it will be over the next couple of months that the government can give more certainty.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It would a very big thing for the government to do—to actually come in and support this amendment. I believe the opposition have moved it in good faith. It would give great comfort to people who are bearing down on 31 December and the prospect of a big cut in their household income. It would give some comfort to people on the age pension and the disability pension. As the Leader of the Opposition so beautifully put, when he was a child, his mum didn't have to worry about buying hand sanitiser. Well, someone who is on a pension these days does have to buy hand sanitiser and all sorts of other things, and the rate of bulk-billing has gone down in real terms. So I will support the amendment, I encourage the government to support the amendment and I applaud the opposition for moving it.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms STEGGALL</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Warringah</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:21</span>):  I thank the member for Barton for moving this amendment to the Social Services and Other Legislation Amendment (Coronavirus and Other Measures) Bill 2020, and I echo some of the sentiments that have been made in this place. I do believe this is an amendment moved in good faith. We as parliamentarians do have a duty to offer as much security or reassurance to those more vulnerable in our society as we possibly can. This has been an incredible year. 2020 has been incredibly challenging for so many of the population. These support payments and measures—and I have congratulated the government on having done JobKeeper and JobSeeker—have made such a difference for those more vulnerable and for people who have found themselves without employment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But we need to be very focused. Those on JobSeeker are incredibly vulnerable. We can't have a situation of going back to the previous rate. During the 2019 election, I supported the Raise the Rate campaign. It was supported by many in this place. I feel that it is really an obstinate reluctance to acknowledge the inevitable and to not give security and some reassurance to those who desperately need to hear it by extending JobSeeker and the supplement and having a permanent recognition of where that rate needs to be so people can meaningfully bridge the gap between employment opportunities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If we want people to go from having lost their employment to new employment, they need to be in a position where they actually can get themselves on transport to job interviews. They need to be able to be dressed for job interviews. They need to have a home to live in before going to job interviews. You can't have a situation where they are pushed into such levels of desperation and of not being able to make ends meet that they have no ability to get to job interviews and find employment. That has to be the ideal and the goal that we have in this place—assisting people in our community needing to find employment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have to be very real about the people we are talking about. It's often misrepresented, I would say. We used to have, I believe, under Prime Minister Howard, a whole campaign around 'dole bludgers'. This is not at all what we are talking about. It is insulting to those people. We know women over 55 have the highest rate of homelessness. They are the people in our population who have the highest rate of needing to rely on support—JobSeeker or Newstart, as it was—to get from one situation of employment to the next. Unfortunately, that period is not just a matter of a couple of months. It is sadly a longer period than that. They need to have support that is actually liveable in the meantime. If not, what we are doing and what we are condoning is pushing people into poverty and homelessness, and that is surely not the Australia that we all want to stand for.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So I thank the member for this amendment. I urge the government to hear it. You have taken the right steps during this pandemic. It is time to give some reassurance to those who are desperate to know how they are going to make ends meet. Please consider extending the additional economic support payments in relation to the JobSeeker and coronavirus payments. As is indicated in this amendment, those vulnerable people need our support. I urge the government to do this. It is the right thing to do. Put political games aside and focus on the more-vulnerable.</span>

These are 32,000 Australians whose only option is to empty their bank account to pay exorbitant prices for commercial flights home—flights that are continually cancelled and rescheduled with little notice. All the while, they've watched citizens of other countries be rescued by their governments.</span>

Unable to return home, Raul has lost his job, been evicted from his home and had his possessions sold by his landlord. He's managed to secure a flight home so that he can rebuild his life, but that flight will not leave until January 2021. Until then, Raul has no family or friends he can rely on for support; instead, he's surviving through the goodwill of strangers. Representations made to Minister Payne in September are still awaiting a response.</span>

Musa, from Hinchinbrook, is stuck in Sudan, where his regular medication is not available. Meanwhile, it seems that mates of this government can come and go as they please. Once again, I call on this government to do something for our people who have been left overseas with no money and no prospects and to bring them home as soon as possible.</span>

Denis has worked with me to highlight why the Tiaro bypass should be done right first time and why it should be four lanes. We want heavy industry and manufacturing in Maryborough to provide local jobs, but to achieve that vision we need a highway with the capacity to carry machinery, products and people as quickly—and, most importantly, safely—as possible. That's why everyone who has signed Denis Chapman's petition rejects the inferior two-lane proposal that the Queensland government has put forward and instead calls on us to support a four-lane Tiaro bypass. A four-lane divided bypass will safely move motor vehicles—trucks, caravans and wide loads—into the future so all road users will know that highway will be as safe as possible. Deb Frecklington's LNP team and Denis Chapman have committed to four-lane the Bruce Highway, including the Tiaro bypass.</span>

I will send it to the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport and Regional Development for his consideration and response. If you live in Maryborough and you want a four-lane bypass around Tiaro, vote for the LNP's Denis Chapman.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Calwell</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:34</span>):  [by video link] I want to congratulate Val Karaitiana, the principal of Dallas Brooks Community Primary School, on receiving this year's Robert Kumar Community Award for outstanding contributions to the Hume community. The award is presented annually by Banksia Gardens Community Services. Only last week, this school was one of two in Melbourne's north that was forced to close for days as a result of the most recent COVID-19 cluster. That was just another challenge facing this school.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Not one to be deterred, Val Karaitiana's approach is to focus on opportunities for her students and their families. Val Karaitiana first arrived at the school in 1990 as a physical education teacher. Now under her leadership the school offers classes and activities for parents as well as playgroups in the community hub. During the pandemic, the school has provided food parcels and IT support for students and their families.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">By bringing child care and adult education on site Val argues the school helps parents gain employment opportunities and get a deeper appreciation of education for both themselves and children. Val believes strongly in supporting her students and in needing to understand the poverty and behaviour of the families in order to allow families to go forwards. Congratulations, Val Karaitiana. Our local community is very proud of you.</span>

I was pleased to see the Morrison government's $1.5 billion investment in the budget towards the Modern Manufacturing Strategy and its focus on areas where the Sunshine Coast is already strong, like food and beverages, medical products and defence.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I believe the Sunshine Coast has a terrific opportunity to take advantage of this investment and I'm determined to help make the most of it. I'm beginning next week by hosting a Fisher manufacturing forum. This event will feature a presentation from a representative of AusIndustry on the support for manufacturing provided by the Morrison government, and I'll interview a panel of local business leaders to discuss the present and future of manufacturing on the Sunshine Coast. My experts will include Will Shrapnel of HeliMods, Naomi Elliott of Concept Labs and Matt Hepburn and Christen McGarry of Your Mates Brewing—I'm sure everyone will be pleased to hear from them. I am very grateful to all of these well-known local business leaders for taking part. The event will take place on Wednesday 4 November at 2 pm at venue 114 at Bokarina. If any Fisher residents are interested in attending, they should contact my office for information.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fraser</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:38</span>):  [by video link] Much of the commentary on the recent budget has focused on the $214 billion fiscal deficit, but the deficit that should be of greatest concern to Australia is the deficit in vision. This government has racked up a trillion dollars of debt, but no-one is the wiser as to how that will help this country navigate its major challenges. Even before COVID-19 Australia had chronically high unemployment and underemployment, totalling almost 20 per cent in some regions. But there's no plan for fixing unemployment growth in the sea of red.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Even before COVID Australia had no plan for emissions reduction and was falling behind comparable economies. The last budget didn't fix that. Even before COVID-19, wages had stalled for too many, while the cost of living rose. The last budget offered no hope for bridging that gap.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Out of World War II Australia built important social protections and invested in housing. Out of the 1990s recession Australia built a world-class superannuation system. If you want to see vision, you need to look at Anthony Albanese's budget reply for productivity growth and participation growth through long overdue reform to child care, for jobs in manufacturing and for much-needed investment in transmission. This budget has a policy and vision deficit that this country can ill afford.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mallee</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:39</span>):  On Australia Day in 2019, Scott Umback, the picture of health and fitness and father of two young boys, lost his life to an undiagnosed and completely unexpected heart condition. He was a leader in the Mildura community and the husband of Katrina, who met with me recently. Scott was never offered an angiogram, which could have diagnosed his condition. The reason? The service is not available in Mildura. His only option would have been to travel 600 kilometres to Melbourne. Ever since this tragedy occurred, Katrina has devoted herself to promoting heart health and exploring the possibility of establishing a new cardiac service in Mildura. I'm impressed by her resolve and commitment to make sure others do not lose a loved one in this preventable way, as she has. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Access to high-quality health care in regional and rural areas has always been a key and high priority for me. It has been a pleasure and is a pleasure to support Katrina in her goal to establish in Mildura a catheterisation laboratory with an angiogram service. I've engaged local experts from the public and private hospitals, and got the advice of an interventional cardiologist from Melbourne. I've also taken this need to the minister for regional services, Mark Coulton. I look forward to continuing to work with Katrina to address this essential healthcare need in our region.</span>

That might be something like getting out of bed in the morning or assisting them with simple acts that we do every day, like getting dressed in the morning. It was intended to give dignity and assistance to those that needed it, and that was the intention and the commitment of the then Labor government. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, under this Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government, that hasn't been the case. I'm contacted every day by constituents with disabilities, frustrated by the constant blockages and sheer pushback that they receive for simply wanting to access help to make their lives easier—people like Tracy, who has severe disability and needs 24-hour care, with a carer to stay with her overnight. She's got a one-bedroom unit. She needs to be funded for a two-bedroom unit. They found a two-bedroom unit through UnitingCare, but the NDIS will not fund it. They say she's only eligible for one room. Where is the carer meant to sleep—on the floor, on the couch or maybe in the bathroom?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This Liberal government last year ripped $4.6 billion out of the NDIS to prop up a budget surplus that didn't eventuate. Now, to add insult to injury, the government wants to bring in independent assessors, which everyone who is contacting me opposes. </span>

Many local businesses in my electorate benefited from these productions, with cast, crew and stars dining out and shopping daily.

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Warringah</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:44</span>):  After listening to the Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction's statement to the House this morning on Australia's energy future, I am left thinking that he and the Morrison government really don't understand how the business sector plans for the future. All sectors are crying out for policy certainty when it comes to emissions reduction. So I thought I'd explain what, clearly, our trading partners, such as the UK, Germany and Japan, understand: net zero by 2050 makes economic sense. Putting in place the legislative framework to reach net zero by 2050 focuses investment, which then develops more low-emissions technologies and accelerates emissions reduction. As technology develops emission reduction budgets can get more and more ambitious. That's why we need to start locking in net zero by 2050.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the conservative British Prime Minister reminded the Prime Minister, 'We have to be bold,' and he is in a perfect position to provide us with advice about emissions reduction. The UK passed the Climate Change Act 12 years ago and they've been reaping the rewards. In the meantime Australia has no set goal, no clear policy, while other countries are simply getting on with it. We're being left behind and Australian business and the Australian people deserve better. That's why I will be tabling the Climate Change Bill on 9 November. I urge all those who claim to care about climate change and emission reduction to get on board.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Goldstein</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:45</span>):  Goldstein is a strong community because of the passion and commitment of young residents like Sarah who take action to support others. Victorians have done it tough during COVID-19 and residents of Goldstein are no exception. Sarah became worried about the impact of food hoarding early in the pandemic, particularly its impact on vulnerable households and the risk of waste where food was purchased but was not consumed. After contacting the Goldstein office, we connected Sarah with a local support charity BayCISS, which has organised the distribution of donated food to individuals and families in need over many years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Working with BayCISS Sarah devised a solution whereby people's excess groceries could be converted into a food bank for those people struggling to buy essentials at a critical time. Sarah coordinated with local households and gathered a whole car load of supplies, which has since been redistributed by BayCISS. Sarah's initiative has helped soften the impact of the COVID recession for many vulnerable households and she's a model to us all. Congratulations, Sarah, on the success of the initiative that you have taken. Thank you for your passion and your commitment to our community. It's the efforts of people like you, Sarah, that make our country a strong and successful nation.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Eden-Monaro</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:47</span>):  More than a month ago the SBS signal in the town of Bermagui on the far south coast of New South Wales dropped out. Overnight more than 1,500 people lost access to SBS and NITV without any warning and not much explanation as to why. My office was inundated by residents who were extremely concerned and frustrated by this development. The decision was made by the company maintaining the transmitter that it simply could not afford to keep up with the cost of repairs. The maintenance of these sites had been provided by commercial providers at their own cost, free of charge to SBS and ABC, since the transition to digital broadcasting over the last 10 years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Bermagui site is just the beginning. There are five other sites that could soon lose their ABC and SBS broadcast services, including Batlow, Bungendore, Dalmeny, Merimbula and Tumbarumba. Regional communities rely heavily on the ABC and SBS, including for emergency broadcasting. This is a matter of safety. What did the government say? Nothing. I wrote to the communications minister a month ago and haven't heard a single word back. Rather than act to avoid this sort of mess, we've heard nothing. These are same public broadcasters that had their funding savagely slashed. This is simply not good enough and regional Australians deserve better from this government.</span>

Country shows bring communities together. They play a vital role in our communities by showcasing local talent, providing a form of entertainment and offering goods and produce to buy. Agricultural shows in particular also offer an opportunity to showcase new and innovative agricultural equipment, technology and local produce.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Throughout this COVID year country shows have been on hold as our communities isolated themselves to reduce the risk of spreading COVID. As that risk decreases, I was pleased to see two communities in my electorate have opened their doors and gone full steam ahead with their country shows. The Kojonup Agricultural Show was held on 17th of this month and the 129th Katanning agricultural show was held last Saturday. While I couldn't get to them myself, due to being stuck here in Canberra, I had stalls at both shows, and my state government colleagues and candidates were there flying the flag. I'm told both these events were a resounding success and attended by people from all over Western Australia, which is a testament to the importance of these beloved shows to their communities and the surrounding districts. Katanning Agricultural Society president Jill Kowald said that with the date set for 24 October, when restrictions were expected to ease, the society made the call to soldier on with strict hygiene and social distancing. I'm so proud that the people of my home town aren't hiding under the doona, and I'm grateful that my 94-year-old mum had a much-needed day out to meet up with her many, many friends.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gilmore</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:49</span>):  Since the bushfires in my electorate on the New South Wales South Coast we have seen many things from this government. We've seen endless flashy announcements with no substance. We've seen promise after promise on clean-up funding support and more promises broken. The latest example is the government's supposedly new Bushfire Community Recovery and Resilience Fund, announced just this month. It turns out it's a rebadged version of the Local Economic Recovery and Complementary Projects Fund announced five months ago but now with the goalposts changed and no money hitting the ground until at least next year. I suppose it shouldn't come as a surprise that the government has chosen to delay the release of the bushfire royal commission's final report. They received it yesterday but they won't release it until Friday. Why? In our community we still have people waiting for the clean-up the government promised. We have dozens of families concerned about what will happen when their temporary accommodation runs out in December. We have community groups who want to prepare for the bushfire season that is already upon us. And we have mental health programs through the Shoalhaven Women's Health Centre that are at risk of closure. Our community cannot afford to wait. We deserve better.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Longman</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:51</span>):  Longman is home to some fantastic sporting clubs that have been around for many years, but there is no escaping the fact that, as time goes on, the facilities these clubs have relied on for many years are beginning to age, just like some of their athletes. The Caboolture touch and rugby union clubs currently occupy a clubhouse that is over 30 years old. It has issues with accessibility such that, under new building standards, the building would not be approved. They need to be addressed. Facilities at the Petersen Road Sports Ground cater to around 1,680 players between the two clubs. The clubs also run clinics for kids during the day during school holidays, so it's fair to say these facilities get some use. In fact, they see more than 5,000 people a week in peak times, including players, their families, other spectators and officials.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The clubs, under the umbrella of Caboolture Sports Club, have been working for some time to secure funding for redevelopment of the facility. They have plans for a $4 million overhaul of the entire Petersen Road sports precinct. This includes opening it up to more non-sporting groups to use for meetings and other activities. Caboolture Sports Club and Moreton Bay Regional Council have already pledged partial funding for this project. I too support this redevelopment and look forward to working hard in Canberra to put forward a case to secure the federal funding needed to get this jointly funded project started.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moreton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:52</span>):  The LNP Senator Scarr used taxpayer funds to condemn Queensland Labor for not committing to build the Coopers Plains rail crossing. Then the Labor member for Toohey, Peter Russo, and the Minister for Transport and Main Roads, Mark Bailey, announced funding to get the job done. The LNP candidate for Toohey mustn't want to fix the road—there's nothing on his webpage. However, the dude is very supportive of another road intersection getting an upgrade, publicly thanking the federal member for Bonner, but not me, for the Rochedale roundabout, which isn't even in Toohey. Maybe Senator Scarr should lobby his own LNP candidate to see if he will support fixing a crossing the Deputy Prime Minister told me 464 days ago, right here, that he'd come visit. But the Toohey dude isn't actually the weirdest LNP state candidate in Moreton. I don't know the candidate in Stretton, as he doesn't live anywhere near the electorate, and I don't know what he did wrong, but the Moreton young LNP put out a tweet last night that reads:</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">North Sydney</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:54</span>):  This week Melburnians have celebrated being able to leave their homes, yet there are still thousands of Victorians stuck overseas trying to actually get home. In fact, something like 8,000 Victorians are overseas wanting to return to Australia, and over 1,500 of these are vulnerable. I raise this issue because all of us should feel for every Australian who remains unable to return to their own country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also raise this because every day that Melbourne remains closed to arrivals is a day that residents of my own electorate and in my own state are deprived of more opportunities to secure flights. The exclusion of Victoria from the national system is acting as a handbrake on getting Aussies back. Today's announcement by the Premier of Victoria that they will move to allow international arrivals and quarantine at some point towards the end of November is a welcome step, but it's not enough. Surely, with living and breathing examples of how to run a successful hotel quarantine system in every other state of the federation, the Victorian government could have emulated those systems. Waiting for its inquiry to conclude does not stack up and is an incredible vote of no confidence by the Premier in the capacity of his own government. Even a firm start date would allow airlines to plan and Australians to book, knowing there is some hope of ending the tortuous uncertainty they have faced. We need Victoria open to arrivals if we are to make the aspiration of getting Australians home by Christmas a reality, and I plead with the Premier to make that so.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macquarie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:55</span>):  Right now there's a 1,000 page report sitting on someone's desk, probably on several ministerial desks. It's the report of the royal commission into last summer's bushfires. It's beyond me why it wasn't automatically released. It was delivered yesterday. Why haven't we seen it immediately? It's a report that's meant to inform decisions being made already for the present bushfire season. There are 80 recommendations the commission believes can improve the way bushfire seasons are managed—the lessons learnt: the lessons that might improve the preparation, the campaign, the recovery, the things government can do differently, the things this government can do better. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yet, for some reason, the Prime Minister decides he should just sit on the report till tomorrow afternoon, Friday afternoon, the classic take-out-the-trash time when the government delivers the reports or the announcements it really doesn't want us to look at. There can only be two reasons. One is he wants time to spin it. The other is that it just isn't a priority. Both of those are disrespectful. It's disrespectful to the families of the people who died in last season's fires. It's disrespectful to the people who lost their homes. It's disrespectful to the people who lost property and still have uncleared land. It's disrespectful to the people who fought the fires and those who are already out fighting this season's fires. The report should be released today. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bennelong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:57</span>):  COVID has been tough on everyone this year, but particularly hard on the more vulnerable. Thankfully in Bennelong we have many hardworking and caring organisations to make sure that nobody is neglected. Christian Community Aid is a wonderful local organisation that has operated in Bennelong and the surrounding area since 1965. They provide a huge number of services, including community learning, home delivered meals and community support. During the restrictions imposed by COVID and the other associated impacts on our community, CCA has been integral to ensuring that our most vulnerable are adequately supported and cared for. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the past few months I have had the good fortune of being a drop-off point for the Parramatta Women's Shelter, which is a fantastic organisation that caters for women seeking refuge in both Bennelong and the surrounding areas of Parramatta. The generosity of members of our community is astounding, especially during the height of COVID, when the shelter was under acute stress and in need of resources. Time and again I would come into my office and find our drop-off box overflowing with donations, including at one point the donation to the shelter of an entire furniture set. I thank the shelter and its fantastic staff for all of their endless acts of kindness. I thank these organisations and everyone who has helped those in need. It has been a wonderful time for Bennelong. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kingsford Smith</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:58</span>):  I have a question, Prime Minister: how do you think the 2½ thousand Qantas workers—many of whom live in your electorate and are having their jobs dismissed by Qantas, having them replaced by a foreign corporation on lower wages and conditions—feel about your government handing out tens of thousands of taxpayers' dollars to the operators of private jet companies while they lose their jobs? How do you think the 4½ thousand dnata workers who've been denied JobKeeper by your government feel about your government handing out tens of thousands of dollars to Clive Palmer, Crown casino and the Leppington Pastoral Company whilst they are put on the unemployment queues? I'll tell you how they feel. They are outraged and they are sick of your government's deceit and duplicity. </span>

You've been up in Queensland saying that you support coalminers and then your government actively intervenes in the WorkPac case against coalminers to deny them access to permanent employment. It's a disgrace, and the sooner the Australian public work you out, mate, the better.</span>

He recovered pretty quickly, and I've spoken with Bernadette, who is with him in hospital, where he will stay overnight for further tests. I thank Dr Freelander, who happened to be in the chair in the Federation Chamber at the time; Dr Gillepsie, who rushed up to the Federation Chamber to provide assistance; and all those members on both sides who acted with care and compassion. I thank the Prime Minister for his call to me about Chris's health. He is in good spirits, and we all wish him a very speedy recovery. I say to the Chief Opposition Whip: if you want leave, you should just ask for it. There are easier ways to get it than what occurred this morning. I look forward to him being back in this chamber in good health.</span>

She's been a welcome person around this place for many, many years. She is well known to many of our partners, spouses, wives and husbands in this place, and she has played an active role in supporting and counselling on so many other occasions the spouses and partners of people in this place. Our prayers are with you, Bernadette, and with Nicholas, Jonathan and Elizabeth. I thank the Leader of the Opposition for the update. We wish you all the best, Chris.

In March the Prime Minister said the government had been working on personal protective equipment for months.

Can the Prime Minister confirm that between March and August this year his government received 2,865 PPE requests from aged-care providers but rejected over half of them, leaving residents and frontline workers more vulnerable as a result?</span>

The advice that I have is that the government during this year has acquired over 500 million masks in what has been a global shortage. At a time of extreme global shortage and a spike in demand, we've been able to maintain that airbridge for the nation as well as engage in domestic production. That has seen 78 million masks dispatched from the National Medical Stockpile, according to the rules of the National Medical Stockpile.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With regard specifically to aged care, the National Medical Stockpile has provided aged-care facilities with approximately 18 million masks, five million gowns, 11 million gloves, four million goggles and face shields, 90,000 bottles of hand sanitiser and 160,000 clinical waste bags. The time frame that I have is that between 18 February 2020 and 20 October 2020 the Department of Health responded to 1,769 requests for PPE with dispatches and, very significantly, all requests from providers managing a COVID outbreak were approved. In addition to that, all requests for assistance outside of outbreaks where aged-care providers could not source PPE to meet clinical need—that is, to manage some form of outbreak or similar item—were met. So 100 per cent of the complying requests were met according to the terms of the National Medical Stockpile and there are no cases we are aware of where any complying request was not met. We did this on the basis of the medical advice and we did this on the basis of the advice of the AHPPC, the medical expert panel which has guided Australia through this.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The provision of personal protective equipment has been one of the most significant and important achievements of this government. We have seen the outbreaks. We have seen the collapse across Italy, Spain and France. We have seen the shortages in New York and the United Kingdom in relation to PPE. Against that background, these provisions have been consistent. They have been done on the basis of rules set by the medical experts and we have met all of those requests, which met those requirements.</span>

I thank him for his leadership in his local community as we move through this most difficult of years. At this time last year a global pandemic is something that none of us would have imagined over the course of this year. This would have been our experience all across the country, let alone all around the world. It is a global pandemic that has caused harm on a scale almost imaginable around the world. Here in Australia the impacts have been very significant, and that is what has always guided our response. It is a global pandemic but with very local effects, very local impacts and a very Australian response that is uniquely suited to Australia's circumstances. This response began with understanding the nature of this threat. Of course, there were the severe and significant health impacts of this pandemic. At the start of the pandemic there were many unknowns about how great the health risks were.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But not only did we understand that the pandemic would have significant health impacts; we knew that, equally, there would be significant economic impacts as well. A global pandemic had the very strong likelihood, even at those early stages when little was known, of leading to a pandemic recession. Indeed, that is what occurred. And so, from the start, we always said there were twin crises to address here, and that is what framed our response from the very beginning. We activated the pandemic plan right at the start of the year—a pandemic plan that had been prepared many years ago for these very purposes; a pandemic plan that called the pandemic before the World Health Organization had made that same call. We pulled together the National Security Committee immediately to guide the response. We drew on the expert advisers at both state and federal levels as we framed the responses for the months ahead. We drew on a world-class health system right around the country—a health system that has stood up to the challenge that has been placed upon this country by this pandemic.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We pulled together our federation in a way that has never been seen in this country, through the national cabinet. And that national cabinet, supported by a series of other working groups on everything from working on regional Australia to health impacts and the skills needs of Australians, working together as a federation, has come together on 30 occasions in just over seven months. We've used the strong balance sheet that we had built up coming into this crisis to extend the largest lifeline to livelihoods and lives this country has ever seen. This has served the country well, and this approach will continue to serve our country well.</span>

                  </a>  To the point of order, the question goes directly to the use of taxpayer money. It refers to the government program where taxpayer money would be coming from, and asks whether or not it's being used for that purpose of electioneering in Queensland. The question is about the payment of taxpayer money. </span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberInterjecting">Mr Porter:</span>
                  </a>  With respect to the second part of the question, which spoke to what was described as an individual's 'electioneering' in Queensland, that is impossible—literally impossible—for the minister to know. What a person does in a place is surely outside any possibility of the minister knowing, and outside his portfolio. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span class="HPS-OfficeInterjecting">The SPEAKER:</span>  I will rule on this now, and try and rule more clearly, perhaps. If it involves a minister's responsibilities—and clearly it's a program with taxpayers' funds, so it does involve the minister's responsibility—the question can be asked. Without denigrating the question, it can be entirely unreasonable for a minister to carry that knowledge. But, since I have been pushed on it, that is why we have questions without notice that can be answered on the spot or can be taken on notice. It was a very common practice 40 or 50 years ago. It's less common today. Otherwise, you wouldn't have that capacity, and whole swathes of questions would be ruled out of order. So the question is in order. I was worried about another aspect of it, which is the Queensland election having nothing to do with us, but I think there is that linkage there with taxpayers' money and that the question's in order. </span>

Thank you, member for Cowper—a fantastic question well asked, and about to be well answered!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our budget was a budget for the regions. We delivered a plan and a pathway which positions Australia to recover and grow from what has been a once-in-a-lifetime event. This pandemic has hit our nation hard and in particular has hit our regions hard, but our regions are strong; people in the regions are tough. Our investment extends to every one of the 537 local government areas across the nation. The Local Roads and Community Infrastructure Program delivers benefit to every council, no matter where it is. These communities are very well represented by the member for Cowper. These communities are receiving $15.4 million to kickstart local projects such as the V-Wall precinct upgrade, which is having concrete poured right now by Nambucca Valley Council. It is a project made possible through $310,000 granted under the program. This is just one of 2,100 projects already approved to date.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are getting on with not just small projects such as that, which make such a difference—local workers on the ground, local procurement—but also large projects. Beginning construction in 2015, NorthConnex is a transformational project. It is opening this Saturday, linking the M1 and M2 motorways via a three-lane tunnel under Pennant Hills Road. We've put in $412.3 million. Those numbers are big, but what they don't tell is the story that this project will bypass 21 sets of traffic lights between the motorways. It's diverting 5,000 heavy vehicles per day which use Pennant Hills Road, reducing operating costs and boosting productivity for freight operators such as Jim Pearson Transport, which started in the member's electorate in Port Macquarie. It's been operating since 1978. Jim Pearson Jr had this to say: 'NorthConnex brings long-awaited relief for heavy road transport and the general user. Pennant Hills Road has not been adequate or safe for decades. The new route will remove stress from drivers, provide greater safety, less wear and tear on vehicles and considerable fuel savings. It will benefit all users.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to acknowledge each member in this place who contributed to that project, but it took a Liberal-Nationals government to get on and build it. That is going to be such a great project for Sydney but also for all users of that particular road. That's what we're getting on with—we're building roads, we're building rail, we're building a better future for Australia. Through the COVID recovery, that's what we're doing—getting on with the job.</span>

Yesterday I, along with others in this place, received a petition from the Game Over campaign, championed by Craig Foster and Sonny Bill Williams with Amnesty International. The petition calls on you to accept the New Zealand offer to take 150 asylum seekers each year from Manus Island and Papua New Guinea. This offer has been on the table for several years now, and all the refugees could have been resettled in New Zealand by now. You have opposed, just today, a permanent increase to the old Newstart for our most vulnerable, we are in a recession, yet you are prepared to pay an estimated cost of $573,000 per year, per person in offshore detention. This is obscene. Prime Minister, will you commit to accepting the New Zealand offer without delay? <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a>  The member for Moreton was part of the government when people sadly, tragically, drowned at sea, and boats arrived. We have worked very hard, day and night, to get people off. In the case of Manus, we've closed the centre there, as you'd be aware, Mr Speaker. There are people who are living within PNG at the moment; many of them have settled there, with jobs et cetera. In the case of Nauru, as I recall, the latest advice is that the number there is down to 134 people. I would be very happy to bring those people off Nauru tomorrow, but I need to manage it in a way, as we've said before, that we don't see new boat arrivals—because it's actually the policy of both the government and the opposition that, if a new boat arrived tomorrow, those people would go to Nauru. That's the policy of both the Labor Party and the Liberal Party. And we don't want that because, as we know, many of those boats don't make it, and people drown. On my watch, nobody has drowned at sea, and I've not sent a single person to Manus or Nauru. I got all of the children out of detention. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have not ruled out an arrangement with New Zealand. I've said that, and I've been very clear. We will work with New Zealand, as we do on many, many issues. We've worked very closely with the United States, to the credit of previous Prime Minister Turnbull. The negotiations with President Trump resulted in an arrangement for about 1,200 or 1,250 people, potentially, to go from Manus and Nauru to the United States. That number is in the vicinity of 850 or 900, which has been a remarkable outcome, and we will get people off as quickly as possible. But we do know that, up in Indonesia, Sri Lanka and Vietnam at the moment, there are people smugglers who are attempting to put syndicates together. They are very sophisticated in messaging out, through social media, every word that I say, that the Prime Minister says or that those opposite say. They would take money from those innocent men, women and children tomorrow, not caring whether or not those people would get to Australia. And at the same time, over this period, we have been able to bring more migrants into our country through the Refugee and Humanitarian Program.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kooyong</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Treasurer</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:22</span>):  I thank the member for Wentworth for his question and acknowledge he was a distinguished diplomat for Australia and has extensive experience in the private sector as a champion for the technology transition underway—and I congratulate the member for Wentworth on winning the seat of Wentworth again for the coalition. He, like others on this side of the House, understands that Australia has faced a once-in-a-century pandemic, and in response the Morrison government has provided economic support like none other—the JobKeeper program; the JobSeeker program; the cash flow boost; and $750 payments to pensioners, carers and others on income support. In total, when you include balance sheet support and direct fiscal economic support, that's $507 billion, or around 26 per cent of GDP, and our support has helped save 700,000 jobs.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The economic recovery is now underway. There were 446,000 jobs created over the last four months, 60 per cent of which went to women and 40 per cent of which went to young people. Consumer confidence, now up eight weeks in a row, is back to the level it was in early March. Consumer sentiment is up 11.9 per cent in this month—the single biggest increase in a budget month since the series first began in 1974. And I can inform the House that today the NAB business survey on business conditions was out, and it was up for the September quarter by 22 points, up across all sectors, and particularly strong in manufacturing, in retail and in transport.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I had the opportunity to visit the member for Wentworth's electorate and to see firsthand the economic recovery underway. We went to the Blair Street cafe in Bondi, and it was thriving. There were people at the cafe like you haven't seen in months. He had previously used JobKeeper to support his staff, but now, with the customers coming back, he is transitioning off JobKeeper. This is the economic recovery that is now being undertaken across the country as a result of the virus being suppressed, the jobs coming back and the economic support from the Morrison government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the budget there were additional measures like tax cuts for more than 11½ million people, infrastructure projects being brought forward, skills and training support for apprentices and the JobMaker hiring credit. On this side of the House we're in favour of creating more jobs, and that is what our record shows.</span>

He pointed out that we want our companies to be profitable. But JobKeeper had a specific test, and the JobKeeper test was about turnover reductions. It was about turnover reductions, and businesses across Australia have been benefitting from JobKeeper and keeping people employed. When it comes to whether or not businesses have complied with that test, they are matters for the ATO. They will be followed up. But, when it comes to JobKeeper, it's been a very successful program, supporting more than 3½ million Australian workers.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we speak today, 44.4 million people have been diagnosed with COVID, 1.17 million people have officially lost their lives and no doubt the figures are greater. In two weeks when the parliament meets again, it's likely that those numbers will be over 50 million cases and 1¼ million lives lost. The disease is progressing at a faster rate than ever before, with eight consecutive days of over 400,000 cases and, in the last 24 hours, over 500,000 cases. That means that the challenge the world is facing is growing.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Against that background, Australia has had seven cases within the community in the last 24 hours—500,000 as opposed to seven. What that means is that Australia's unique approach has been deeply, fundamentally important in protecting lives and saving lives here. As the <span style="font-style:italic;">Medical Journal of Australia</span> indicated, Australia's approach—our approach—has helped save over 16,000 lives compared with the United Kingdom. But, more than that, what we did was over a long period of time. In 2014 we worked with the COAG Health Council to establish a communicable diseases framework for Australia. That played itself out in over 50 exercises since 2017 for emergency response preparation involving the National Incident Room and also led the World Health Organization to identify Australia in 2017 as one of the most prepared nations in the world. All of that saw the Australian approach of working together through the AHPPC and the containment and capacity measures lead to the outcomes that we've had in Australia.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hinkler</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Resources, Water and Northern Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:31</span>):  I thank the honourable member for that question. It's fantastic to get a question on northern Australia and our northern Australia agenda. I can confirm for the member that the NAIF has made investment decisions for some $2.4 billion of the $5 billion allocated to the NAIF. But it's not just about the NAIF. This is about our agenda for the north, delivering for the people of the north and providing jobs for the people of the north. Once again, those opposite simply don't understand business. Is the member suggesting a project proponent should draw down on a loan at a time they don't need it, pay interest rates at a time they don't need it and pay extra costs at a time they don't need it? We have committed through the NAIF $2.4 billion in investment decisions. We will continue to deliver.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In fact, in the Northern Territory just recently Humpty Doo Barramundi, the famous fighting barramundi of the Northern Territory, received another commitment from the NAIF, a second loan. That means more jobs in the Territory, more opportunities for the Territory and more opportunities for the north.</span>

The Northern Territory government's ship lift has got a $300 million loan. Verdant Minerals, for a phosphate mine, has got a $160 million loan. Northern Territory airport has got $150 million.

I was there just a few weeks ago. The construction's underway. It's getting close to completion. It will deliver a centre for the people of the north. There is no reason you can't be educated and trained in the north to the same level as other places. That's what we're delivering. We will continue to provide these facilities, jobs in the north and opportunities for the north, and we will get on with the job.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hume</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Energy and Emissions Reduction</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:34</span>):  I thank the member for Longman for his question. As a former small business owner he knows how important affordable, reliable energy is for small businesses in this country. He also knows that the key to emissions reduction, to a pathway to emissions reduction, is the development and deployment of new and emerging technologies—that means technology, not taxation. Australia's experience has been that when new technologies become economically competitive then they are rapidly adopted by Australian businesses and households. We are seeing firsthand that happen right now with the adoption of renewables in Australia 10 times the global average—four times higher than China, Japan, the US and Europe.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are now focused on unlocking new technologies that will help us to bring down emissions and address the challenges of those new technologies like firming of renewables. This is all about setting practical goals for those new technologies, like the goal of $900 per tonne for low-emissions steel.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we recover from the COVID-19 pandemic a plan to strengthen the economy, as we are bringing down our emissions, is more important than ever. But it's not clear that those opposite all agree. We saw a perfect example of that in this place earlier today when the member for Hindmarsh couldn't name a single Labor energy policy in a 20-minute speech—not a single Labor energy policy. There was no plan for gas. There was no plan for reliable, affordable energy. There was no plan for a 2030 target. There was no plan to stay in the Paris Agreement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This week we saw the AWU, the CFMEU and 32 Labor MPs with the member for Hindmarsh in their sights. They showed up at an event on Tuesday night where we saw a plan laid out for Labor. I'm not sure that the member for Hindmarsh got there, but I will lay it out for him now: a plan for gas complementing renewables, a plan for coal, a plan for technology and industry. That's a great plan. It's aligned with our plan. We've seen more constructive policy from the CFMEU and the AWU this week than we've seen from the member for Hindmarsh in seven years as shadow minister. While those opposite fight amongst themselves we're getting on with the job.</span>

                  </a>  The budget—which is a plan for the future, a blueprint, a vision for what we laid out for the future for COVID recovery—included $2 billion for water infrastructure on top of the $1½ billion that we've got for the National Water Infrastructure Development Fund. We are getting on with the job of building water infrastructure. We're working with state governments. I look forward to working with Deb Frecklington and the Liberal National Party state government in Queensland after Saturday, to build water infrastructure in North Queensland. Hells Gates, Big Rocks Weir, Rookwood Weir—let's get on with that. We've put $176.1 million on the table. What we've seen, unfortunately, is procrastination and stalling by the state Labor government in Queensland. We'll get on and we'll build it. We want willing partners—Hughenden and Macalister. We go further south. We've got Stanthorpe and Emu Swamp. I know how important that is for water security and for the irrigators at Emu Swamp. In fact, they've put millions of dollars of their own money towards that project. I know how important building dams and building pipelines is. There's Mitiamo. We go to Scottsdale in north-east Tasmania. We are getting on with the job. I can hear the member for Watson shouting out. He wanted to take water away from our irrigators.

                  </a>  When it comes to Labor, their actual water policies don't hold water! But I see the member for New England; he's very delighted that we're changing from loans to grants. There are the Dungowan Dam and Wyangala Dam. Those two projects in New South Wales are going to add to water security, help flood mitigation and provide water for agriculture—and, if there's one thing that we're going to do and we're striving to do on this side, and we've got a plan, it's to build agriculture from a $60 billion enterprise to $100 billion enterprise by 2030. Now, there's a 2030 target that is absolutely worth striving for, and we are going to do it. The National Farmers Federation are very much behind it. At Dungowan, near Tamworth, on the Peel, we're going to replace the dam that they've had since 1958. It's going to make sure the people in and around Tamworth can get on with the job of building agriculture in northern New South Wales. Dungowan Dam and Wyangala Dam—raising the Wyangala Dam wall by 10 metres—are going to add to the capacity of inland New South Wales by the equivalent of 1.2 Sydney Harbours. That's water. That's a plan. We're getting on with it; you just talk about it. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">McPherson</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Industry, Science and Technology</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:43</span>):  I thank the member for his question. Last night, we celebrated some amazing Australian scientists and their achievements, with the Prime Minister's Prizes for Science. This really is science's night of nights. We would normally be gathering in the Great Hall; representatives from across this chamber would be there, recognising and supporting the great achievements of scientists right across this country. Because of COVID, we clearly could not hold the event here at Parliament House last night, but it was held virtually, and that does give the opportunity to those members who were unable to see it live last night to go and watch it—because there are some amazing scientists and their achievements that are being showcased online. It really demonstrated to us how we have turned to the science community during this particularly difficult time, as we look for a way out of the situation in which we find ourselves with COVID-19. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The winners of this year's top prize for science were Emeritus Professor David Blair, Professor David McClelland, Professor Susan Scott and Professor Peter Veitch. Professor Veitch is actually from the member for Sturt's electorate. Their achievements have been absolutely amazing. That team has been instrumental in the world-first detection of gravitational waves. Effectively, these four humble Australians helped prove Einstein's prediction of the existence of gravitational waves about 100 years after he first predicted them. It means that we are now able, through their discovery, to look back to almost the beginning of time and explore parts of the universe in a way that we had only hoped could ever be possible.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There were also amazing achievements through our innovators and our teachers. I would actually like to make special mention of the winners of last night's teaching awards. They were Sarah Fletcher and Darren Hamley. Our science teachers do amazing work. They are inspiring the next generation of students to study science, technology, engineering and maths. Tomorrow is World Teachers Day. As the mother of a daughter who is currently doing year 12 and will finish next month, I have had the opportunity to meet some amazing teachers. As a parent, I am really grateful for the work that they have done to support my children and to support every child here in Australia. To the wider Australian science community I say: thank you for the work that you have done.</span>

During the election, the government announced the $100 million Recycling Investment Fund. The government recycled the announcement on World Environment Day in June 2019 and again in December 2019. Prime Minister, as of last week not a single dollar had been advanced. Wouldn't it be better to deliver on announcements rather than recycle empty ones?</span>

The $100 million Australian Recycling Investment Fund is administered by the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. The mandate was signed on 17 December 2019. There are transactions in the forward investment pipeline. We are advised that it continues to assess and screen expressions of interest that have been received since the fund was established and are being held as commercial-in-confidence. Understandably, there have been many inquiries.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The timing of any commercial transaction depends, as members would know, on a number of factors from both project proponents and the CEFC itself. As with all CEFC investments, projects seeking finance through the Australian Recycling Investment Fund must be commercial, must reflect the requirements that we put into the mandate and must deliver a positive return for taxpayers. So what I'm saying to the member for Fremantle is we are taking the time to get it right and to make sure that those investments bring the returns that every taxpayer would expect. They are being made, understood and studied, and we are on track to achieve them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is good to mention that $100 million because recently we've leveraged $1 billion additional investment in waste and recycling with our Recycling Modernisation Fund. So $100 million leveraged $600 million in partnerships with states and industry and generated $1 billion of investment, which is more than 10,000 jobs, particularly in regional Australia, over the next 10 years. That's genuine microeconomic reform that will transform our rural industries, our regional industries and our waste and recycling sector.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Maranoa</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Agriculture, Drought and Emergency Management and Deputy Leader of the National Party</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:50</span>):  I thank the member for Mallee for her question. She represents a very proud electorate with a rich history in not only agriculture but particularly horticulture. After many years of drought and fire, now COVID-19 has thrown up another unique challenge to agriculture, particularly for the hort sector, around workforce. Traditionally the horticulture sector has relied heavily on overseas workers. Since COVID-19 we have gone from over 140,000-odd working holiday-makers down to over 60,000. We've continued to maintain the number of seasonal Pacific workers around the 8,000 mark, but this has put significant pressure on the agricultural sector, in farmers being able to get product off the paddock onto our plates and around the world. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In March we could see that there were challenges that were going to lie ahead as we got into the warmer months and we acted pre-emptively to extend the terms of those visa holders for 12 months if they worked in agriculture. We said to those three cohorts, 'If you come and work in the bush and help farmers, you can stay for another 12 months.' In August, the Minister for International Development and the Pacific worked proactively with 10 nations to reopen the seasonal and Pacific worker programs, and today they have got 22,000 pre-vetted work-ready workers ready to come to Australia to help farmers. Those jobs can only be taken once they have been market tested here for Australians to take them up first, but they are ready to come on demand when the states provide the quarantine arrangements necessary that their chief medical officer will allow. We are ready to stamp the visas. We are ready to support this, once Australians have had first crack at it and once we can make sure that the states have signed off on the quarantine arrangements. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have also said to young Australians that it's important that you go and have a look at your own country. There's no opportunity to backpack around the world. There is an opportunity to backpack around your country and support farmers. We've accelerated the pathway to youth allowance and Abstudy for those young Australians, who can go out and earn over $15,000. They will go back to uni, ready for O week, with money in their pocket and be ready to take up youth allowance when they get back. We've said not only to them but to every Australian that we'll reimburse up to $6,000 of your travel costs to incentivise you, because these jobs are some thousands of kilometres away and are very transient. They last for three or four weeks, and then they will move on to another. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We said to the states in September, 'Please sign up to the ag workers code.' Once we have Australians moving and we have overseas workers, we need them to move between states. If we cannot do that, then farmers miss out. We have an integrated agricultural system, particularly across the eastern seaboard, and it's particularly important that the states work together to make sure that we do that in a COVID-safe way. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is our way of facing up to the many challenges agriculture has faced. But it continues to shake them off and continues to move towards that ambitious goal of $100 billion by 2030.</span>

The facts are that we've committed $250 million under our JobMaker program for the arts and entertainment sector. Of course, this builds on the over $300 million—$336 million, in fact—which has been provided to JobKeeper, to people who are working in what's called the creative and performing arts subsector of the cultural and creative sector. In fact, this year we've announced almost $800 million in additional arts and entertainment funding on top of $750 million in core funding. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me explain to the member exactly how the Temporary Interruption Fund, which is a $50 million component of the $250 million JobMaker Plan, works. What the Temporary Interruption Fund does is provide support for screen productions which, in the absence of that fund, were not able to proceed because insurers would not provide coverage against key person risk due to COVID. That meant no screen finance being released, and no TV and film productions able to proceed. That's why we committed $50 million under the Temporary Interruption Fund. That money has been deployed. It is now committed to over 20 productions, and eight of those productions are already underway—people employed, people at work in film and television production. That adds to our very substantial expenditure on the Location Incentive Program—$400 million. We are seizing the opportunity that our nation has because of our response to COVID. We are seen as a place that has good protocols in place. That's why we have had very extensive interest from international productions to come to Australia and commence filming in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed, NBCUniversal has announced a commitment to programs like <span style="font-style:italic;">Young Rock</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Irreverent</span>. <span style="font-style:italic;">Young Rock</span> features Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson, an actor whose oeuvre I'm very familiar with as I have an 11-year-old son. He is a very popular actor and it is a very popular production. Most importantly, it's going to generate 1,000 jobs and 2,000 opportunities for extras in Queensland, and there will be more opportunities around Australia. So I completely reject the proposition that the funding we have committed has not already been put to work; it has, and Australians are in jobs as a result.</span>

This is an important program and those hubs will continue to be delivered around the country. But not only that. What we'll be delivering is the $1 billion JobTrainer Fund—some 340,000 job training places. All states have now have signed on. The industry minister yesterday noted that we were still waiting for the Victorian government to sign on, and the Treasurer advised me last night that Victoria has signed up to the JobTrainer Fund. I think it's a great initiative, and we thank the Victorian government for their support. That's 340,000 places, because, as Australians are gathering together and they move towards the end of this year and they look forward to next year, the fact that we are creating almost 30,000 places in higher education and 340,000 places for job training, all of these programs working together with the states and territories—</span>

As the member notes, our industrial system in Australia is unique, and with that uniqueness comes unique benefits, but also some very particular and unique problems that have developed over time in Australia. Many of the benefits of the system are obvious. The OECD notes that Australia has the highest minimum wage in the world. And we know our system of awards sits over the minimum wage. We know that over the award system and award payments sit enterprise agreements. We know that the enterprise agreement system was designed and described by Paul Keating as trying to move people away from awards onto enterprise agreements, where there are higher wages and higher productivity. But the system is also complex and, at times, operates very, very inflexibly. That's why the government took changes to the Fair Work Act to this parliament, on an emergency basis, alongside the JobKeeper payments, to build flexibilities in. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While we're talking about delivery today, it might be worth mentioning again what I mentioned yesterday: those emergency changes to the Fair Work Act, which are some of the greatest reforms to that act in a decade or so, saved hundreds of thousands of jobs—500,000 businesses said that those changes were either important or essential to maintaining their operation during the COVID-19 pandemic. That delivery saved hundreds of thousands of jobs. It occurs to us as a government that if flexibilities could save hundreds of thousands of jobs during the COVID pandemic then reasonable, sensible flexibilities that are generated on a cooperative basis can also help grow jobs as we come out of the pandemic. And the unique problems? Well, there is no definition of 'casual employee' in the Fair Work Act, even though so much turns on the distinction between a casual or a permanent part-time employee.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The enterprise bargaining approval process has become incredibly technical and rigid and is not used anywhere near enough. One example of a very inflexible rule is around part-time employment. For instance, in the general retail award you can have a situation that arises often where an employer might want to provide more hours to a part-time employee and the employee might want to work more hours but the current award rule means that the offer is, in practical terms, never actually made, because there's no flexibility that allows an employee and an employer to agree the terms on which that would occur, outside a very narrow range. And through our many working groups we've heard from people who have said, from both the employer side and the employee side, that this plays out with regard to a number of awards: vehicles, clerks, fitness and many others. Work is not offered and work can't be done, because of the inflexibility of the system, and these are things that we need to deal with.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cook</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Prime Minister and Minister for the Public Service</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:06</span>):  I will tell you what we're borrowing money for. That's what I was asked about. I was asked about why the government is borrowing money. We borrowed money to save Australian lives and to save Australian livelihoods. When I had the opportunity to move through Queensland—something the Leader of the Opposition didn't dare to do, I note, before the Queensland election—he wasn't welcome in Queensland, not even from his own side of politics. I was very happy to be in Queensland and, as I moved through Queensland, a number of people, of businesses and small businesses, and of employees and others stopped me and said to me, 'JobKeeper and JobSeeker saved my job, saved my livelihood, saved my business.' That was the story from one end of Queensland to the other. That's why this government has invested some 13.7 in direct financial support—around 26 per cent of the size of our economy—to ensure that Australia recovers from the COVID-19 recession.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, the Labor Party doesn't even know how this recession occurred. They don't even know how we got into it. That's why they've got no clue as to how Australia can get out of it. But we understand it. That's why the budget this year laid out the COVID recovery plan for this country, building on the JobSeeker and JobKeeper support, which I admit has come at a great cost and has meant we have had to go and raise those funds in the markets. But I can tell you what: those markets provided that finance because of the solid balance sheet and the trust they have in the financial management of this government, and because we came into this crisis with a strong balance sheet as recognised by Standard &amp; Poor's. This enabled our government to help Australians in their time of greatest need, a time when they needed it more than any other. It is disappointing that the opposition cannot join the government in understanding the important steps that needed to be taken but rather come in here and seek to undermine confidence when Australians know that they can have confidence in their future because of the way our government has responded to them and supported them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yes, we have taken on a burden of debt to ensure that there is a today, a tomorrow and the future in this country for all Australians. If those opposite had been elected at the last election then we would not be seeing that. This country would have been crippled by taxes and fiscal mismanagement before the crisis even hit. There are many people around the country, I have no doubt, very pleased that, when the crisis hit, it was a Liberal-National government that was there to support Australians.</span>

She's a great champion of all things South Australian and she does a wonderful job in her electorate, so I'm very pleased to receive a question from her. At the beginning of this year, in the National Security Committee we received many, many confronting reports and predictions from all of the specialists available to us—the Chief of the Defence Force, the head of the Australian Federal Police, the head of the health department, the chief health officer et cetera—and I think the strongest decision taken by the Prime Minister at the start of this year was to close our international borders, which prevented Australia from going into what we're seeing in Europe at the moment and what we're seeing in the United States, in Asia and in the Middle East. That single act saved Australia from what we are seeing unfold right across the world at the moment. That act has resulted in us being able to deliver a budget that has helped Australians through this crisis, in the darkest hour, to make sure that through JobKeeper and JobSeeker we can provide support to those businesses that the Prime Minister just spoke of.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the same time, we have been able to support businesses, we have been able to support people in their jobs and we have been able to support our agencies that keep Australians safe day and night. Much of the work that the ASIO officers do, the Australian Federal Police officers do or those officers at the ACIC or ABF do, right through the night, over the weekend and over Christmas is never seen by Australians, but I promise you it keeps us safe in our country and it keeps our interests safe abroad. We make sure that our agencies are properly invested in. We've put more money, in this budget, into ASIO to make sure that we can deal with the threat of terrorism, which is ever-present. The threat of terrorism hasn't diminished with COVID-19. We are still facing very significant threats, and our agencies are dealing with that, including this very day, where warrants are being executed as we speak.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are dealing with the reality that we face at our borders. The Australian Border Force is led by Mike Outram. I think he's leading the best agency in the world in terms of the way in which we've been able to respond at our international borders, both here and where people are seeking to board planes or to hop onto boats to come to our country, illegally or otherwise. I can assure you that we are doing this because we have managed the budget well. The strong balance sheet that the Prime Minister spoke about before doesn't just enable us to provide JobSeeker and JobKeeper; it enables of us to spend more money in the Australian Federal Police. The Commissioner of the Australian Federal Police describes the budget this year as the best in four years. We'll continue to support Australians, because we make the right decisions in our national interests.</span>

We have committed $380 million. And I'll make the point that we did recently announce additional funding, because we're getting on with it. We have also announced $37 million for strengthening telecommunications against natural disasters, with $8 million going to temporary facilities, such as satellite COWs—cells on wheels—and satellite Road Muster trucks to be delivered by NBN. Some of those Road Muster trucks will be available before the end of this year.</span>

I'll tell you what: triple 0 has been a longstanding well-known number in Australian telecommunications—it took this side to turn it into a policy in relation to mobile coverage in the bush.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cook</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Prime Minister and Minister for the Public Service</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:19</span>):  I thank the member for Grey for his question. He knows that Australia's comeback has begun. Australia's comeback from the COVID-19 recession has begun. Our recovery has begun. That has been acknowledged, not just by the Australian people but of course by the financial credit-rating agencies, in particular Standard &amp; Poor's. The Reserve Bank of Australia have also acknowledged this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia's comeback has begun. And that is on the basis of an important comeback recovery plan that was set out by the Treasurer in this year's budget. It builds on the significant decisions and actions taken by this government to ensure that we have been able to move through what has been a very difficult year for all Australians as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic. Some of the most difficult decisions that were taken in the early part of this pandemic were about how we had to gear down the Australian economy in those early months. But our government was always committed to ensuring that, as we had to gear down the Australian economy, it would not be stuck in neutral, and that we would have to move it out of neutral and gear up again. That has been the policy of our government as we've been moving to have the Australian economy get into the next gear, to open up again, to move forward and not stay stuck with the restrictions and the other limitations on the economy going forward, particularly into 2021.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the member for Grey's electorate there are 1,200 job vacancies. We want to see Australians get into those jobs in the member for Grey's electorate. The same is true particularly in rural and regional electorates all across this country, as well as through our major cities and suburbs. The Australian economy is beginning to recover. There are jobs and we want to see Australians go into those jobs. We are transitioning the supports that we have, through our JobMaker and JobSeeker programs, to get Australians back into those jobs. I know Australians don't want to be on government support. They want to be in jobs. They want their businesses open. They want to look forward to the future with confidence. Our budget provides that plan. The investments that we've made have provided that support so Australians can go into the next phase.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">As Australians gather around this Christmas, and they come around as families, I want them to look forward to a 2021 with great confidence, knowing that under this government's policies they will be able to do just that. They will be able to go to university and training places that are available, to businesses that are open and to jobs that have been made available, because businesses are open and investing and looking forward again. The year 2021 is going to be far stronger than 2020. The reason for that is the great perseverance and commitment of Australians. It's also because of the great support that they're getting from this government. On that note, I ask that further questions be placed on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Notice Paper</span>.</span>

He was at a bus stop on Nambour Connection Road wanting to go shopping for Christmas when he was abducted and murdered. His name was Daniel Morcombe. It's in Daniel's memory that many of us in this House today wear a red ribbon or a badge. Red is to signify the colour of the shirt that Daniel was wearing on that horrific day. It is red too that we will wear on Friday of this week when, together with Australians right across the nation, we will walk in solidarity with the Morcombe family to kickstart this year's Day for Daniel to raise awareness of child safety.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">By starting the Daniel Morcombe Foundation his parents, Bruce and Denise, have turned a tragedy into a message of hope. They've worked tirelessly respecting the sanctity of life of children and helping to keep them safe from harm and abuse. On behalf of this House I say to Bruce and to Denise: we walk with you, we stand with you and we thank you.</span>

I've gone through <span style="font-style:italic;">Practice</span>, and I'm not sure there's a precedent for it, so I'm not sure whether the House needs to take action or not.

The speech he gave was about order of the day No. 4, the Social Services and Other Legislation Amendment (Omnibus) Bill. I'm not sure whether this has an impact on the potential interpretation of the act or whether there's anything the House can do to rectify this, but certainly, going through <span style="font-style:italic;">Practice</span>, it appears to be unprecedented.

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Time">15:27</span>):  I thank the Manager of Opposition Business for raising it and for raising it in the detail that he has so that not just I can consider it but all members of the House have an appreciation. Clearly, as you'd expect, I'll need to consider what's said, examine the material and get back to the House at a suitable point in time. Given it's 28 past three now, it won't be today quite evidently. I'll discuss it with him and other relevant people over the course of the coming days.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">
                <a href="R36" type="MemberSpeech">
                  <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ALBANESE</span>
                </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grayndler</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Opposition</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:32</span>):  We have seen during this fortnight, both in this chamber and, most importantly, in Senate estimates, exactly where this government's priorities lie. They lie in the 24-hour media cycle and they lie in politics. They don't lie in the national interest. What we've seen is the contrast between what this government announces and what it actually delivers. What we've seen is how much waste this government is responsible for, how it prioritises looking after its mates rather than looking after the national interest and how, arising from this pandemic, there's no legacy. There's no attempt to look at what's been identified during this crisis—the weaknesses in our national economy, the weaknesses in terms of our resilience and being able to manufacture things ourselves, and how we can emerge from this crisis stronger than we went into it.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact is that this government will have nothing to show from this except for a $1 trillion debt, rising to $1.7 trillion over the next decade. How they managed to have $98 billion of new spending in the budget without any issues of substance in terms of economic reform is, quite frankly, beyond me. But for this government it's all about marketing and spin. The announcement is the endgame in itself. It's about a Prime Minister and ministers who treat taxpayers' money as if it were Liberal Party money or National Party money. This is a government with no vision, just division; big on the photo-op, never there for the follow-up. It's a government that still hasn't delivered a plan for aged care.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Today in question time I asked about PPE, a fundamental issue. More than half of the requests from aged-care facilities for PPE have been rejected by this government. We asked about the Emergency Response Fund, where they set up a $4 billion fund, with $200 million each year, and yet not a single dollar of the first year's $200 million has been spent. Anyone would think there were no issues with bushfire recovery or with resilience in the lead-up to the next season. We asked as well about a whole range of the rorts which are there. This government comes to the dispatch box and speaks about manufacturing. But do you know what? We now know that it spent more on sports rorts than it has allocated for manufacturing in the next year. That is its priority.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">And, of course, the government forgot about women in the budget. They just forgot. They forgot that in order to grow the economy and to grow back stronger you need to concentrate on the three Ps of economic growth. We put forward a plan for childcare reform, through the shadow minister, that will deal with the three Ps of economic growth that you need. This will really boost productivity, it will boost workforce participation of women and it will also assist with population by providing economic security for people to make decisions going forward. It's a plan that is about serious economic reform—lifting the cap, increasing the subsidy to 90 per cent and smoothing out the taper rate so that the disincentive that's there in the system for women to work a fourth or fifth day is removed. Those opposite just say no. They say that women can ride on roads. There's precedent for that and their obsession over women's issues with regard to driving on roads and what they can do, because when we asked during the Eden-Monaro by-election about maternity facilities at Yass hospital the Prime Minister responded he was putting in an extra lane on the Barton Highway—the world's first birthing lane there on the Barton Highway!</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">When we raised women's issues after the budget, one of the things that they spoke about was the Boosting Female Founders Initiative—$18 million. You might recall, the day after the budget, the Prime Minister talking about that. It was $18 million announced on 20 November 2018. It was reannounced on 21 November and reannounced on 17 March 2020. But guess what? They haven't spent a single dollar, not one of the $18 million. You know what they did in the budget? They announced a second round. They haven't allocated a dollar in the first round, but they have announced a second round. Who says they get ahead of themselves?</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">What we have seen is revelation after revelation of rorted programs and dodgy dealings—sports rorts; the Great Barrier Reef Foundation; the Badgerys Creek land deal; $1.1 million for Crosby Textor, the Liberal Party pollsters, to do marketing on the recovery; and $15 million of taxpayers' money on those ads and billboards around the country that provide no information for people, none whatsoever. It's just straight party-political marketing. Then when the issue came out about the $20,000—not $12,000—Cartier watches that were given to four executives, the Prime Minister showed the greatest faux outrage that we have seen from him. There was no outrage about the $30 million for Badgerys Creek, no outrage about the sports rorts saga done in his office with colour coded sheets, and no outrage about the other regional rorts funds that have been allocated by this government, but we saw outrage and immediate action on this. She had to stand aside. Do you remember that? That's because they knew that the next day the ASIC abuse of taxpayers' funds was coming as well. Think about this: why would bureaucrats think that taxpayers' money wasn't subject to the same abuse by them that they see ministers and this Prime Minister engaging in? They have set the precedent for this with the funnelling of money to Crosby Textor. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister said, 'If you are good at your job you will get a job.' So how come Angus Taylor still has his? We just had a question from the Manager of Opposition Business about the minister giving a second reading summing-up speech on the wrong bill. Maybe he downloaded it off some website somewhere! We still don't know where that document about the Sydney City Council came from. We do know that it was fraudulent. We do know that.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact is that there's a contagion of corruption that has gone from this government to the Public Service, a contagion of the attitude which is: public money, taxpayers' money, is fair game. You can abuse it. You can use it for partisan political purposes. The person who sits in the chair of Prime Minister is less Prime Minister and more first mate. That's what we know. He's turned the Administrative Appeals Tribunal into 'mate keeper': 70 different appointments of former Liberal and National Party MPs, state and federal, across the board. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">We also see the announcements that don't result in anything: NAIF, a three per cent spend; the National Water Infrastructure Loan Facility, 50 media releases since 2016, then abolished without a dollar going forward; arts, $250 million, with not a dollar going forward; the Recycling Investment Fund—the announcement's recycled, but not a single dollar is flowing; and the Regional Connectivity Program, announced in March 2019 and added to in the last budget, with another $30 million, lifting it up to $82 million, but they still haven't spent a dollar there. Everything with this PM is an IOU, an IOU to the Australian people that is never paid back. If announcements were a form of renewable energy, we would be a renewable energy superpower today under this government. It is a government, and Prime Minister, defined by its arrogance and its hubris and by looking after itself and its mates first and the public second.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Arising out of this crisis, Australia deserves better. Australian Labor will give it better. That's why we put forward a plan for childcare reform. That's why we put forward a plan for a future made in Australia, looking after jobs as our first priority, making sure that the Australian national interest is looked after. Those opposite just engage in short-term politics and looking after their mates day after day, which is why they'll be rejected at the next election. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr MORTON</span>
                </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tangney</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister to the Prime Minister and Cabinet</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:42</span>):  We do know that the Leader of the Opposition really does enjoy this chamber. In fact, if I ever want advice on parliamentary practice, he will be the first person, perhaps the second person, that I will go and speak to. But I will take no advice from the Leader of the Opposition in relation to what's in the best interests of the Australian people, because he has no idea. The Leader of the Opposition's bark is worse than his bite. He loves this chamber. He roars like a lion in this chamber, but the reality is he's more like a little kitty cat. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is focused on the interests of Australia and Australians, focused on protecting lives from the global coronavirus pandemic, focused on protecting livelihoods. Nowhere has this been more clearly seen than in our focus on helping Australians keep their jobs. The government's cornerstone JobKeeper and JobSeeker programs have sustained Australia's workforce and those Australians who have lost their jobs. We have seen the economy fighting back from the economic effects of COVID-19, with 446,000 jobs coming back over the last four months. That's in the interests of Australians. Of the 1.3 million people who lost their job or were stood down, around 60 per cent are back at work. We're going to get Australia out of recession. We're going to support the creation of jobs in the private sector, because it employs eight out of 10 Australians. Our economic relief plan will create jobs, build our economy and secure Australia's future. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">There's a monumental task ahead, but Australia's up to the task. This week we embark, as a nation, on our next stage of the journey. Our plan will grow the economy, create jobs and guarantee the essential services that Australians rely on. It will support nearly half a million young Australians through the JobMaker hiring credit. The $4 billion scheme will support around 450,000 positions by giving employers incentives, from 7 October, to create new jobs. They will get support for every new job they create in the next 12 months that employs someone who's been on JobSeeker, youth allowance or the parenting payment. We will invest a record amount in skills and training. We will support our manufacturing industry. We'll incentivise businesses to invest in their business, creating more economic activity and jobs. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">We are providing tax relief for more than 11 million hardworking Australians, putting more money in their pocket to spend in small businesses across the country and help create jobs. Since the onset of COVID-19, the government has provided $257 billion in direct economic support to cushion the blow and strengthen the recovery. The 2020-21 budget commits a further $98 billion, including $25 billion in direct COVID-19 response measures and $74 billion in new measures to create jobs. The government's economic support since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic has been unprecedented and will continue to support households and businesses through the recovery.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">If our budget isn't focused on the interests of Australia and Australians then why did the opposition support it? The opposition voted for our fast-tracked tax cuts, while our JobMaker package went through here on the voices. If the government isn't focused on the interests of Australia, the federal budget being the principal instrument of government policy, why did the opposition support the budget? When we talk about being focused on the interests of Australians, we have been focused absolutely on what is important to them: their health and their jobs. But those opposite, when meetings of the National Security Committee were occurring to deal with the economic and health impacts of coronavirus, were in here playing their parlour games, calling a range of divisions to distract the Prime Minister, the health minister and the Attorney-General from their work.</span>

                </a>  The member for Shortland doesn't want to hear how the government is delivering for the people of Shortland. He is absolutely choosing to be deaf on these very important deliverables for the people of his community. I have never met a member of parliament more disconnected than he is from the aspirations and concerns of the people he claims to represent. Four thousand five hundred businesses in Shortland have been supported through the government's JobKeeper payments to help keep employees connected to businesses. Around 7,647 individuals in Shortland have received the coronavirus supplement, which was added to JobSeeker to provide additional support through the crisis. And age pensioners in Shortland, who the former member for Shortland, Jill Hall, was very concerned about—the current member, perhaps less so—have benefited. Around 22,778 pensioners in Shortland received support payments of $750 in April and July and will receive a $250 payment in December and a further $250 payment in March next year. And 2,179 carers in Shortland received support payments as well.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Normal">While the opposition have been playing their parliamentary games, this government is focused on delivering on what is important for Australians. The Deputy Prime Minister, Michael McCormack, has worked tirelessly to ensure our aviation sector can be supported through its most difficult period. They have worked to facilitate freight flights, which are really important, from regional Australia, from Queensland and WA to Hong Kong and Singapore to ensure our export produce can still meet the market. Our Attorney-General has been working with trade unions and business representative towards historic changes to the Fair Work Act and working to make sure Safe Work Australia can provide guidance to businesses when they need it in dealing with the pandemic. There is work that the Treasurer has been doing across all of the government in relation to our economic response, whether it be HomeBuilder or the $800 million Digital Business Plan to drive Australia's economic recovery. There is the amazing work that Minister Hunt has done as health minister, making sure that we were able to secure the use of 30,000 hospital beds from the private sector. Australia was facing a health disaster caused by a pandemic, and this government, when we asked ourselves, acted in the interests of Australians. The health minister, working closely with the Prime Minister, secured 30,000 additional private hospital beds should they be needed in the fight against COVID-19. I am so thankful that they weren't needed, but this government was focused on making sure that we had the health supports in place for the worst. We prepared for the worst, and we hoped for the best. </span>

The work that Minister Robert has done, working closely with the hardworking public servants of Services Australia, has supported Australians in their time of need. Minister Andrews has worked with industry to ensure that they can deliver the increases that we need to deliver PPE manufacturing capability in this country. And Minister Tehan has worked to ensure that we can guarantee funding for universities, even if there's a fall in domestic student numbers, and has provided regulatory fee relief—around $100 million for the higher education and VET sectors. And that's not to mention the free child care for a million families during the pandemic, providing certainty for families in this sector. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Griffith</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:52</span>):  That was a bizarre contribution from the assistant minister, who seemed to spend more time talking about the member for Shortland than defending his own government's record. But how can he defend his own government's record? They have no record to defend. The Prime Minister spent a week campaigning for the LNP in the Queensland state election, including attending an LNP fundraiser with the Deputy Prime Minister and the Queensland opposition leader, but at the same time he claims he hasn't had time to establish a national integrity commission. The Prime Minister has got time to help his LNP and other mates in Queensland, but he doesn't have time to establish a national integrity commission. He has time to rack up a trillion dollars of debt but no time to make sure his government leaves no one behind. He's had time to send out 50 press releases in the four years since he personally announced, when he was the Treasurer, the establishment of the National Water Infrastructure Loans Facility, a facility that was abolished a couple of weeks ago without having written a single loan. They wrote 50 press releases; they wrote zero loans. This is a government that produces nothing for Australia but media releases, photo-ops and announcements. </span>

              <span class="HPS-Normal">This government's message to Australians is: what's yours is ours. The Prime Minister's golden rule is: we look after our mates. This is the sort of Prime Minister that we're dealing with. Can I tell the House that in Queensland the Prime Minister has some frankly terrible mates. I would like to start with the LNP leader in Queensland, Deb Frecklington. She's one of the worst mates to have, and she is someone that the Prime Minister spent a lot of time with recently. By the way, the Queensland LNP have been resisting telling Queenslanders how they will pay for their promises until today, two days before the state election—they didn't want anyone to know how they were going to do that particular pea-and-thimble trick. Deb Frecklington was Campbell Newman's assistant minister when the LNP was last in government. This is a government—the Campbell Newman government, the LNP government—that sacked tens of thousands of Queensland workers. I'm talking of course—</span>

                </a>  As you know, Deputy Speaker, I'm talking here about the Prime Minister having the wrong priorities for the people of Australia. This is a Prime Minister who spent time in the Queensland state election campaigning, and you will be shocked to hear about the fact that this LNP leader that I'm talking about, who was, as I said, Campbell Newman's assistant minister when he was the Premier of Queensland, was a direct party to all of those sackings. Tens of thousands of people lost their jobs—my mother included, for that matter—when Mr Newman was Premier of Queensland. It was a very short tenure indeed, but, of course, a lot of damage was wreaked. Remember, he picked fights with the judges, with the teachers, with the doctors—imagine picking fights with the doctors, with the nurses, the education people. This is the sort of mob this Prime Minister is friends with in Queensland. This is not to mention broadscale land clearing—such massive damage across Queensland.</span>

                </a>  One of the reasons, of course, that the person the member opposite was referring to is so unpopular is that the leader of the LNP in Queensland called for Queensland's borders to be reopened 64 times. These borders have kept Queenslanders safe, and what she said is an absolute disgrace.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Normal">But another mate of the Prime Minister's is Mr Clive Palmer, a former member of this House. The Prime Minister—speaking of priorities—has had time to subsidise his mate Clive's private jet but no time to establish a national integrity commission. This is the same Clive Palmer, by the way, who is mounting a disinformation campaign of blatant outright lies to try to hack the Queensland election, the same Clive who spent $84 million in the federal election and said he deliberately decided to polarise the electorate by running attacks on Labor in the campaign's final weeks. It's an absolute disgrace, and the LNP should be ashamed. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

So, when the Prime Minister and the folks on this side of the House are working to get Australia through the worst pandemic we have seen in 100 years, the Leader of the Opposition is spending $10,000 just to get Facebook likes.

                </a>  The article, I agree, is very concerning because it goes on to say that sources in Labor's shadow ministry say that they are frustrated about not being included in announcements that concern their portfolios. They are terribly divided over there, which is why they've got these fringe groups having a knees-up at the Otis restaurant in Canberra which the member for Hunter is organising. I bet the member for Hunter doesn't tell the folks at Cessnock Leagues Club that he goes and has a knees-up at the Otis restaurant in Canberra with his fancy wines. I bet he doesn't tell them that. They are hopelessly divided over there, and it's very concerning.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Normal">Don't come in and lecture us about who's looking after the interests of Australians and their everyday concerns, because the reality is this budget was the budget that saved Australia. The Prime Minister was right today. He was right. You just have to go and walk down any street; it doesn't matter where you are. In your electorates—the members behind me all know—you walk into a cafe, you walk into a restaurant, you walk into a shop and they all say: 'You guys have done well. You've saved my business. You've saved my staff.'</span>

              <span class="HPS-Normal">I was in a cafe recently in Orange. The cafe owner said to me: 'We're like family here. To me my staff are like family. We've only been able to keep together because of the government.' She was talking about JobKeeper. That's what this government has done. When Australia was crying out for help on this side of the House we answered the call. We got those programs in, which saved businesses, which kept businesses together, which kept families together, which kept food on the tables of ordinary and everyday Australians. Yet what are those on that side of the House worried about? Division and spending big money on Facebook likes.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">There were some very exciting developments in this budget, for the regions in particular—$2 billion for the national water infrastructure development to continue the great work of securing the national water supply in the national water grid, $2 billion on road safety. The one I really like—they were the first elements emerging in our revitalised decentralisation agenda. That's what we like: getting people out of the cities into the bush, building our regions, building capacity and resilience in country Australia. They're calling those folks 'VESPAs'—the Virus Escapees Seeking Provincial Australia. They don't call them tree changers anymore. We want the VESPAs. There was that poem on the Statue of Liberty: 'Give us your huddled masses yearning to be free.' We'll take them in regional Australia. We want the VESPAs, the sea changers and the tree changers. Ordinary Australians know this government has their backs.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr DICK</span>
                </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Oxley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:02</span>):  Dodgy land deals, sports rorts back again, luxury jets for Clive, Australia Post largesse on steroids, Cartier watches, mates' rates for the Liberal Party, government not delivering an ICAC—and it is just Thursday! We know that there are some big numbers from this budget. A $213 billion deficit this financial year and $480 billion of cumulative debts over the forward estimates. The budget will be in deficit every year for the next decade. So much for being back in black. Budgets are about much more than just raw numbers. They're about priorities, a vision for Australia and, most importantly, a future for all Australians. That's where this budget falls over.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that the budget will rack up $1 trillion worth of debt but fails to create jobs in the country that needs it. It ignores the urgent need to plan and leaves too many Australians behind. Contrast that to the Leader of the Opposition, Anthony Albanese, who's delivered a plan for child care, a plan for aged care—with extra home-care places in this year's budget that should have been delivered—and a plan for energy. He wants to look after JobKeeper recipients to make sure that the million Australians are brought forward, not left behind. For all of its job 'something fixed' announcements, the government expects another 160,000 Australians to be added to the jobless queues by Christmas. That is a government that is not focused on the interests of Australians.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">This week we uncover that Australia Post—a national icon—is delivering $20,000 worth of luxury watches, a Liberal-stacked board and LNP election posters in shop windows in the post offices in my home state in the electorate of Moncrieff. The government has an Australia Post board that is a Liberal swamp of failed Liberal politicians and Liberal-connected people. We started off this year with cuts to Australia Post, with mail not being delivered and deliveries only once every few days. As pensioners in my electorate tell me, 'You pay more, but it takes longer to arrive in the mailbox.' You're absolutely disgraceful—through you, Mr Deputy Speaker, to the minister—for not holding the Australia Post board to account. </span>

            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">In my home state of Queensland—and I refer to the member for Griffith's comments—when it comes to the LNP at a state level, they're just as bad. We know that today the state LNP released their costings for the next election—the big, bold policy plans of the New Bradfield Scheme and the duplication of the Pacific Highway!</span>

                </a>  The member for Petrie says, 'Hear, hear!' Do you know how much money was committed in the costings? Zero! Zero dollars—because, as the leader said, in the next 10 to 15 years, it won't be funded. What on earth is going on with the LNP in Queensland?

            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">
                <a href="218019" type="MemberSpeech">
                  <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HOGAN</span>
                </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Page</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister to the Deputy Prime Minister</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:07</span>):  This place gets pretty weird sometimes. It certainly has today. As I think the speaker before me said, this MPI, 'the government not being focused on the interests of Australians'—I don't know who wrote that, but let's talk about it. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Deputy Speaker O'Brien, you sit through the MPI every day. I'm sure you would hope that the opposition—a constructive opposition—would come in today and say, 'Okay, we're going through a pandemic, we're going through an issue that is causing economic stress on our economy,' and they'd come up with something like, 'You might be doing this okay, but we think you as a government should be doing this as well, or direct a bit of the resources from there to there; we think that would be a better idea.' Have you heard anything like that today, Deputy Speaker? I know you haven't, because I've been listening to them all, and there hasn't been one constructive idea articulated by the other side in this whole MPI today. There are two more to go. Hopefully one of them will actually come up with an idea. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">We had the opposition leader crack what I think he thought were a few funny one-liners, and they all laughed on cue. But there were no actual ideas. We had the member for Griffith, who went through something about Campbell Newman, and the previous LNP government in Queensland and took some cheap shots at them—obviously because there's a Queensland election this weekend. As for the member for Oxley, I actually couldn't work out what he was saying. He seemed to be all over the shop. I think he even thought the Pacific Highway was in Queensland at one stage. But I'll leave that aside. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to go through some things that we should be talking about, and I'll bring them up today—the great challenges we have and how the government is focused on the interests of Australians. First, I want to go through some statistics that I think are very interesting about how Australia is performing relative to the rest of the world, not only in pandemic statistics but also economically, and what we as a government are doing to make sure that Australia does as well as it can through what are very challenging times, Deputy Speaker, as you well know. Johns Hopkins University has been tracking deaths per hundred thousand of population throughout the entire globe. I'm going to give you some comparisons. The deaths per 100,000 of the population in Australia is 3.63—all tragic. The USA is at 69.2. The UK is at 68.36 per hundred thousand. Canada is a lot lower, but still much higher than Australia, at 27.12. Has there been anyone from the other side saying, 'Look, I think we've done reasonably well and the government has done reasonably well on the pandemic front'? No. There's just cheap shots.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing that was weird this week was when the opposition leader moved a suspension of standing orders before question time and wanted to talk about Daniel Andrews's performance in Victoria. Well, blow me down! They've been the one problem—the Victorian government—with the way they did quarantine and the way they messed that up. They're actually the one thing, statistically, that has made us worse off than we otherwise would have been.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's also look at the economy. Obviously this pandemic has caused great challenges for Australia but also across the globe. We've heard that Australia's economy—as tragic as it has been—contracted by seven per cent in the June quarter. That is not good for anybody. It has been a great challenge for the men and women of Australia, for the businesses of Australia and for the wage-earners of Australia. But let's look at a comparison. I have a great friend over in New Zealand, a country lauded by a lot of people on the Left. New Zealand's economy has contracted by 12.2 per cent. Canada's has contracted by 11 per cent, France's by 13 per cent and the United Kingdom's by nearly 20 per cent.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">On the pandemic and the management of this health risk, Australia has done very well. Economically, while we've been doing it tough, we have certainly done better than most comparable countries overseas. We know that the Treasurer has spoken more recently about consumer confidence being up, especially since the budget has come out.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">What did we do with the budget? The budget this year was a really important budget, because we know about the health crisis and the economic crisis and what they're doing to people's jobs and livelihoods. Because we have so many people on our side of politics who have worked in private enterprise and have, very importantly, employed people—like my good friend the member for Petrie here, who has employed people in his pest business—we know that eight out of 10 jobs are in the private sector. What was the budget targeted on? The budget was targeted upon doing everything we can do to help those people who employ others and those people who are in the private sector, because they are the people who create the wealth and will grow us out of this crisis.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HUSIC</span>
                </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Chifley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:12</span>):  Sometimes, with the greatest respect, the most powerful voices in this place don't come from the Prime Minister or the Leader of the Opposition or ministers or shadow ministers. The most compelling words come from the people we humbly represent. Yesterday I received from a bloke in my electorate an email that upset me quite a bit. I had spoken up for him previously, and, like many Australians, the company he works for has been doing it tough over the last few months. He sent me an update on how he's going. I want to give this House an insight into his life right now, because the MPI rightly says we need to focus on the interests of Australians—we should focus on people like him.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the last few months, he and his workmates had to go into standdown and couldn't work. I won't read the entirety of the email, but I do want to give you an insight into what he has gone through. He said: 'I've been continuing to work for around eight hours a week over two days. When I inquired how much support I could get with that low amount of work, I was entitled to a massive $12 a fortnight. Finding casual work to fit in with the time I was working was extremely difficult. To support myself and my family, I have been using what's left of my annual leave and my long service leave. I've been using what I was able to withdraw from my super, which is dwindling fast. Since I last wrote to you I've been on standdown. After the first three months of standdown it was extended to a further three months and it's continuing on. We're expected to take special leave without pay or come to some agreement of a temporary position of approximately 20 to 24 hours, but the company has since admitted they can't even promise that much to employees.'</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">This bloke has applied for 50 jobs. He doesn't care what he does. He'll stock shelves or drive trucks or delivery vehicles. He's been for a few interviews but to date has been unsuccessful. He said—and this is what got me: 'I feel my life and work experience and the skills I could bring to a new employer get ignored when they see my age. I'm now 40 and I'm soon to be 41.' He said to me, 'What I would really like to know—if at some stage you could ask him—is what Mr Morrison expects people in my position to do, when we try to do the right thing: paying taxes, being decent citizens, trying to gain meaningful employment. How are we supposed to achieve this when he and his government keep changing the rules and moving the goalposts? I feel like I've been kicked in the guts by Mr Morrison.'</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">Do you know who he works for? Dnata. That is the firm that was expecting JobKeeper and was denied it. Australian workers, working on Australian soil and paying Australian taxes, were denied support at the moment they needed it. By the way, like many of us, I lobbied the government to put these people back onto JobKeeper and was told: 'Nuh, it can't happen.' It could have been changed at the last minute, but we couldn't change their minds. I think of this bloke, Adam from Lethbridge Park, and I wonder what he thinks when he sees the government spend $100 billion extra in the budget. They're going towards a trillion in debt. A bloke like this in the suburbs can't get support—and you've heard what he's going through, Mr Deputy Speaker—but Clive Palmer gets support out of the government to run his private planes.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">There's no plan for the aviation sector. There are people wondering when the international borders will open and they can get work again. They can't find other work, and they see all this stuff happening around them. They see Cartier watches in Australia Post. And the people in Australia Post who are worried about their jobs or their take-home pay see the government pay donors for land at 10 times its worth in the deal at Badgerys Creek. They see all the money wasted on sports rorts, with more money spent on sports rorts than on actual manufacturing in this country, and a corporate watchdog who spends hundreds of thousands of dollars for their own tax advice. This is really bad for ordinary Australians. It's shameful that the government couldn't look ordinary people like Adam of Lethbridge Park in the eye when they really wanted their government to be there for them. The government refused, but they are there for all the big people, who can already look after themselves, with some of these rorts that have been going on. It is absolutely shameful. Those on the other side of the House should absolutely hang their heads in shame.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                <a href="80072" type="MemberSpeech">
                  <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms HAMMOND</span>
                </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Curtin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:17</span>):  With reference to the speeches of a number of members on the other side of the chamber, I would note that I'm personally on record as being in favour of a strong anticorruption commission. Like many within the community, I've been shocked by some of the revelations that have come out of Senate inquiries. They have caused me grave concern. I would also say with a great deal of regret that such revelations are not new. I think ever since Senate estimates were invented we have come across, time and time again, revelations of behaviour that should not be followed. I also agree with the previous speaker that airlines and, I would add, travel agents are two sectors that we do need to look at. This government is looking at both of them, and a number of members have been making representations on their behalf.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">If I come back to the main question of the MPI, focusing on the interests of Australians, I can tell you what the people of my community have come to me about over the past six months. They have come to me with concerns about their health, they have come to me with concerns about their economic security and they have come to me with concerns about the financial, sovereign and physical security of our country. They are the three main areas that people frequently have been coming to me about. On each of those fronts this government has listened, acted proactively and—and this is the thing that pleases me most—responded. When issues have arisen that were not necessarily predicted or contemplated, this government has responded. Our Treasurer, our Prime Minister and, in fact, all of our ministers have responded when issues have arisen with perhaps a program that had to be put in place within two weeks and wasn't working as well as it should. Our ministers and our government have responded.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">So what have we done on the health front? We have done an enormous amount on the health front. The two things which have been of particular interest to the members of my community have been the increase in mental health services and the telehealth services. Right back at the beginning of the pandemic I had numerous GPs contacting me, wanting to have telehealth in place. Let's go back to prior to COVID: telehealth was not widespread at all. It was a very, very small undertaking. Since that time, since March, we have had in excess of 35.4 million telehealth services delivered to 11.26 million patients. That doesn't just happen overnight. That happened because of people asserting and arguing that we needed to put this in place and the government responding and putting in place telehealth services. There was a lot of background that had to be put in place for that. The systems had to be put in place to be able to support it. On the health front, we've been investing in treatments, in vaccine research and in building up our health systems to make sure that if we have a great rush of people who require health services we will be capable of actually delivering that and supporting people.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">On economic security, 7,300 businesses in Curtin have received JobKeeper, 6,500 businesses in Curtin received the cashflow bonus, thousands have used the instant asset write-off, close to 5,000 people in Curtin have received the JobSeeker supplement and close to 10,000 age pensioners in Curtin received the two supplementary payments of $750 in April and July. These were what were requested by my constituents. Constituents wanted economic security. The businesses in my community have all expressed enormous support for and overwhelming endorsement of the 2020-21 budget initiatives to help keep their businesses going and to ensure that they can continue to employ people.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">This is what this government is about. It's about making sure that people are safe and that our health is our priority but also that our livelihoods are maintained, that people can get an education, that people can get training and that people have jobs to look forward to so that they can live their best lives, notwithstanding the huge impact that COVID has had on our health and on our economy.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Normal">
                <a href="249224" type="MemberSpeech">
                  <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms RYAN</span>
                </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lalor</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Opposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:22</span>):  [by video link] I'm pleased to join colleagues on the matter of public importance today. There are 151 members of the House of Representatives, and we represent every corner of this country. As the member for Lalor, I represent a community under extraordinary pressure, just like every other member in the House of Representatives. In Lalor, we have gone from having 5,500 people on JobSeeker, or Newstart, in December 2019 to having almost 15,000 people on JobSeeker in August 2020. We have 6,637 businesses in receipt of JobKeeper. The estimated number of workers affected is 25,000.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">This government is failing all of those people under extraordinary financial pressure. Like the member for Chifley, the people I represent are very concerned that we are finding now, after having had an enormous conversation early in the piece about casual teenagers being in receipt of too much money, that JobKeeper is funding executive bonuses and that companies are recording record profits while in receipt of JobKeeper under this government's watch. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">People in my community are concerned, as they are in the communities of the member for Chifley and others who have spoken today. Dnata workers live in my community, as they do in the community of the member for Chifley, and they are very concerned to learn that while they can't get JobKeeper support, because of a decision of this government, Clive Palmer has been supported to the tune of $40,000 for his private jet. They are concerned about that. This government needs to take stock and take stock quickly. It continually takes a good idea like a wage subsidy and perverts it and then fails to see the perversion of it. It fails to see the impact it is actually having in the community. Similarly, as we've heard today, we have announcement after announcement, most recently the JobMaker announcement. We were promised that over 400,000 jobs would come from JobMaker, but we found out, through Senate estimates, from Treasury that the reality is 10 per cent of that—40,000 is the actual, real assessment.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">It pains general people in the Australian community when they read these things. It pains them to hear that, after sports rorts, after community grants having been used for political ends, the ANAO is having its funding cut. It pains people to think that the Audit Office, which will expose a misuse of taxpayers' funds, has actually had its ability to hold the government to account—to shine a light and to determine transparency—cut because of a budget cut. This worries Australians, and this government needs to really think about the way it's making its decisions. This government needs to act on a national integrity commission, but it says it doesn't have time. We heard the Prime Minister in question time hiding behind the pandemic, hiding behind the recession, saying that there's not enough time to get national integrity commission legislation into the parliament, although we know that the draft has been there since December.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">To government members and those who have spoken today: instead of coming in to a matter of public importance debate and waving your arms around defending the government's actions, when it is clear that errors have been made, I urge you to consider these things. Consider the people in my electorate of Lalor and those Australians who are really doing it tough. They know this isn't over, even though the government would like it to be and continues to talk about it in the past tense. They know they've got tough months ahead of them. They want to know that they've got a government that has their interests at the centre of its daily work. This government needs to get serious about doing things for ordinary Australians in this incredibly difficult time and seeing us through this recession.</span>

                </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moncrieff</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:27</span>):  I rise today a little bit concerned for the member for Grayndler. It is a difficult time to be the Leader of the Opposition, I must admit, leading such a divided party. I doubt that he's focused on the interests or the needs of Australians, because he's too busy looking over his shoulder. To know what's in the best interests of Australians you have to ask them and you have to listen to them.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">The good people of Moncrieff tell me that their best interests are served by having a job, more of their own money in their pockets and tax cuts. There is $200 million worth of tax cuts coming into Moncrieff alone in this budget. If you multiply that by three electorates on the Gold Coast, you have $600 million extra going into the economy through tax cuts alone. Perhaps the Leader of the Opposition should spend less time listening to the member for Melbourne and to the member for Hindmarsh, who is enthusiastically green but has no plan. Perhaps he should spend more time listening to sensible voices like that of the member for Hunter, who can see a future for coal, gas and jobs and for coal exports, so that other countries can raise their living standards too. The CFMMEU and AWU want their members to have a job. At least a third of the Labor caucus support coal and gas, presumably because they know it translates to jobs.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Grayndler must have no clue how we think on the Gold Coast. It's not surprising, because on the Gold Coast there is only one Labor member out of 16 and, on Saturday, when Kirsten Jackson wins the seat of Gaven back, there'll be 16 out of 16.</span>

                </a>  This debate could do with a little bit more bipartisanship.

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Jagajaga</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:30</span>):  [via video link] Today I acknowledge the resilience and strength of the people in my electorate of Jagajaga and the joy and relief we feel as stage 4 restrictions on our city ease this week. This has been such a difficult time, but we have got through it together. Today I want to focus on saying thank you to our community, because it is their efforts that have pulled us through.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To our local businesses: I know that this has been the toughest of tough times for you. I'm so pleased to see our retail and hospitality businesses opening their doors again. Thank you for wherever possible adapting and changing your business models during stage 4 restrictions. As we all bunkered down in our five-kilometre radius, you have been a big part of what has kept our community strong. I recognise there is still a long way to go for our businesses, and I assure you I will continue to fight for the support you need. For some, like our local travel agents, normal is still a very long way off. I recognise you need tailored, extra support, and I very much hope the Morrison government recognises that need as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To our healthcare workers, aged-care workers and disability care workers: you have been on the front line in every sense of the word. You've kept us safe and you have done this at a personal cost to you and your families and loved ones. To those at the Austin Hospital, the Repat, the ONJ Centre, the Mercy and the Warringal Private: thank you. To our community health services, Banyule Community Health and healthAbility: I know how much you've done to keep people safe, reaching out to some of our most vulnerable community members. To Himilo Community Connect, who've worked closely with Banyule Community Health to support our Somali community through this period: I know your work continues. Thank you.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To our schools, our kindergartens and our child-care centres: thank you. To all the students, teachers and parents, who made homeschooling possible: it's been so tough, but your ability to adapt has been inspiring. I want to particularly recognise all the VCE students, the class of 2020, doing their exams now, after this most stressful year of their schooling in these most stressful of times: you should feel so proud of everything you are achieving. While I've been pleased to remain in contact with our schools online during this period, I can't wait to be able to visit you in person again and to hear the success stories that I know will come after this year of adversity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To our charities, our support agencies and our RSLs: I know you've all found ways to adapt and support your members through this crisis. Thank you. And to those who've gone out to work every day on the front line so that the rest of us could stay home safely—the people in our supermarkets, our cleaners, the people delivering food to our doors, the Australia Post workers, who we've all looked forward to delivering more and more parcels each day: you've kept us going. Thank you for all your work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Throughout this crisis, I've run a community survey asking people in Jagajaga about their experiences of the pandemic and what they want to come next. I have received around 3½ thousand responses to that survey, and I think that strength of response shows how focused people are not just on what's happening in our community at the moment but on the future they want us to build. The people of Jagajaga have been really clear with me in their responses about what they want to come next, what they've endured through this period and the community they want to build for us, coming out of this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They've told me that their major priorities for what comes next are that we invest in our health systems so that we continue to support all those healthcare workers and those systems that have helped to keep us safe through this period. They've told me that it's vital that we tackle climate change and that we create a renewable energy future—that we realise our promise of being a renewable energy superpower and that we focus on this as part of our recovery. They've also told me how important it is that we invest in education. They know that their kids' future is going to look very different coming out of this pandemic, and that investing in education is going to be a vital way that we can support those who come next and make sure they have the skills to help us all build the future. They told me they want affordable child care. They want Australian manufacturing and support for our local businesses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm here to say that I will be fighting for all of that. I will be fighting for our community to have a stronger future going forward. Through this period they have shown their resilience and their strength, and I again say thank you.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="281688" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr WEBSTER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mallee</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:35</span>):  My electorate of Mallee is one of only nine Commonwealth electorates in Australia that border two states. It is also the only electorate in the country that still has extensive restrictions on both of those borders. When the South Australian government closed the border to Victoria, followed closely by New South Wales, I was gravely concerned for our border communities in Mallee. First, there were challenges with agriculture and seasonal workers; then people were denied access to essential health care. Businesses lost work, families were separated and people were not permitted to attend family funerals.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've heard countless stories of despair and heartache due to these border closures from the residents of Mallee. Brett from Mildura hasn't been able to visit his terminally ill cousin in New South Wales, Wayne from Werrimull has spent months apart from his wife in Adelaide, and Tina from Mildura missed her best friend's wedding. There is also John and Jeanette Fader, in Lillimur. I met with John recently in Kaniva. He is suffering with throat cancer. Access to his treatments and appointments in South Australia has been exceptionally difficult for him. I've had to fight for medical exemptions for some of John's treatments. The fact that he needs to jump through hoops every time a new scan is required, and access to essential health care is being severely limited for him, is disgraceful. It shouldn't be this hard.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These stories persist despite recent changes to restrictions by the New South Wales and South Australian governments. The two state governments have had vastly different approaches to the management of the border restrictions. Although I've maintained throughout this pandemic that the New South Wales border closure is excessive and unnecessary, I must commend the New South Wales government for their responsiveness to the needs of border communities and industries as I've represented them. From the beginning, the Office of the New South Wales Cross-Border Commissioner held daily briefings with members of parliament representing affected electorates. These meetings gave me a direct line to the New South Wales government. They heard our concerns and those of our communities, and responded accordingly. The New South Wales government has created a workable permit system, a responsive hotline available to the public and clear lines of escalation for issues. We've also seen allowances for boarding school students, agricultural permits, exemptions for medical and compassionate reasons and access to the Murray River for regional Victorians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Compare this approach to the South Australian government's administration of their border restrictions. There is no central point of contact within the South Australian government, no cross-border commissioner and no discernible way to escalate or appeal decisions. The exemptions process has been complicated. Its management has been split between SA Health and SAPOL, and these departments clearly do not communicate with each other. Medical exemptions are unobtainable without significant lobbying and are granted for only the most serious of circumstances. Yes, we have seen relaxations on reasons to cross the border within the 70-kilometre border region, but residents in this region need to be tested every seven days should they wish to enter South Australia. Some residents will this week be due for their 16th test, which is a disturbing imposition on individuals who live in a region that has never had a case of COVID-19.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've heard stories of abuse and harassment by South Australian locals directed towards Victorians who have permits to enter South Australia, because their numberplates identify them. Victorians are being treated like lepers, and this is being driven by a campaign of fear dressed up as measures to protect South Australia. The narrative must change. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite their differing approaches, I maintain that both the New South Wales and South Australian borders need to come down. No matter what kinds of changes are implemented, there will always be outsiders. There will always be someone who misses out. The only solution is to remove these restrictions entirely. They say that only when you've said something a thousand times does someone hear it the first time. Well, I will say it again and I will say it a million times until the message is received by the New South Wales and South Australian premiers: these borders need to come down, now. They are destroying lives, they are destroying businesses and they are destroying communities. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lalor</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Opposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:40</span>):  [by video link] I speak tonight from Werribee, in the heart of Wyndham in marvellous Melbourne and the great state of Victoria. I'm sure it's not an overstatement to say that that we who live south of the Murray River are a passionate and parochial bunch when it comes to our great state. But, for many Victorians, like me, I don't think we've been prouder of where we live than over the past three days. As our Premier announced on Monday that Melburnians' efforts had worked, that we had beaten back the second wave and that we are close to victory, it brought a tear to the sternest of eyes. And this afternoon I want to recognise the work and efforts of my community in tackling the virus in our community. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Amid all the good news, I also want to pay tribute to the 67 lives lost in aged care in my community and pass on my sincerest condolences to the families involved and to every family affected by the virus. Some of those lives lost were people I've known all my life. I grew up with their children and have watched their children grow up. I think it is the most painful thing that we will remember from this pandemic. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In mid-August our community's active cases of COVID-19 peaked at 942. One of the reasons why I haven't sought to go to Canberra is that I was in a community of such high transmission. Just over two months later, however, the latest figures today tell us there are only 13 active cases in the city of Wyndham. This is cause for celebration. And, as of yesterday, elements of our usual way of life have begun to return. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The efforts to tackle this virus have been fought by so many Victorians, from our frontline health professionals to the essential workers who couldn't work from home. We have learnt much about what is essential and who is essential in our community and in our economy. Opening up is a win for everybody who washed their hands arriving and leaving the supermarket and who wore their mask on their daily walks. But, unfortunately, not everyone was part of team Victoria as we fought the virus. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite all the platitudes coming from members opposite, some of them weren't here with us and weren't there for us. If the actions of this government over this time have shown us anything, it is that this government is from Sydney and for Sydney. They have picked fights over border closures with states who happen to have Labor premiers but are silent on border closures on Victoria with states who have Liberal premiers. And we had the infamous contribution from the Treasurer on Tuesday—a Treasurer from Victoria who failed to invest and give Victoria its fair share of infrastructure investment in the most recent budget. He cut back support for businesses and employees at the height of this pandemic, which had a direct impact in communities like mine. He cut support for those Victorians who had lost their job. In that contribution on Tuesday, he cried crocodile tears, completely ignoring the fact that, when his government sent in the debt collectors on innocent Australians in the robodebt disaster, it was reported that thousands of them committed suicide after they received illegal debt notices. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we come to another so-called Victorian, the Minister for Education, the minister who cut support for childcare workers before any other industry and hung them out to dry; the minister who cried for how hard year 12 students have had it this year, while smacking them with higher university fees next year; the minister who promised $25 million to support schools during this pandemic, but we can't find a cent spent and we can't find any support for COVID catch-up for Victorian students or any other Australian students. All announcement, no delivery—the defining trait of those ministers. And the failure of this government to be there for Victoria was not limited to Victorian ministers. This was shown most clearly by the absolute failure on aged care that we've seen from this government. Despite the denials of the Prime Minister, the fact is $1.7 billion was cut from aged care. What I saw in my local community and what we read today—PPE not having been given to aged-care facilities when they asked for it and a policy that appears to have been that PPE would not be provided until there was a positive case—have left us with a disaster.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">With that on the record, I want to encourage my community to continue to wash and sanitise, wear masks and social distance as we reopen in Victoria.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs WICKS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Robertson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:45</span>):  I rise today to update the House on the Morrison government's investment in young people in my electorate of Robertson. This includes programs focused on getting our young workers into jobs and ensuring they've got the skills for the future. The opening of an industry training hub in Gosford will provide new opportunities for senior secondary school students to develop skills and learn about local in-demand occupations. The facility is one of 10 around the country that were announced as part of the government's $585 million Delivering Skills for Today and Tomorrow package, which is designed to strengthen the vocational education and skills sector. Each training hub is managed by a full-time career facilitator providing an on-the-ground presence and aiming to improve opportunities for young people, including students in years 11 and 12. Career facilitators will work with and encourage young people to build skills towards employment, creating better relationships and connections between schools and local industry and repositioning vocational education and training as a first-choice option for our students as they leave school.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This vital project is well underway, with the Morrison government releasing a request for tender for the Gosford hub. Kim McLoughry, CEO of Regional Youth Support Services on the Central Coast, said that this hub is a great idea for our region and she was glad to see that the project is industry based and future focussed. Kim said that it was increasingly important to support young people to navigate the jobs market and get the qualifications they need not only for now but also in five and 10 years time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tony Mylan, CEO of ET Australia, which is a training organisation and independent years-seven-to-10 secondary college, said that the industry training hub addresses an important gap in the current system and he especially appreciated its location in Gosford. He said that the hub will act as a facilitator between employers, industry, schools, higher educators and individual students to ensure our young people can explore all options available to them when they leave school.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Through the Delivering Skills for Today and Tomorrow package, the Morrison government has also opened round 3 of the Commonwealth Scholarships Program for Young Australians. This initiative ensures more young people can get industry-based workplace learning and gain qualifications in growth industries across 10 select regions, including the Central Coast. Young people in our region can now apply for up to $5,000 a year to study a qualification and an additional $3,000 to complete an internship. Applications are sought from individuals who are not in full-time work and are aged between 15 and 24 years or those who have left the Australian Defence Force in the past two years. These scholarships work hand in hand with the industry training hubs to help alleviate the financial pressures of education and training while also connecting young people to training pathways and real jobs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that young people are some of the hardest hit by the COVID-19 pandemic. That's why the Morrison government's 2020-21 federal budget includes targeted measures that get young people back into jobs. These measures include the $4 billion JobMaker hiring credit, which will give local businesses incentives to take on additional young jobseekers as the economy recovers. The JobMaker hiring credit will be available for up to 12 months and immediately available to employers who hire those on JobSeeker aged between 16 and 35. This credit supports Australia's economic recovery by bringing forward the hiring decisions of our local businesses so young people can get back into employment as soon as possible. It will be paid at the rate of $200 per week for those aged under 30 and $100 per week for those aged between 30 and 35. Treasury estimates that over the next three years the measure will support the employment of approximately 450,000 people aged 35 and younger. In addition, the government is extending and expanding the supporting apprentices and trainees wage subsidy to include medium-sized businesses who had an apprentice in place on 1 July 2020, which means support for electricians, carpenters, plumbers and other trades to bring on more apprentices. It really represents a great opportunity for young people on the Central Coast. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Having a job means more than earning an income—it means economic security, it means independence, it means opportunity. This government is committed to ensuring young Australians can upskill and reskill to secure a job, and we have a strong plan to address youth unemployment. We're doing this by creating jobs and promoting investment and growth in regional Australia and by putting in place the right policy framework to facilitate stronger jobs growth. This will assist Australians to take advantage of the job opportunities of tomorrow, particularly for young people in my electorate of Robertson.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="008K0" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BYRNE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Holt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:50</span>):  [by video link] Thank you very much, Mr Speaker. It is good to see you, virtually, and to be here today. It's even good to see the member for Scullin! I'll give you a virtual wave. I'm speaking, in these rather unprecedented times, from Cranbourne West, rather than directly, because of the pandemic. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">From the outset, I wanted to talk, in particular, to the people that I represent here in Holt and to thank them for the work they have done in abiding by COVID-safe restrictions and the requirements that have been, we know, onerous for some period of time. We had a situation here in the City of Casey—a large part of which is in Holt— where at the height of the second wave we had 357 active cases. Today we have one. I think that says a great deal of the perseverance, tenacity, sacrifice and commitment of Victorians and people in the south-eastern region of Melbourne. It is an achievement—given that at the height of the second wave in Victoria we had 7,880 active cases and we're down to 87 or less today—that all Australians, not just Victorians, should be proud of. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is clear to me that, now we have successfully seen off this second wave, we must focus on rebuilding and the economic recovery. That is quite essential. Certainly, in that vein, we would encourage Melburnians and Victorians, particularly when the 25-kilometre travel restriction is removed, to come down to some of the attractions in Holt, which include the world-renowned Cranbourne botanical gardens, see the animals in the just-reopened Moonlit Sanctuary, and discover great towns like Warneet and Tooradin. Just come down here and take in the wonders of Western Port Bay, particularly in the summer holiday period. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also wanted to talk about this pandemic, the first wave and the second wave, and re-emphasise the call I made earlier this year for the establishment of an Australian centre for disease control and prevention. Yes, we have seen off the second wave of this pandemic. But, according to organisations like the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services, there's an estimated 1.7 million viruses that are a potential threat to humans that are within the existing populations of mammals and birds. So there is a prediction—from the very same people who predicted five to 10 years ago that there could be a global pandemic—that there may well be another one. That's not something that we want to think about as we collectively come together in this parliament to celebrate the achievements of Australians and Victorians in seeing off the second wave, but forearmed is forewarned and forewarned is forearmed. We do need a consistent mechanism—one mechanism that governs all of Australia. Should a centre for disease prevention be established, I think it could see off some of the inconsistencies that we've seen in some of the health advice that's been provided. But that shouldn't take away from the amazing achievement that the population here in Victoria have been rightly celebrating over the past couple of days as we've eased out of those stage 4 restrictions. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also wanted to talk about something a number of others have spoken about: mental health. On 13 August I hosted a Zoom mental health and wellbeing forum for local residents. We had over 70 people participating. It was auspiced and hosted by Professor Pat McGorry as well as Dean McCaughan—who's the headspace Narre Warren manager—Jemma Schmutter and a very passionate youth advocate, Jake Downward. What came from this mental health forum—notwithstanding the additional federal government and state government funding that has been put into mental services—is that, as a consequence of the pandemic, we need to do a lot more in a coordinated way.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have looked at the concept of one integrated hub in each region. It's something that I know that Professor McGorry has spoken about with Prime Minister Morrison, and it is something that I am calling for today—not something that takes over or takes away from state government mental health services, but something that assists and is an addendum to, something that adds weight to, services. Again, congratulations to all Victorians for the sacrifices they have made in seeing off the second wave. Thanks for the opportunity to speak and see you, Mr Speaker.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="IMW" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr TIM WILSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Goldstein</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:55</span>):  If the royal commission into financial services taught us anything it is that sunlight is the best disinfectant. Last year the Hayne royal commission uncovered immoral practices in Australia's financial services sector, fuelled by a toxic culture of deception. Australians have been misled into buying bad products or had their money raided for exorbitant fees, among many other shocking revelations. Since then the Standing Committee on Economics has been scrutinising the financial services sector to smoke out any further malfeasance and ensure Commissioner Hayne's recommendations are implemented.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Integrity and transparency in our financial services institutions are only more important after COVID-19. With around 800,000 loans, worth approximately $260 billion, currently deferred the actions of our major banks determine the severity of some of the pain Australians experience. Accordingly, the economics committee has required the big four banks to provide monthly updates on how they are responding to the pandemic. The committee has pressed Commonwealth Bank CEO, Matt Comyn, to highlight the savings small businesses can gain from switching to least-cost routing. This will remove many of the fees involved in operating a tap-and-go payment system and ease the burden for small businesses as they rebuild.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee has focused on the legacy of so-called responsible lending laws, which have made it harder for homebuyers and small businesses to access credit. The laws have driven Australians to unreliable non-bank lenders and made big banks more competitive over smaller ones, a classic example of regulation crowding out competition.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee is holding super funds to account to ensure that all Australians' retirement savings are also secure. Your super is your money. Fund managers must adhere to the obligations as trustees of your money. The committee exposed industry superannuation funds for using an illegal loophole to reactivate low-balance, inactive accounts to enable them to charge fees to people who otherwise were unaware. It was a shocking example of industry super charging fees for no service—exactly what they accuse so many other financial institutions of doing, but we caught them with a hand in people's pockets and in the till. Fortunately, the loophole is now closed because of the efforts of the Treasurer and, particularly, the assistant minister for superannuation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Questioning from the committee also exposed that ME Bank, a financial entity 100 per cent owned by industry super funds, failed to inform 20,000 of its customers about changes to its redraw policy. Without warning, Australians had been deprived of their own money at a time of national crisis. What's worse is that ME Bank knew about the intended changes for five months but still chose not to inform its customers. ME Bank also denied that it had been instructed by ASIC to advise its customers of the redraw change—a claim which ASIC subsequently correctly refuted. Of course, logically, the CEO of ME Bank, after questioning, quite rightly resigned. Actions like these undermine public trust in super funds, financial institutions and the integrity of our system. In a display of corporate accountability, ME Bank, of course, saw its CEO resign, but it had a long way to go to rebuild public confidence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee also revealed that industry super had contradicted its own internal research by claiming increases to the compulsory super guarantee wouldn't lower wages or reduce jobs, at a critical time when jobs growth is everything to all those Australians who are unemployed. So industry super has now joined the long waiting list of entities which assert an increase in the compulsory super guarantee will harm Australian workers—whether it's the RBA, the Treasury, the Australian Council of Social Service or the Treasurer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Importantly, the committee is putting pressure on the regulators, ASIC and APRA, to make sure they're doing their job too. Earlier this year we exposed ASIC for publishing and distributing misleading and deceptive data about the cost of running SMSFs. ASIC claimed it cost $13,900. It's much closer to $13,000 annually. That ASIC would publish such highly inaccurate information raises questions about their basic competence. And now, with the recent stepping down of their chair, it's quite clear that that is even more in the focus. A regulator's job is to act without fear or favour, and that is why we have asked for both an audit of the professional backgrounds of their staff and an outcome.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bendigo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:00</span>):  I thought it was important at the end of this week, being such a significant week for Victoria, to acknowledge some of the great work that occurred in my community during the peak of the pandemic. Bendigo was not immune. We did have a few clusters that broke out. But quick, active and committed work by many in our communities saw the clusters and the outbreaks come under control quickly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is no secret that this virus has, in many ways, targeted many of our recently arrived and multicultural communities. Many who work in food and meatworks have been affected. We did have small outbreaks at two of our food outlets, our manufacturers—Don KR, based in Castlemaine, and Hazeldene's. But, because of the work of our community, they were able to get on top of those clusters quickly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to particularly acknowledge the work of the Loddon Campaspe Multicultural Services and the work of the Eaglehawk Community House. Both organisations were contacted by the City of Greater Bendigo after calls were placed to their hotline about people who had been referred who had tested positive and were seeking support. Many of these households did not have their own extended network in Bendigo, because they had recently arrived. Some of them lived in houses with multiple generations, all of whom then became infected. They needed the support of the broader Bendigo community, and Tracey and her team at Eaglehawk Community House and Rose and her team at Loddon Campaspe Multicultural Services stepped up. They ensured that the houses and the people involved had food. They did the mercy runs to pick up extra supplies like medicines and materials that the households would need. They also did welfare checks and ensured that there was culturally appropriate language, making sure they understood what was going on, and that they had appropriate food. This is what our community did to make sure that we got on top of the cluster. I want to thank the individuals involved, not just the people at the community house and the multicultural service who volunteered their time to help these families but also the families themselves. Because they isolated and they reached out and sought help when needed, the virus did not spread. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have now been COVID free for many days in Bendigo and, in fact, in regional Victoria, and it is because of the sacrifice of families like these families that we were able to get on top of these clusters. This is the commitment that it takes. These are the people who have made it possible for the rest of us to get on with living our normal lives. Without that commitment and without that support, I doubt that we would be in the positive position that we are in today.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Robertson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:03</span>):  NorthConnex will be open to motorists this Saturday, 31 October. It is a $3 billion megaproject jointly funded by the Australian and New South Wales governments, and it is going to be a game changer, reducing travel times by up to 15 minutes and allowing drivers to avoid 21 sets of traffic lights along Pennant Hills Road. Motorists will now be able to drive from Newcastle to Melbourne without a single set of traffic lights, not only improving travel for local residents on the Central Coast but also delivering state and national freight efficiencies to assist this vital sector of the economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The project has been built to the highest safety standards, utilising the latest technology to keep drivers safe while also reducing traffic noise and improving air quality. NorthConnex has supported more than 17,000 jobs during the construction phase. These jobs, and the injection of billions of dollars into the New South Wales economy, have been really important during the COVID-19 pandemic. Construction of this important project is now complete, and more than 50,000 tests and checks have been completed so far to ensure that the motorway is ready to open this Saturday.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is one of the most significant and eagerly anticipated road infrastructure initiatives delivered in Australia. Not only has it provided thousands of jobs but it will change the way that thousands and thousands of commuters on the Central Coast travel to and from work each day. David, a local Central Coast resident who commutes to Sydney's CBD every day, said that the opening of NorthConnex will mean less time in the car and more time with his family and friends. He said that it will give him a chance to have breakfast with his wife before work or to take the dogs for a walk along the beach. This is just one example that shows how NorthConnex is more than just a transport link. It's about improving the quality of life of so many hardworking people across our region.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that the opening of the tunnel is also going to help remove up to 5,000 trucks a day from Pennant Hills Road, which is one of the most congested roads in New South Wales. I know that this will be a welcome change for many motorists. Elizabeth from Killcare, who frequently uses this motorway, can't wait for the opening this Saturday. She said to me that she's going to feel safer driving to Sydney to see her family and friends. Elizabeth regularly travels to Sydney to visit her daughter and her grandchildren. She said that this will make the journey faster and more enjoyable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I look forward to attending the opening of NorthConnex this Friday with my colleagues, from both the federal and state governments, and also hearing directly from local residents about how this project will improve their lives as well in terms of travel. While the COVID-19 pandemic has meant that many have had to work from home over the past few months, as locals return to work they will no doubt breathe a sigh of relief knowing that the commute will be made just that little bit easier from Saturday.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Spence</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:06</span>):  Prior to the pandemic and prior to the election, the government undertook a review of the jobactive system. It's a system that I take an interest in because my constituents do need help with employment from time to time. The expert advisory panel to help shape the future design of employment services in Australia found in relation to the jobactive system that a substantial number of jobseekers were able to find work themselves with limited or no employment service provider assistance and that the compliance requirements in many cases didn't just not help the jobseeker but actively hindered them in gaining employment. That's a pretty damning thing from the expert panel. It found that disadvantaged jobseekers were not receiving the intensive individualised support that they needed, because of high case loads. So the system was failing the jobseekers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The report also found that employers also received no assistance from the jobactive system. In fact, they not only found it to be a hindrance but they avoided it like the plague. Human resources managers stay a mile away from it because they know that, if they engage with that system, they are then bombarded with a whole range of material and CVs that are not suited to the types of employment they're seeking.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So we have a system that is failing jobseekers, failing business and failing the community. This wouldn't be such a problem except for the fact that we're spending an enormous amount of money on it—$1.3 billion in 2022-23. If you do a rough calculation you see that, from 2015-16 to 2022-23, $10 billion will be wasted on a system that does not deliver for jobseekers and does not deliver for business. You'd be better off taking $10 billion and burning it in the car park at the Elizabeth shopping centre. This is an absolute scandal.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We should be thinking, as we emerge from COVID-19, about how we can better design these services so that they actually deliver for employers, for industry, for productivity and, most importantly, for jobseekers. All I've seen for many years is a revolving number of employers going through the system—leasing offices, hiring workers and going through the same churn with the same people, making them do the same things and jump the same hurdles for the same pathetic results. We shouldn't be doing this. It's an outrage.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">O'Connor</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:09</span>):  I rise today with a heavy heart, after seeing the front page of Tuesday's <span style="font-style:italic;">Kalgoorlie Miner</span> newspaper. In magnificent blue-green hues, an aerial photograph depicted a circle of over 200 Esperance surfers bidding an ocean farewell to avid local surfer and family man Andrew Sharpe, who was tragically taken by a great white shark on 9 October. The beach and several kilometres of car parks were filled with those paying their respects to a much-loved mate and a valued community member. Andrew was an experienced surfer, with over 40 years in the water. I take this opportunity to convey my heartfelt condolences to his loving family, who understood his passion for surfing and for the Esperance ocean environment. Despite their grief, his family have expressed their gratitude for the actions of those mates who shared the break that day, the first responders, the police and emergency services, and the volunteers who joined the search—which, sadly, did not recover Andrew's body. I would like to add my thanks to those mentioned above and to the entire Esperance community, who have seen this happen far too many times.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There have been five attacks in this area in the past seven years. Earlier this year the diving community lost one of their own. Esperance Dive Club president and avid underwater photographer Gary Johnson was taken by a great white shark while out diving with his wife just off Cull Island. At the time, they were both wearing electronic shark-deterrent devices and were taking photos, not fish. His remains have never been found. After each tragic event, the Esperance community bands together not only to support those who are grieving but to call for more to be done to mitigate the risk posed by sharing their pristine waters with great white sharks.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I take this opportunity to mention, in particular, the Esperance Ocean Safety and Support Group. Comprised of commercial and recreational divers and fishermen, surfers and swimmers, sailors and scientists, they share the experience of the Esperance waters and their encounters with great white sharks. This group's members are proactive, conducting ocean safety information sessions and shark attack first aid courses for their community. They are also contributing to the greater science of great white sharks through the deployment of their own VR2 receivers, which monitor tagged sharks' visitations to Esperance beaches. This group have spent years making representations to all levels of government, working on a strategy that will help protect their community of ocean users long into the future. I thank them for their efforts and stand willing to assist wherever I can in helping prevent further injury and loss of life due to great white shark interactions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To the family and friends of Andrew Sharpe, I reiterate my sadness at hearing of another life lost in such tragic circumstances and extend my sincere condolences.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Rankin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:12</span>):  Two Fridays ago I went to Brisbane airport to meet with ramp workers, ground crew, baggage handlers and cleaners who work there for Qantas. These workers, who love their jobs and work together as a family in lots of ways, are being treated really shabbily by the company and, in my view, by the government, which has left them in the lurch. What has happened here is that all of these workers, who have been trying to do the right thing when it comes to the management of their shifts during a really difficult time for the aviation sector, have been asked to bid for their jobs as the company looks to contract out their work. That is a pretty shameful way to treat these really good workers, many of whom have been there for some decades. I want to acknowledge those workers for their frankness in the way that they conveyed their views to me. I said I would represent their views, as the member for Griffith and the member for Werriwa have, in this place. It is really important that we do. I want to acknowledge as well the Transport Workers Union: Peter Biagini, Adam Carter, Richard O'Sullivan and, at the national level, Michael Kaine—everybody who has been speaking up for and standing up for these workers in a really important part of the economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The problem here is: in this country, under this Morrison government, if you work for Qantas or dnata or any of the airlines at any of our airports, you have been left in the lurch. You have been left behind. You have been left to fend for yourself in this deepest, most damaging recession in almost 100 years. But if you've got a private jet, if you're Clive Palmer or someone else with a private jet, then the government lines up to give you subsidies for flying your private jet around—in Clive Palmer's case, around Queensland, campaigning and lying about things like death taxes and the like. Doesn't that just say everything about this government, with the way that workers in the aviation sector are being treated. People with private jets, whether it's Clive Palmer or the Leppington Pastoral Company or others, are being subsidised at the same time as dnata workers, Qantas workers and others are being left in the lurch. It's really quite a shameful contrast, which speaks volumes about this government and what those opposite think about workers in this country. We say to those workers at Brisbane airport, and indeed at all airports around Australia—the regional ones as well, just as importantly—that we stand with you and we want to fight for you and your ability to work hard and provide for your families. That's all you ask, and it's not too much to ask. In a country like ours, it is the job of government to have a plan for aviation, to have a plan for jobs. You should not be behind while this Morrison government here in Canberra lines up to give subsidies to people with private jets.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Goldstein</span>) (10<span class="HPS-Time">:15</span>):  Superannuation should empower and secure an independent retirement for Australians; it should not be a honey pot for fund managers to fester fees. In this term the House Standing Committee on Economics has exposed disturbing failures by super funds to fulfil their obligations as trustees of Australians' retirement savings. Following questioning, we discovered that some super funds were using a legal loophole to secretly reactivate low-balance, inactive accounts that, by law, should have been transferred to the Australian Taxation Office. By not transferring them, those funds could charge another year of unnecessary fees and insurance premiums. It was their 'fees for no service' moment. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many Australians, particularly young Australians, don't have the time to monitor their super accounts, and these funds chose to exploit the system's complexity. The opaque sole-purpose test has allowed super funds to spend Australians' retirement savings on marketing, advertising, keep cups and days at the tennis, which have nothing to do with returns and everything to do with showering themselves with up to $440 million of largess.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Most disturbing is the seeming arrogance of some funds, their reluctance to even be questioned by this parliament, with some refusing to provide information to the people of Australia. While the big four banks were happy to provide information about the amount they were spending on salaries and severances, IFM Investors refused to clarify reports that they had paid more than $30 million of Australians' retirement savings to a single fund manager in a bonus. They need to be more transparent. It shouldn't become a means to launder accountability to fund members by fund managers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There there's the dodgy data. We hunted down a paper from Industry Super Australia that contradicted their public statements that increasing the compulsory super guarantee wouldn't impact wages or reduce jobs. So now we have Industry Super Australia joining the Treasury, the Grattan Institute and the Australian Council of Social Service as entities who agree that an increase in the compulsory super guarantee would cost wages and jobs. And if there was any doubt, the RBA governor Phil Lowe confirmed it to the economics committee in the middle of this year. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The evidence of systemic problems around accountability and transparency in the super sector has prompted the Morrison government's Your Future, Your Super changes. The reforms will save workers $17.9 billion over a decade. We are preventing unnecessary fees from being charged on multiple accounts. We are introducing an annual performance test for funds to ensure that they're acting in fund members' best interests. We're creating a new website to make sure there is a proper comparison of funds. Your super is your money. We're working to ensure that the system delivers a better deal for all Australians, and we're making sure that some fund managers can't launder their take of your money.</span>

National icons like the koala are at risk, as are many, many more species. Australia is a world leader in extinctions. It's not a very good distinction to have. Labor doesn't want to see a future where our children can only read about koalas in the history books, but that's the path we're on as a nation right now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia was experiencing an extinction crisis even before an estimated three billion animals were killed or displaced in the summer's national bushfire crisis. Australia's environment is in decline. National icons like the koala have died in record numbers. The environment department's funding has been cut by 40 per cent. Successive ministers have run the department into the ground. The Morrison government has very little idea as to what is being done to implement the recovery plans that do exist. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's been estimated that there were up to 10 million koalas when Europeans first started arriving here en masse. But koala populations came under pressure from habitat loss, fire and even hunting in the early 20th century. Thankfully hunting stopped by 1930, though there was still a lot of hunting of koalas in those early decades of the 20th century. But other threats to koalas continued: climate change, fire, habitat loss and disease. What we saw were the koala populations in Queensland, New South Wales and the Australian Capital Territory listed as vulnerable in 2012. The government was meant to have prepared a recovery plan for this vulnerable species by 2015, but guess what: the recovery plan for the koala is now five years overdue. And that's not all. There was a national conservation strategy for the koala that ran from 2009 to 2014, and this government hasn't even got around to replacing that national koala conservation strategy since it expired in 2014.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Academy of Science representatives and others have spoken to me about their concerns that there's simply not enough work being done to monitor and measure threatened species and biosecurity decline, and, of course, we saw that particularly in the wake of the bushfires, where it's estimated by experts that 30,000 koalas died. Labor called for a national ecological audit in the wake of those fires, but, instead of seeing an army of scientists in the field, we saw desktop audits from the Morrison government. And it took the minister until 25 September this year, so a year from when the national bushfire crisis started, to announce that the threatened listing status of the koala would be formally assessed—you'd know, of course, that there are a lot of people calling out for an up-listing of the koala given what's happened with the national bushfire crisis—and that came after the first tranche of bushfire funding took months to roll out, even though it was so-called emergency funding. I visited a range of koala hospitals over the summer and I want to record my thanks again to all those volunteers who really helped the koala over that time. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr YOUNG</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Longman</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:21</span>):  One aspect of this job I really enjoy is when I get to travel around my electorate of Longman and see firsthand the positive changes we are making in the community. The Local Roads and Community Infrastructure Program is a good example of this. The Morrison government has allocated around $20.6 million to Moreton Bay Regional Council under this program. The first round of funding announced earlier this year was just over $5 million, and the second round of just over $15 million was announced in the recent federal budget. The investment will get shovels in the ground on local construction projects, which are important for maintaining jobs and boosting the local economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Four projects in my electorate have already been approved under this program. Summerfields Drive Park in Caboolture will get a significant overhaul under this program, including a new shelter, barbecue and picnic facilities, new shade trees and landscaping, and a play area for the kids. This investment will encourage more families to get outside and spend quality time together and will help increase the sense of community that we have in Longman. Bigmor Drive in Elimbah will get a 2.4 kilometre concrete footpath, which will make it safer for pedestrians to get where they're going and easier for mums with prams and people with mobility issues who use that footpath. Two new fauna crossings and wildlife signage will be installed at Woorim on Bribie Island. This infrastructure will help keep local wildlife off busy roads and inform road users to take more care in those areas. Finally, Bob Brock Park in Dakabin will get new LED sport lighting, which will help the North Pine Sports Club meet the growing demand for their facilities. These projects are all about federal and local governments working together for the community. They support local jobs and boost economic growth in the electorate and they provide tangible benefits to the local communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the Local Roads and Community Infrastructure Program is certainly not the only way we are supporting local councils to deliver local projects. Moreton Bay Regional Council will also receive around $5 million from the Roads to Recovery Program to help them maintain and upgrade local roads. The council can choose the local road projects based on local priorities. Moreton Bay council will also receive more than $17 million through the Financial Assistance Grant program, helping it deliver infrastructure, health, recreation, environmental and employment projects. Again, the council can spend this funding based on local priorities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Every single job we support makes a huge difference in our local community as we build our way out of the pandemic. That is why we have moved quickly to approve funding for these programs so shovel-ready projects can get moving. Initiatives such as these that support local governments to deliver priority projects reinforce the federal government's commitment to job creation and improve the lives of all Australians.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PERRETT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moreton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:24</span>):  I'm proud to be a member of the great Australian Labor Party, surrounded by fine people, like the member for Griffith, who strive to make positive change and wish to make the lives of people in our community better, people who are not afraid to fight for the hard issues. My electorate of Moreton is fortunate to have six hardworking Labor state members of parliament—three men, three women. They are courageous and progressive, but one of them has been the target of unfair and extraordinary abuse during the current state election campaign. Jackie Trad, someone the member of Griffith and I both call a friend, has had her corflutes defaced with sexist slurs and her private property vandalised. Newspapers have devoted countless gallons of ink in disgracefully sniping and attacking this hardworking, progressive Labor woman. The community Jackie represents is eclectic and progressive. I know it well. The member for Griffith has most of it, but some of Jackie's patch is in Moreton. There are professionals, families, students and retired people living in a mix of flats, apartments, houses and crisis accommodation. Jackie has lived locally for 40-plus years. She knows what's important to her community. She lives and breathes our community. Jackie is what a real progressive woman looks like. There's a reason the Murdoch press, conservative forces and even the Greens political party are all trying to unseat Jackie. The conservatives are afraid of what she's achieved, and the Greens want to be just like Jackie.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Jackie is the daughter of Lebanese migrants who settled in Australia with very little. They worked hard and started their own fruit shop. Jackie learnt her work ethic and tenacity from her hardworking parents. Jackie has achieved genuine progressive reform in Queensland. She led the debate on decriminalising abortion, a reform that was a very long time coming. This reform is something the LNP now want to water down. Such a regression would only compromise the health and wellbeing of Queensland women going through an incredibly difficult time. So many progressive reforms have been championed by Jackie Trad: banning gay conversion therapy and promising a vote on voluntary assisted dying. Jackie is courageous. She's the woman you want in the trenches with you. She has her community's back. She knows how tough it is to make change happen and she's never afraid of a challenge. I think she's fearless.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly, once again in this Queensland election campaign, we've seen Clive Palmer throwing money around to influence the vote. You can bet self-interest drives anything Clive Palmer does. Queenslanders are rightly wary of any how-to-vote advice from Mr Palmer. His how-to-vote cards for South Brisbane preference the Greens before the LNP. Just think about that. The dude who profits from coal is asking South Brisbane people to preference the Greens political party because he's scared of Jackie Trad. Locals in South Brisbane need Jackie Trad to represent their interests in parliament because she's effective. So, if you're selfish and live in South Brisbane, vote Liberal. If you want to feel good and achieve nothing, vote for the Greens political party. If you want action and a local champion, vote for Jackie Trad.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Higgins</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:27</span>):  This year's Prime Minister's Prize for Science was won by a team, including Professor Susan Scott from the Australian Research Council's Centre of Excellence for Gravitational Wave Discovery. This team was instrumental in the world-first detection of gravitational waves in 2015, which had been theoretically predicted by Albert Einstein almost 100 years ago. The team was involved in a number of ways, from designing systems to ensuring the stability of high-powered laser beams to developing mathematical models used to identify the source of the first signal detected. As the minister for science, Karen Andrews, said at the awards this morning:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">This year has really reminded us all just how crucial science is to our lives. In the midst of devastating bushfires and the COVID-19 pandemic, we have turned to our scientists to help shine a light on the unknown and map a path for the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need science to help us in amazing discoveries like this, but also in our everyday life, to help us understand problems around us so that we can develop evidence based solutions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate of Higgins, a survey conducted by the Glen Eira City Council found that 96 per cent of residents feel safe or very safe walking alone in the municipality during the daytime, but only 64 per cent of residents reported they felt safe alone after dark. In response to this feedback, I was able to help the council secure a federal grant to invest in new lighting along the popular Rosstown Rail Trail at Rosanna Street Reserve in Carnegie to help provide safety after dark. Walking, as one of the few permitted activities, has been enthusiastically supported through our recent COVID lockdown, and this upgrade has resulted in an extension of the hours people feel safe to use this community facility. I'm particularly proud of the use of solar and LED lights to promote environmental sustainability in our community.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Like many constituents in Higgins, I'm an avid cyclist and love getting out and about in my community and on weekends with my family. I'm delighted the Morrison government has committed $400,000 for a significant upgrade by Stonnington council to the iconic Yarra bike trail in Melbourne, delivering on one of our 2019 election commitments to Higgins. Research tells us how important it is to keep healthy, safe and active. I look forward to seeing this project come to fruition and enjoying a safer bike path for families and locals alike. The Yarra bike trail is iconic for Melbourne and iconic for Higgins. I look forward to science continuing to help keep us healthy, safe and prosperous, now and into the future.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fowler</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Chief Opposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:29</span>):  Since the beginning of October, the Vietnamese people have lived through four catastrophic storm events, including the most recent typhoon, Molave. At least 132 people have lost their lives; over 178 houses have been destroyed, as well as infrastructure. With more torrential rain on its way, over a million Vietnamese residents have been evacuated from their homes. The flow-on effects of these torrential storms, and the major flooding and landslides that have occurred, have been experienced throughout the central region of Vietnam, cutting roads and lines of communication and killing 22 soldiers at a military camp.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The disaster has compounded the economic and health challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, with Christopher Rassi from the Red Cross saying:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">These floods are the last straw and will push millions of people further towards the brink of poverty.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The citizens of Vietnam, particularly through the Hue and Quang Binh provinces, are not wealthy. And now that their homes and their livelihoods have been lost, their situation is completely dire. Although communities in Central Vietnam have had to learn to live with flooding events, the severity of these storms and torrential rains this month means they will need to rebuild entire villages from the ground up.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last Friday, the Australian embassy in Vietnam announced that Australia would provide $100,000 in immediate humanitarian support to the people of Vietnam, which I fully agree with. However, to be quite frank, much more is needed for the Vietnamese to begin to recover. The humanitarian crisis caused by the events of the past month have meant that, before the Vietnamese people can even think about rebuilding their communities, they need emergency shelter, safe drinking water, food and income support. I urge the Australian government to continue providing active and practical humanitarian support to all those who have been displaced, who, no doubt, will be struggling with recovery efforts for some time to come. We have a thriving Vietnamese community here in Australia, particularly in my electorate of Fowler. On their behalf, can I say that we stand in solidarity with the people of Vietnam and offer our sincere condolences on the loss of so many lives and homes as a result of these catastrophic floods.</span>

At Bracken Ridge State High School, Leadership went to Molly Quant, Sporting Spirit went to Callum Brent and Academic also went to Molly Quant—a very hardworking young lady. At Clontarf Beach State High School, Academic Excellence went to Claudia Ryder, Community Service went to Trent Woo and Multi-Disciplinary went to Taj Gardner.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also rise today to speak about the importance of choice and freedom. This weekend Queenslanders have the choice to elect a state government on 31 October. It is a very important choice, because it's about who governs the state for the next four years. One of the biggest frustrations I've had, as a federal MP, is that state governments control the infrastructure and road construction through transport and main roads departments around the country. We can often contribute 80 per cent of the funding, but it's up to the states as to when things start. And in my electorate, it's taking about four years before a sod is turned, which is just way too long. Items like the Deception Bay overpass, that has just started, is as quick as it gets, and that has taken 3½ years just to start. Other roads, like the Linkfield Road Overpass, the on and off ramps at Griffin and Murrumba Downs and the Gateway Motorway upgrade at Bracken Ridge, between Saint John Fisher and Pine River, need to be fast-tracked.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm asking people to support the hardworking Liberal-National Party candidates in Petrie, including Amanda Cooper in Aspley, Phil Carlson in Bancroft, Yvonne Barlow in Murrumba, Kerri-Anne Dooley in Redcliffe and Clark Siemsen in Sandgate. With Deb Frecklington and the LNP, they have a great plan—a big, bold plan—for the economy and the fast-tracking of jobs, including in manufacturing. There's $13 million in grants; building two new big dams to waterproof the state, including running hydroelectricity; providing for 30,000 additional places in after-school care; fast-tracking $80 million worth of investment in roads, which I spoke about; and, finally, establishing a new environmental program that will recycle solar panels and provide $80 million for koala habitat. Only the LNP and Deb Frecklington will get the state moving again.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Makin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:35</span>):  On 18 June I drew attention to the alleged persecution of and denial of natural justice to Julian Assange. Assange is in Belmarsh prison in England. He is being held because the US government has commenced court proceedings to have him extradited to the US to face espionage charges. The charges relate to his alleged role in disclosing classified US documents through WikiLeaks. The court hearing is expected to receive final submissions on 17 November and to hand down its final verdict on 4 January. Assange, who has now effectively been in detention for a decade, is reportedly in poor health, is kept separate from other prisoners and is locked in his cell most of the time. Additionally, he was stripsearched when taken to and from court, had restricted access to his legal team and had difficulty hearing and participating in the court proceedings. I also understand that journalists had their access to the court proceedings restricted and that Amnesty International's permission to attend was revoked. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The International Bar Association has issued a strongly worded statement, outlining several serious concerns with the extradition application. International Bar Association Human Rights Institute director Baroness Helena Kennedy QC commented:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We are concerned that this case is politically charged. We can have little confidence in the extremely polarised situation in the US at present and are concerned that there is a risk to justice in the case of Julian Assange. We hope that the English Court hearing his case is true to its commitment to the rule of law, human rights and justice, and delivers a fair outcome in this extradition hearing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Amnesty International has called on the USA to drop all charges against Assange, stating:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The US government's unrelenting pursuit of Julian Assange for having published disclosed documents that included possible war crimes committed by the US military is nothing short of a full-scale assault on the right to freedom of expression.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The UN rapporteur on torture, Nils Melzer, wrote that never, in the two decades he had spent investigating war crimes, had he ever seen such a ganging up of so many powerful nations against one individual.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Julian Assange is an Australian citizen and should be returned to Australia. He is being punished for exposing war crimes. Regrettably, while global voices condemning his treatment grow daily, it appears that the Australian government is looking the other way.</span>

First of all, the 2020 Mitchell Youth Leadership Forum, in its 19th year, took place on Friday 16 October. Due to COVID, this was the first ever virtual and online youth leadership forum that we've held in those 19 years. Usually this is a 2½-day residential program for year 11 students, based on three values—integrity, service and courage. This alternative format ensured students were still given an opportunity to develop their leadership skills during a year that has needed strong leaders more than ever. We had 160 student leaders from across 13 of my local high schools participating in a virtual keynote leadership session, team-building activities and discussions that this year were held online. Thank you to the schools and all of the principals for your participation in what was a remarkable turnaround, from a physical format to an online format. It was an incredibly flexible concept and plan for a virtual forum. I thank the volunteer leaders and the keynote speaker, Matt Kershaw, who did a great job in supporting all of these young people with this vision. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to take this opportunity to acknowledge and thank our ongoing major sponsor, Nature's Sunshine Australia, the committee of young people who put this together every year and our CEO, Tristan Smith, for their continued commitment to the future of local leaders. The passion and commitment in developing the next generation of leaders is very admirable. These young people really lead the way on behalf of the Mitchell Youth Leadership Forum, and it would not be possible without them. So thank you to all of you. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the issue of champrions, I also want to take a moment to acknowledge a former local junior sports star, from Kellyville, who made his debut at his first Rugby League Grand Final for the Melbourne Storm on Sunday night. Ryan Papenhuyzen is a Hills local and played rugby league for Hills rugby league clubs, and we are very proud of him and his upbringing in the Parramatta Juniors system. He had a cracker of a game. He got the Clive Churchill Medal on the night, and I want to highlight his stellar performance to every young person in my electorate playing rugby league, through all of the junior clubs. And, yes, it is annoying that Parramatta let him go, but that is another issue. I don't have enough time to talk about that today.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is with sadness that I conclude my speech today by paying tribute to the late Linda May Caterson, who passed away at 99 on 13 October 2020. She was the wife of the late Fred Caterson, a former state member for the Hills and a Baulkham Hills Shire councillor. Linda was a remarkable woman of incredible Christian faith who lived through both the Depression and the Second World War. She founded her beloved Hills District Historical Society and gave her passion to it, and my thoughts are with all of her friends in that great society. The Catersons were an iconic part of the Hills, and I note all of our deep sympathies and condolences to the family.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Blair</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:41</span>):  This weekend Queenslanders have a very stark choice: they can vote for Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk and a Labor team that listened to the best medical advice and kept our state safe and our people safe and have a plan to unite and recover this state and its economy, or they can vote for an opposition leader—who just a few months ago was trying to be toppled by the LNP hierarchy in Queensland—who sat at Campbell Newman's right hand and perpetrated cuts and chaos in my local community. Hundreds of nurses, doctors and frontline service providers were cut from the Ipswich community while Deb Frecklington was there with Campbell Newman. It will be Campbell Newman revisited in Queensland if Queenslanders vote for Deb Frecklington and her team. This weekend, I urge my local communities across Ipswich, Somerset and the western part of Brisbane to vote for the Labor MPs in Ipswich, Ipswich West, Jordan and Bundamba and the Labor candidates in Moggill, Nanango, Lockyer and Scenic Rim.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Regardless of the outcome of the election, which I hope will be the re-election of the Labor government, I urge the new Queensland government to work with the Morrison government on a number of important projects in my community. They include, for example, the last section of the Ipswich Motorway. Work is currently being done in Darra and Rocklea, but work still needs to be done from the Oxley roundabout to what we used to call the Centenary Interchange. At the last federal election, Labor committed $500 million towards that project if we won the election. The current federal government, the Morrison government, have yet to commit to that project, but they have form in this regard. All through the Howard years they opposed the upgrade of the Ipswich Motorway from Dinmore through to Darra. It took a Labor government to undertake, design and complete that particular part of the motorway.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another project in my community which is really crucial is the Cunningham Highway upgrade between Yamanto and Ebenezer Creek, which is necessary. Why? Because it is just outside the RAAF base at Amberley, where about 8,500 people work each and every day. It is a pinch point. It is a shocking road. It is notorious. It's infamous. Its upgrade is crucial and critical. But the Morrison government have done nothing about it for the last seven years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to that, we have also got the necessity for the extension of the rail line from Springfield to Ipswich. Again, the Morrison government have done nothing in relation to that, nor have they done anything in relation to significant road funding projects in my community—nor, indeed, by the way, a second crossing of the Bremer River, which is absolutely crucial. The Morrison government has failed Ipswich and my local community.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Parkes</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Regional Health, Regional Communications and Local Government</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:44</span>):  It is vogue to talk of disaster and desperation to grab headlines and gain attention in the hallowed halls here in Canberra, but this approach masks what's happening in regional Australia and undermines the goal of those seeking to highlight the importance of our regions. Regional Australia has done well to avoid community transmission of COVID-19, and outbreaks that have been there have been brought under control very swiftly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we emerge from COVID-19, it is becoming clear that regional Australia will be an engine room for the nation's economic recovery, the foundations of which have always been there. The performance was already strong, and in the context of COVID-19 the cities were turning their attention to west of the divide. I'm not calling it the land of milk and honey; I'm saying that the regions are full of enterprise and full of opportunity backed by great resources and poised to get back in business. The challenges of floods, fires and drought have served to nurture the resilience and grit for which regional Australia is renowned.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">From his humble beginnings, Roger Fletcher has grown a business that exports to dozens of overseas markets. He is one of the largest employers in my electorate and indirectly supports many more. We cannot afford to be standing in the way of economic activity generated by businesses like Fletcher's. Industrial action at the ports has been ongoing and is far from a resolution. Protected stoppages and go-slows at our ports pose a real threat to the connections of Australian businesses to their customers and, more importantly, the security of jobs of Australians through supply chains. Ultimately, they put at risk the COVID recovery.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span style="font-style:italic;" />Just like we want our ports to operate efficiently, the coalition wants to keep out of the way of business. We know that when businesses are left to get on with business then job opportunities will follow. Jobs in regional areas are plentiful. The urgency to find seasonal workers to help with harvest has been well documented, but this downplays the diversity and complexity of our economies in regional Australia. We need people in health, supermarket managers, council workers, civil engineers—the list goes on and on. The Regional Australia Institute estimates that over 45,000 job vacancies in the regions are available now. Between July and August, vacancies are thought to have risen by 14 per cent. Unemployment in parts of central New South Wales in my electorate is said to be below two per cent. Kerrieanne Nichols is an example for all of us. She owns a hotel, restaurant and cafe and operates other venues under licence in Dubbo. She employs a staff of around 50 but needs more. She needs chefs, baristas and floor staff. Before COVID-19, many of these jobs could be filled by temporary visa holders and migrants. It's more difficult to do that now. David Hayes of Dubbo City Toyota cannot find local mechanics to fill his vacancies, with applicants only coming from overseas. Not being able to fill vacancies not only affects his business; it affects those relying on equipment being serviced quickly. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

He implemented a raft of reforms to strengthen institutions and to increase political inclusivity and freedoms. Abiy was awarded the 2019 Nobel Peace Prize for making peace with neighbouring Eritrea after a devastating two-decade conflict, alongside his domestic reforms. Many western powers welcomed the new approach of Abiy, hoping for deep reform in an emerging economic power that plays a key strategic role in a region increasingly contested by Middle Eastern powers and by China.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, just one year on, the Ethiopian leader has a very different reputation. Several experts have voiced their concerns that not only has he failed to live up to his early promises but he has unleashed a wave of repression, locking up those he once freed, advancing a dangerous form of nationalism and indefinitely postponing elections.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The most vocal unrest was in the Ethiopian state of Oromia, where there have been waves of protests since the killing of a popular Oromo artist and activist Hachalu Hundessa in Addis Ababa, the capital. An estimated 180 people died in the violence—some murdered by mobs, others shot by security forces. Private property and government offices were set alight or damaged and several thousand people, including opposition leaders, were arrested. The government says that Hachalu was murdered by Oromo nationalist militants as part of a wider plot to derail its reform agenda, an accusation rejected by the Oromo community. These same Oromo nationalists have since joined the opposition, accusing the Prime Minister of planning to replace the ethnic based federal system with a more centralised state. Tragically, with all this unrest, Ethiopians are experiencing a turbulent transition. </span>

The Oromo members of my community have asked me to request communication between the Australian government and the Ethiopian government to ensure the safety of all Australian citizens currently in Ethiopia. They request that the Australian government: firstly, formally condemn state-sanctioned military and police violence against innocent civilians and protesters; secondly, demand the immediate release of all political prisoners and an end to unlawful imprisonment; thirdly, demand an immediate end of illegal military command posts in western and southern Oromia; fourthly, call for democracy through the timely administration of free and fair elections in 2020; and, fifthly, call on the international community to impose sanctions if the above demands are not met. We must stand for democracy and real political freedom in Ethiopia.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fisher</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:50</span>):  I want to do something a little unorthodox this morning. I invite and encourage my parliamentary colleagues and anyone who's listening to these proceedings at home or at work to close their eyes for a moment, if it's safe to do so. Picture that you are with your family on an aircraft in the Middle East. You're not told the reason for the delay, but hours have gone by and your aircraft, which is due to fly to Australia, hasn't left. No-one is telling you why. All of a sudden authorities come on board the aircraft and demand that your wife and your daughters leave the aircraft with them. The women are required to accompany them. No-one explains why. Nothing is said other than that they're required to go with them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Once off the aircraft the women are subjected, against their will, to invasive searches of their genitalia. No explanation whatsoever is given to them as to why. The invasion of the privacy of those women is unspeakable, but imagine if you were a 14- or 15-year-old girl. No explanation was given. They're taken to an ambulance, told to lie down and take off their panties. This is in 2020 in Qatar. These unspeakable actions have been taken against 13 Australian women and, I understand, another five women from other countries. This reprehensible behaviour by someone—and we don't know who yet; we don't know whether it was the Qatari authorities—that happened on 2 October cannot go unchallenged or unpunished. Australian women have been violated. We need to do more. We need to find out what happened. These women deserve apologies and so much more.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="53517" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr DICK</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Oxley</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:54</span>):  Today I wish to acknowledge and celebrate the life of Wendy Brittain. Wendy was a community leader, much loved and respected by all of those she worked with. She was passionate about gardening and she used this and the environment to bring our community together. She founded the Oxley and District Garden Club 35 years ago. It was her fantastic idea to use gardening to bring like-minded people together. Founded alongside another respected Oxley local, Shirley May, the group had events through the year. I was proud, during my time as a local councillor, to be appointed as co-patron alongside Wendy. Of all the groups I'm involved with and honoured to be patron of, this would be my favourite.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Wendy also ran the Sherwood Neighbourhood Centre markets and was the past president of Queensland Quilters, where she specialised in mini quilts that would be donated to Blankets with Love. When I spoke with Mrs Lorelle Palaszczuk—the mother of Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk, a member of the club and a friend of Wendy's—she told me how she used to go and collect beautiful mini quilts from Wendy, each one made uniquely and creatively with love.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Around 10 years ago, when I was the councillor for Richlands and representing the suburb of Oxley, Wendy, alongside her husband, Ray, and other local residents came to me with an idea to form a bush care group around the park where they lived, at Rikki Bailey Park. At the time I was an opposition councillor and Campbell Newman was the lord mayor. Basically the way the council worked was: if a Labor councillor suggested something, Campbell Newman did the opposite. So I wasn't particularly confident I was going to get this bush care group up. I went to the residents nervously—I was a new councillor—and said, 'Look, I think it might be a little bit difficult with the politics and Campbell Newman.' Wendy, with a twinkle in her eye, said: 'We've got faith in you, Milton. I'm sure you'll get it done.' With those efforts and that support, we were able to find a way to get the group up and running. Those efforts have improved the natural areas, and the bush care group created a safe environment for Brisbane's unique wildlife. In March this year I was proud to celebrate the 10th birthday of the Rikki Bailey Park Bushcare Group.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Wendy spread friendship through gardening. It was a joy to know her and work alongside her in the community. She was loved by everyone in our community, and they have such fond memories of the joy she brought them. When Bronwyn Rigby told me of her passing, I was really sad. This Sunday I will be going for a walk with the Rikki Bailey Park Bushcare Group along their parkways to think of Wendy and honour her memory.</span>

Dr Craig, Dr Rosic and their business partner, Gerard Criss, have developed groundbreaking Australian wound-healing technology. The Rapid Repair wound-dressing product is a thick black silicon strip. It is placed over a wound and can repair wounds in days rather than weeks. It acts as a fine virtual skin scaffold over damaged skin, reducing the need for stitches, staples and glue in many clinical situations. Dr Craig first tested the product on herself, when she suffered an accidental cut several years ago, and saw a remarkable improvement in the result. Last year the first clinical trial of 30 people was completed, and the team is preparing for the second trial to begin this month in partnership with the University of Queensland.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The NASA competition involved two days of pitching and interviews over video calls with a panel of NASA's chief technology officers and investors in the United States. Dr Craig said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">We are thrilled with this outcome from the competition. It's very powerful not only in validating the science from the clinical trials, but also validating our plan to commercialise this product in 2021.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The old Grafton Bridge is an iconic landmark in our community. The 88-year-old, 70-metre, double-deck road and rail bridge is the only one of its kind in New South Wales. It spans the mighty Clarence River and joins Grafton and South Grafton. It opened in 1932—in fact, the same year as the Sydney Harbour Bridge. Our very own bendy bridge, as it's known, has two levels. The upper level is used to carry general street traffic, while the lower level is used as a rail bridge. There are also two pedestrian footpaths. It also supports the water main. The bridge was an amazing engineering feat in its time. The bend in the bridge ensures the train tracks and the road diverge when connecting to the bank. It also has a drawbridge, which was in operation from its opening in 1932 until 1969.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Grafton bridge was placed under heritage listing in April 1999. The bridge is assessed as historically, scientifically and socially rare. So while it's wonderful to see the great new Grafton bridge—I acknowledge my state colleague Chris Gulaptis for that—our very own bendy bridge will continue to have a place in our hearts and is still very important for both train and local traffic. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Barton</span>) (11<span class="HPS-Time">:00</span>):  Two years ago we said sorry to survivors of institutional child sexual abuse. We said to them, 'We hear you and we believe you.' We made a commitment to delivering redress—redress that is timely, redress that does not retraumatise, redress that survivors can have confidence in. Today we reaffirm that commitment. We also acknowledge the work of many brave people and advocates through the royal commission, the national apology and the National Redress Scheme. They made it a reality. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Survivors have been through so much and have waited so long. We have to get this right. Eight years since the announcement of the royal commission and two years since the apology, survivors in many cases are still waiting for redress. Many are ill, dying, and missing out altogether. To them—<span style="font-style:italic;">(Quorum formed)</span> Particularly to institutions we say: do the right thing and, if you're named in an application for redress, sign up. We are also arguing very strongly that the cap should be $200,000, as recommended by the royal commission, not the $150,000 that the states and the Commonwealth have agreed to. It really does defeat the purpose of the scheme if survivors are not part of the scheme. The scheme was designed to make things easier for survivors. It says a lot about the current state of the scheme that people are actually taking the civil path. The redress matrix is absolutely unworkable. It has been widely criticised and needs redesigning. This was a noted departure from the original recommendations of the royal commission.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to take this opportunity to also briefly note what we learnt at last night's Senate estimates: 52 survivors passed away before payments were made; the average processing time for an application is between 12 and 13 months; 61 institutions that have been subject to an application for redress are now defunct; and 10 breaches of privacy of survivors have occurred since the scheme began. It's a difficult, painful and complex process—we understand that—but we mustn't forget that our paramount duty to survivors is to get it right. Many of the deficiencies of this scheme arise from the fact that the scheme does not reflect the original recommendations of the royal commission. We should also ensure that governments act as funders of last resort for institutions which are now defunct or have no present-day entities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are arguing for an advanced payment scheme for people that are old and unwell, much like the scheme in Scotland. We are, as I said, arguing to lift the cap on redress payments, and to ensure that prior payments are not indexed when calculating redress payments. Prior payments which do not relate to institutional child sexual abuse, such as payments to the members of the stolen generations, should not be deducted from redress payments. That's just an outrage. The redress assessment framework must be also reformed to properly recognise the impact of abuse when calculating payments. Survivors should be able to rest assured that, should they ever seek a review of their payment, the end result won't be a reduction in their payment. The National Redress Scheme is the result of the hard work, advocacy, courage and bravery of so many, and it is an important scheme. We owe it to survivors to get it right.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the second anniversary of the national apology, let us renew our commitment to the Redress Scheme, let us renew our commitment to survivors and let us remind ourselves that there are many people out there who deserve redress and are not getting the redress that they deserve, and that goes very much to the heart of the matrix and the way in which the application process is designed. It should be designed so that people get the maximum payment they are due, and they should get support to fill out the application. The pain is very real, and we must get this right.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr STEPHEN JONES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Whitlam</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:11</span>):  The Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse was a watershed moment in Australia. Because of it, we now know the horrible crimes committed by the powerful against the powerless and the innocent. The royal commission opened our eyes. It forced us to examine something so evil that for so many it was hard to believe that it could be true. Because of it, we all now do. The acknowledgement returns a modicum of power to those who had their childhoods stripped away from them by the very people they should have been able to trust the most. Compounding the unspeakable acts committed on our children was the tragedy that for many decades the crimes were covered up and the victims were not believed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's easy to think now, two years after the apology, years after the first hearings of that royal commission, that the holding of a royal commission into these historical abuses was somehow inevitable. After 1,300 witnesses and 8,000 private sessions hearing the testimony of survivors, the evidence of these crimes is overwhelming in its scale and overpowering in its detail. But it wasn't inevitable. It was resisted tooth and nail in this parliament and elsewhere. When those witnesses came forward and the evidence unfolded, we began to understand why: barbaric acts that can only be described as torture and rape committed by some of our society's most powerful institutions on innocent people—our children. This was magnified by the culture of denial and deceit by churches and other institutions. The acts robbed them of their childhood. The churches robbed them of their faith in justice and their faith in faith itself.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's worth reflecting on the experience of a child who has no language to describe the despicable acts, no words to cry out, no-one to turn to. The pain and suffering is theirs and theirs alone to endure. For those who were able to summon the courage to try and express the horrors that they'd experienced, they were believed. Indeed, compounding this injustice, the victim so often became the accused. They were accused of lying, of making it up, of besmirching the reputations of those who stood at a pulpit or stood in a powerful place. Those people should have been locked up. They should have been sent to jail. Instead they were moved on to somewhere else to commit their crimes again and again and again. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Too often the shattered trust and broken souls these crimes wrought were passed down in a barely traceable chain of suffering from one generation to the next. These are generational crimes. Because of the royal commission, we know something of the price our society paid for the retributions visited on those that were abused, and we still ask this: what did churches and schools and orphanages gain from the cost and the misery that they extracted from so many lives? The answer is pretty simple: protection of power and reputation—and their institutions' reputation over those who were held in their trust. Those were their priorities, not the protection of the young children in their care. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The power of  the national apology to those children that came after and because of the royal commission finished its work. It's something that we in this place should all be very proud of. It was an important moment, but one that will ultimately be undermined if we don't follow through. The only action that can truly demonstrate to the survivors of abuse is a redress scheme that works as the royal commission truly intended it to. The member for Barton outlined a series of shortcomings between the scheme that was recommended by the royal commission and the one that was adopted by the government. We need to make the scheme more straightforward—for example, by allowing the relevant minister to declare a church or organisation by its name rather than by its subsidiaries. We must streamline the process by which redress payments are made, and we must authorise the disclosure of protected information about institutions that continue to decline to participate in the scheme. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The royal commission estimates that around 60,000 Australians could be eligible for redress—60,000. It's a staggering figure. At the current rate of applications, it will take the scheme 45 years to get through the backlog for proper justice for all of those victims. It doesn't take a genius to work out that in 45 years so many of those victims will have already passed on, perhaps not without passing on the horrors and the disadvantage to another generation of young Australians, which is why it's so important that we get this right. It's clear the application process is difficult to navigate. Survivors are getting old and in many cases have ongoing health complications. Average processing times are between 12 and 18 months. This is not good enough for a population that has already endured so much; neither is the process that allows institutions to opt out of providing redress through this scheme. More must be done to force these institutions to get on board. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The time for the benefit of the doubt is long gone. These issues are of real concern to me and my community. I've spoken many times in this place about the school I attended and the community I grew up in, and how perpetrators were moved from one school to another, from one town to another, to continue their crimes, covered up by institutions and schools who cared more about the reputation of the institution than the children that were abused. For the sake of the children, for the sake of the victims and survivors, we must get this right.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macquarie</span>) (11<span class="HPS-Time">:23</span>):  Two years ago this parliament said the words that so many survivors of institutional child sexual abuse needed to hear: 'We believe you.' Their willingness to share their stories through the royal commission revealed abuse, violation and horror, which so many had carried in silence for decades. They revealed the power that had been used to silence them, as children and as adults, by institutions that had promised to care for and protect them—institutions like churches, clubs and charities. This was a national shame, and this parliament apologised. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But an apology was only the start. Even now some institutions do not accept their responsibility. They have not signed up to the scheme. As is appropriate, the government is talking about naming those institutions, but it could go further. Institutions who refuse to participate deserve a higher penalty, like losing their tax deductibility status. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Blaxland resident Glen Fisher gave evidence at both the Wood royal commission in the nineties and the one we're speaking of today. He spoke of his experience of being abused both physically and sexually while in refuges, homes and foster care, and during his recovery from heroin addiction. His evidence led to the conviction and imprisonment of several of his abusers, and additional cases are still underway. But it wasn't the royal commission that gave him closure; it was publishing a book last year, <span style="font-style:italic;">Predator's Paradise</span>, about his experience. Glen runs groups for people who've been abused and wants to show them that it is possible to survive. The father of five and grandfather of five says he wants people to know it's safe to speak up. As Glen told me, survivors of abuse don't need to live in silence and fear. The shame doesn't belong to them. The shame belongs to their abusers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Numerous lawyers have told Glen that he doesn't meet the criteria to be considered eligible for the Redress Scheme, but that doesn't stop him being concerned about the way the current processes are hurting people. He says the retelling of stories has been really damaging for some and redress is causing even more pain. The complexities of the system, he fears, are overwhelming some survivors. The Redress Scheme has received more than 8,200 applications and paid out more than $315 million, but the wait for payments is long, and we want to work with the government to improve this system.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of my constituents wrote to me this week of his experience in trying to lodge an application for redress: 'I lodged an application for redress with the National Redress Scheme on 7 April. Upon lodging the application, I received a brief phone call acknowledging receipt of my application. Approximately six weeks later, I called to inquire as to the progress of my application. I was told that my application looked great and was progressing well and if I didn't hear anything I should call back in a week. There was no contact, so I called again after a week. The person I spoke to this time told me that I should not have been told to call back, that I had to wait for further contact from the scheme. When I inquired as to how long it would be or even how long the process normally takes, I was told that they couldn't give me any information at all regarding time frames.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And he went on: 'I called two weeks ago, around about 1 October, and went through to voicemail. I left a message requesting a call back. A week later I had not had a response, so I called and left another message. Both of these calls were made during business hours. I then received a call later that same day, responding to the first call. I was told again that there was no information that could be shared with me.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He goes on to say that people lodging these applications have been forced to relive and describe traumatic experiences, often having felt that the institution involved with the original abuse was not likely to act on the abuse. The lack of information and clarity around expected time frames, he says, and the lack of feedback from the scheme can feel like another institution putting bureaucracy ahead of victims' needs. He says, 'I'm not asking for my application to be fast-tracked. I just need clarity around when I should expect a resolution. If I'm feeling like this, I'm sure there are many others who are also feeling this way and not speaking up, out of a sense of hopelessness.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those words shared with me just earlier this week illustrate the problem that people are finding, but it's not a lone experience. The process is bureaucratic. Survivors are ageing and they are feeling overwhelmed. As of September the scheme was still processing 3,187 applications. As the ongoing work of CLAN, who did so much in the lead-up and during the royal commission, and that of other advocate groups shows, the Redress System is not yet achieving the aims laid out by the royal commission.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a number of changes we'd like to work with the government on to make it a better system. The matrix used to determine payments is arbitrary and needs to be fixed. The cap on payments should be lifted to $200,000, as recommended by the royal commission. The ongoing psychological counselling and support for recipients needs to be increased. There's a need for an early release scheme, similar to that which operates in Scotland, so that people over a certain age or who are unwell can receive an early payment or part-payment so they receive something in their lifetime. We've recently learned that, if you're from the Stolen Generation and received a payment under that process, that payment is deducted from your redress payment. That's simply wrong and an insult to people who have suffered immeasurably. We also need to see the Commonwealth commit to be a funder of last resort for those institutions that no longer exist or don't have the resources to provide redress. People who were abused as children in those institutions shouldn't be penalised because the responsible organisation is no longer around. And there needs to be provision that, if people ask for a review of the amount they've received, the reviewed amount can't be any less than they were originally given.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The royal commission was about justice. It began in 2012, and the report on redress was released in 2015, with a final report in 2017. The commission has carried a heavy load. There were 42,000 calls handled, 26,000 letters and emails received, 8,000 private sessions held, and 2,500 referrals to authorities, including police. As the commission said in its final report:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">For victims and survivors, telling their stories has required great courage and determination.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It noted that they'd also heard from parents, spouses and siblings about the abuse of their relatives, many of whom had died, sometimes by suicide. To those survivors, we use the second anniversary of the apology to repeat: it was never your fault, and you have nothing to be ashamed of; you did nothing wrong. It is this parliament's responsibly, and it will remain this parliament's responsibility, to do everything we can to see that what was recommended for these people by the royal commission, what was promised by this parliament, is delivered.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Newcastle</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:31</span>):  It is an incredible privilege to be able to rise in this House to make a contribution to this motion regarding the second anniversary of the national apology to the victims and survivors of child sexual abuse. It's a little over two years ago that this House became the centrepiece of that apology. There were survivors from across the nation who had travelled to Canberra to bear witness to this parliament's unconditional apology. This was an incredibly important moment in our nation's history. I wish to acknowledge a number of events that really led us to the point of a national apology in parliament. Many of my colleagues have touched on this in the debate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the outset, I wish to pay tribute to the work of the royal commission. I don't think we can ever overstate the significance of that royal commission in terms of the forum that it provided to really shine a light on what had been a terribly dark and shameful part of this nation's history. A number of acts were required in order to get a royal commission in the first place. It's at this point that I want to acknowledge the former Labor Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, who, against extraordinary pressure from very powerful vested interests, signed off on committing this nation to a royal commission on the eve of losing her office. It was one of the last acts she committed as the Prime Minister of this nation and it will be part of her enduring legacy. There is another Prime Minister that I need to acknowledge, who is no longer in this place either, and that is Malcolm Turnbull. I do so because it was under Malcolm Turnbull's leadership that the parliament agreed to the process of a national apology. He formed the National Apology Reference Group, which I and three other parliamentarians were very privileged to be part of, along with wide ranging representation from survivor groups, that provided the Prime Minister of the day—and it was Malcolm Turnbull for a significant part of our work—with some direction as to the—</span>

                  </a>  I'll pick up where I left off. I was acknowledging the work of the former Liberal Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull in establishing the National Apology Reference Group, which I was very privileged to be part of, along with Steve Irons—a member of this House—former senator Derryn Hinch and current Greens Senator Rachel Siewert. In addition to the parliamentarians there was a diverse group of representatives of survivors. I want to acknowledge my fellow National Apology Reference Group members: Cheryl Edwardes, the chair of the reference group, from Western Australia; Caroline Carroll; Christine Foster; Craig Hughes-Cashmore; Hetty Johnston; Leonie Sheedy; and Richard Weston.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reference group undertook a really extensive consultation program. We had 58 face-to-face consultations around Australia and took a very significant number of submissions in order to help provide advice to the Prime Minister—as I mentioned, it was Malcolm Turnbull that we were providing advice to at the time—to ensure that the apology, as much as possible from the government's point of view, would reflect the wishes of survivors. Regretfully, on the eve of the apology, there was a change of leadership and Malcolm Turnbull was no longer Prime Minister. So that work had to very swiftly transition across to advising the current Prime Minister, Scott Morrison. To the current Prime Minister's credit, he delivered an apology that went a long way to addressing the issues that had been raised through our reference group consultations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I really want to bring attention, given that this is the second anniversary of that national apology, to one of the very core components of the advice that we provided to both prime ministers. That was that the national apology needed to be meaningful and, importantly, supported by real, concrete, substantive action to bring about powerful, lasting reform that would ensure that, as far as possible, that level of systemic child sexual abuse would never re-occur in this fashion. While I appreciate that it is difficult to say the word 'never' in this context, that absolutely must be the goal that we all seek to achieve. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to put on the record my concerns around the lack of progress that this parliament and the Australian government, in terms of its leadership, have made in ensuring that the National Redress Scheme, which was one of the critical components of our response to the royal commission recommendations, lives up to the expectations of what that redress scheme should be. It really is lacking in so many ways, and I am deeply worried about its capacity to live up to the expectations of the survivors of child sexual abuse as to what the Redress Scheme should be. Their expectations are very grounded in the actual royal commission recommendations. As I have said before in this chamber—and it is worth repeating—each and every time the government have chosen to deviate from the actual recommendations of the royal commission, they have done so to the detriment of survivors.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is very timely for this parliament to reflect on this now. We will soon be debating some amendments, I believe, to the National Redress Scheme, and I am forever hopeful that the government will indeed take on some of the big reforms that are necessary. I have tabled in this parliament reports in April 2019 and recommendations in April 2020 that have given this government every piece of advice and guidance that they require to make the National Redress Scheme the scheme that the royal commission envisaged it to be. I know that the shadow minister, Linda Burney, is negotiating with government to try and get bipartisan support for key reforms to the Redress Scheme. It is appalling that it is not survivor focused and guided by trauma informed practice; that must be at the centre of the Redress Scheme. Labor and survivor groups have long argued for a change to the matrix to increase the cap, to ensure that nobody can be disadvantaged if they seek review. There is much work to be done and there is no time to waste. Frankly, I have tabled way too many reports with way too many recommendations for this government to refuse to listen any further.</span>

                  </a>  I will try for the third time, Deputy Speaker Freelander. Colleagues, I was talking about when I addressed the House two years ago, and I was talking about how it really was a deeply emotional day to have the parliament come together to deliver that national apology for victims of institutional child sexual abuse. The apology was right. We understood that. Not only was it to express sorrow for what had occurred to children, but, more importantly, that this all occurred under our collective watch. We were sorry for our ignorance and, probably above all, sorry for our collective failure to listen to children. Clearly, as a nation, we, at that stage, accorded more respect, more trust, to those in authority than to the children under their care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I remember I spoke about how I found it utterly incomprehensible that people of faith could perpetrate such evil against innocent children, all the while hiding behind their positions of trust within their communities. I also recall talking about my cousin who, like me, grew up in a deeply religious family. We both attended Catholic schools, but, unlike me, his experience was vastly different. He was a victim of abuse. For his benefit and, moreover, I think, so this place could properly understand what had been undertaken and what he had gone through, I undertook to read his words to the parliament. I will quote his words now: 'My name is Anthony, and I am a survivor of childhood sexual abuse. I'd like to express my gratitude for the opportunity to share some of my story and to continue with my healing journey. Trust is a major feeling that is lost as a result of sexual abuse. My abuse was at the hands of a Catholic priest, a person I was taught to trust without question. It is, therefore, extremely difficult for me to trust myself, let alone anyone else. I felt like some trust was beginning to grow for me in the process of the royal commission and the apology to survivors and victims of the horrendous crimes that were perpetrated against innocent children like me. 'The process of the royal commission was amazing, an opportunity to be able to speak about the abuse and also to be heard in private session with Commissioner Bob Atkinson. I was working as a principal in Catholic education when I was able to face my abuse. Working hard to become a principal was my attempt to show that I could cope with the abuse, and I was driven to change the system that allowed me to be abused. It became too much for me, because of the ongoing hypocritical nature of the institution regarding children and how they run schools and churches.'</span>
