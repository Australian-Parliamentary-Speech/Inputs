      <para>
       The petition of the undersigned shows the very deep concern of people in the community against the proposed AIDEX exhibition of weapons of war in our country. We firmly believe that it is not in Australia's interest to become dealers in death and destruction. Particularly at this time when our planet's environment is in a parlous condition and demands statesmanlike leadership to the world on its rehabilitation. We therefore ask that:-
      </para>
      <para>
       The Exhibition to take place be one which shows instead the ways in which we aim to overcome the dangers to our world from poisoned soil, air and water by high-lighting the need for tree-planting, solar-powered homes, electric cars, et cetera as a means of attacking the global warming and other hazards to our fragile environment.

         â€”As Deputy Chairman of the Standing Committee for Long Term Strategies, I would like to thank the dynamic and thought provoking Chairman, the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones), for without the influence of my honourable colleague I would not have been fortunate enough to undergo the learning experience that membership of this Committee has proved to offer. Not only has it proved to be an inspiring and mind expanding exercise; it has also afforded me an insight and an education into a topic which is at the same time complex, intricate and exciting. I believe that all my colleagues in the House might be similarly inspired were they to read the report themselves. It comes highly recommended.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        It is not without significance, for example, that the glossary of this report is found at the front and not at the back. I believe that is appropriate because a great deal of the terminology has yet to find universal acceptance and filter its way into our day-to-day vernacular.
       </para>
       <para>
        Whether we like it or not, greater usage of this terminology will occur. Well may we complain, as purists and aesthetes, at this deplorable and awful linguistic sanitisation, this ghastly melange of buzz words. However, these words are here to stay, whether we like it or not. On a practical level, we will have to come to terms with these buzz words. It is inevitable.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is vital for us and our children, for example, to understand exactly what is meant by terms such as `paradigms'-currently top of the hit parade in buzz words-`informatics', `data systems', `synergies', et cetera, and to understand the meaning and significance of terms such as `information systems', `information economy', `information employment', `information industries', `information revolution, society, technology and theory', and so on. As my honourable colleague from Lalor pointed out:
       </para>
       <para>
        Australia is an information society. Forty per cent of the labour force is employed in the collection, processing and dissemination of data or knowledge. This is more than manufacturing, construction, agriculture and mining, combined.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is an astonishing figure, whichever way one may care to look at it.
       </para>
       <para>
        The House of Representatives Standing Committee for Long Term Strategies was formed on 31 May 1990, and the inquiry into Australia as an information society was commenced soon after, with the specific objectives of adopting a national approach to the formulation of an information policy. The Committee will bring down two further reports in the spring session, the second being the role and capacity of libraries as providers of information and the third will analyse the problems faced by members of parliament in coming to terms with technical issues.
       </para>
       <para>
        Australia as an information society was tackled first, simply because of the relative urgency of the matter. Indeed, the report highlights the current disparate and uncoordinated state of discussion on information policy in this country. The report was therefore commenced with the specific objectives of inquiring into and reporting on the desirability of adopting a national approach to the formulation of an information policy.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am reminded at this juncture of Alvin Toffler's controversial book Future Shock, which caused such a furore worldwide in the 1970s and in the early part of this decade. For those not familiar with Toffler's book let me briefly explain. Toffler, in writing about change and people's abilities to adapt, foreshadowed a spate of change that was to sweep the whole Western world and indeed the whole globe.
       </para>
       <para>
        On such lofty subjects as the death of permanence, the acceleration of technological change, over choice, education and technology and the profound social implications that accompany this dearth of information, many of Alvin Toffler's predictions, whether we agree with his tenets or not, are in some way relevant to this report, because what we are talking about here is essentially change and our society's adaptability to change.
       </para>
       <para>
        We cannot deny that we are being bombarded daily with information. As parliamentarians we, as much as anyone in the community, are extremely well placed to know what it is to be so bombarded, by information through the media, information through our staff, constituents and colleagues-not to mention the endless reams of paper we receive through the mail. Paper, paper, and more damned paper-all of it containing information, some useful, some not at all. How to sift through it all is indeed one of the bugbears of our position. How many of us have not, at one stage or another, experienced a sense of alienation or frustration brought about by this unending flow of information?
       </para>
       <para>
        What the report attempts to do is to put a national perspective on this information explosion. We are witnessing what is nothing short of a global phenomenon. The report addresses some key and fundamental issues regarding Australia's role in what is going to be a highly competitive twenty-first century. Firstly, it raises the question of whether we as Australians want to respond to this as a nation or take a more flexible and loose knit approach.
       </para>
       <para>
        Secondly, I believe that the report raises the very important philosophical question of the right to know. Is information a commodity that should be freely available to everyone, or is it something that is precious and should incur a fee? Have we the right to squander information that was obtained at substantial effort and expense? Information is, after all, a commodity like any other; a commodity with costs involved. Where and with whom should ownership of this precious resource lie?
       </para>
       <para>
        It is in this report that issues of copyright and intellectual property, privacy legislation, and equity in information access and transfer are dealt with. The report also deals with other issues such as scientific and technological information, media ownership and control, information and education, the role of our libraries, and a whole gamut of interrelated issues.
       </para>
       <para>
        In putting Australia clearly within the `information society' camp, the report includes us within a rather formidable club. `Information society' and `information economy' are terms which denote an economy in which a high and rising proportion of the labour force is employed in the collection, processing and manipulation of data. Those terms are assigned to us, in company with countries such as the United States of America, Great Britain, France, Japan, Italy, Canada, Sweden, the Netherlands and Switzerland.
       </para>
       <para>
        Clearly we have our work cut out for us, since the report also describes Australia as a passive information society. In other words, in information technology we are net importers, creating a trade deficit in information technology of between $4 billion and $8 billion per annum. The report also points out that, while we rank with Japan as the most urbanised country in the world, our export base remains predominantly rural and mineral. It would seem that our cities, in spite of their relatively developed information infrastructures, make a fairly insignificant contribution to exports.
       </para>
       <para>
        The situation is changing, but clearly we are not in the same league as countries such as Sweden, Switzerland and Holland, which have highly developed ideas and information-based economies. Indeed, if we are to become the `clever country', then a report such as this one is an appropriate starting point at which to go about setting up the building blocks for a strong and meaningful future for this nation in the information world.
       </para>
       <para>
        The report contains several recommendations that I do not intend to delineate here in the short time available. However, I do urge colleagues to read the report since the subject matter is both absorbing and exciting. A certain sense of urgency is conveyed with regard to the growth and volume of information experienced by our society. This information is important to us because it is fundamental to our independent economic growth, stability and well-being, and without it we would find ourselves adrift and isolated from changes occurring elsewhere in the world.
       </para>
       <para>
        If we as a nation are to remain competitive and want to continue to make significant contributions to the betterment of humanity as a whole, then a grasp of the fundamentals of the global information flow is crucial. The individual in our society cannot escape these changes. He or she is inescapably, profoundly affected. None of us can hope to be insulated by the change, but we do have an ability to remain masters of these changes. It is vital that we ensure that these changes work for the good of the individual and not for their enslavement.
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr Speaker, we do run out of time in these debates, despite having been allowed a long time by the Committee. Let me just say in conclusion that all Australians, regardless of gender, sexuality, race, language, culture, creed or age have a fundamental right to know what information resources are available to them.
       </para>
       <para>
        In closing, I would like to thank the Committee's staff for their indefatigable efforts in producing this first report: Mrs Margaret Swieringa, Ms Kellie Fitzsimmons and Ms Jillian Menham for their efforts in the production of the report. Lastly, I would like especially to thank Mr Ian Dundas for putting together what I believe to be a commendably objective report.

I hope we have in some way managed to convey the importance and excitement that the information age may usher in for all of us, and particularly for the generation of Australians coming of age in the twenty-first century. It is my hope that we can all work together to build a cleverer Australia. Let us, however, bear in mind that information is not knowledge and knowledge is certainly not wisdom.

         â€”I would like to say what a pleasure it has been working on this Committee to prepare the Australia as an Information Society : Grasping New Paradigms report which has now been presented. It was pleasurable to work with the Chairman, the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones), with the Committee secretariat, who provided us with invaluable assistance, and with representatives of all the political parties of this House in a very amicable and stimulating environment, and I thank all concerned for that.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I think the report will prove to be a very useful contribution to the discussion about Australia as an information society and the role of information-related industries in the development of Australia for the future. I shall confine my remarks today to two areas, one concerning information as a social form and its role in our development, and the other relating to the industry of information and information technologies, which is a slightly different concept.
       </para>
       <para>
        First, let us consider national information policy. National information policy and national industry and economic policy are, should be and will in the future be closely linked. In a global economy in which the traditional barriers to trade and intercourse are becoming obsolete it is essential that an industry strategy has access to information about the size and location of different markets and their changing size; assessments of consumer feedback, scientific and technological innovations as they occur, wherever in the globe; changes in style, fashion and design skills; and the implication of economic, social, environmental and political factors as they impact on our role in the world economy.
       </para>
       <para>
        If we do not have this information on a real-time, instant basis, or as close to that as we can get, our industry will always be located in a country far from the major centres of commerce and unable to compete because of its lags in information. So if Australia is to respond to the changing patterns of world trade and to overcome what has been a recent decline in its share of tradeable goods and other services, we must have an information component to our industry development over the next generation. We must recognise that this new paradigm, as we have chosen to call it in the Grasping New Paradigms title, is an important component of our national economic development.
       </para>
       <para>
        Information technology is an essential element in the processing of information transactions, but information also has sociological aspects, and I would like to make a few remarks about that in relation to the report before I go on to information as an industry. As we consider national information policy, there are some domestic ramifications of an information society that we suggest need to be taken account of. These include the disparity that we believe is growing between the information rich and the information poor within our society, with significant class, regional and ethnic implications. We have suggested mechanisms whereby this can be alleviated since it would retard our sociological and economic development to have a growing information-poor segment of our society.
       </para>
       <para>
        We should also consider whether information should be regarded as a free good or whether people should pay for it and, if so, at what rate and in what way. We should further examine the configuration of information systems and their importance for the political process whereby people having access to information will be significantly advantaged as against those who do not within the configuration of political power in our society. We also need to examine the economic significance of information and its synergy, as we call it, with other sectors of the economy and the areas where it differs from other commodities or resources.
       </para>
       <para>
        Finally, we believe we need to look at the integrity of information systems and the balance between the protection of individual privacy-a very important issue in our time-and the provision of public access to information. The borderline between these two important principles is not always clearly delineated, and we have given some instances of the way in which this might be approached in the report.
       </para>
       <para>
        I turn now to information technology and information as an industry. Information policy and industry policy will need to be increasingly integrated, as I have already said, because information has implications for the manufacturing, services and trade sectors of our economy, and it will need specialised attention in relevant government departments, including Industry, Technology and Commerce, Primary Industries and Energy, and Foreign Affairs and Trade. We believe that Ministers responsible for making statements on policies relating to these other areas should ensure that information-related aspects are specifically raised for discussion and for public information. Information in this sense means not only current data on developing trends but also storage and databanks containing past information and accessibility to them.
       </para>
       <para>
        Australia's skills, research capacity and the English language base we have inherited should be used, we believe, to develop information-related industries using sophisticated investigative techniques to identify specific market needs in, for example, advancing areas of biotechnology, pharmaceutical, communications technology, engineering and manufacturing, banking and other services. We believe that we should have and should seek to develop a significant edge in the newer industries of environmental improvement and protection where as a country we have contributions to make to the world economy.
       </para>
       <para>
        In this respect, the Commonwealth Government should encourage industry to become active users of information and of information technology and research institutions and to develop databases, recognising that many of our businesses often lose their comparative advantage by disregarding existing resources and importing know-how that may exist already in Australia. Because of the major role of the Commonwealth Government as a consumer of information technology, we believe that its departments generally should seek to adopt best-practice procedures in the synergistic use of data networks in order to maximise the return on high levels of investment and information resources, which are often not effectively used.
       </para>
       <para>
        Finally, I make a point about the balance of payments effects of information technologies. Speaking very broadly, there is a current account deficit, which we might identify as being between $7 billion and $10 billion a year, in the information technology sector. We believe that this is unfortunate and results from a number of historic procedures which cannot now be quickly corrected.
       </para>
       <para>
        We believe that the Commonwealth Government, as a major utiliser of information technologies and as a purchaser of them, can use both its purchasing policies and its internal practices to try to develop a domestic production area of information technologies to try to offset what is a large and, we believe, might well be a growing current account deficit component of between $7 billion and $10 billion. This would involve using more of our partnership for development processes, our procurement policies, and our development strategies in our institutes of higher learning and other research institutes in order to encourage domestic production.
       </para>
       <para>
        We believe the following two things to be self-evident. On the one hand, it is desperately important that this society keeps up to best practice technology in the area of information technology in order to keep our industrial and intellectual base abreast of the best in the world. On the other hand, at present we are having to import far too much of that technology and we can utilise domestic resources to develop and produce. In this respect, IBM Australia Ltd has set a lead. I commend IBM for its domestic production and, indeed, its export oriented development. More of this should be undertaken.
       </para>
       <para>
        In this respect, I would be remiss if I did not mention our aspirations with respect to the Adelaide multifunction polis project, which the Commonwealth Government presently has under consideration for major funding. It would be an ideal place at which to see a leap off in the development of information technologies researched, developed and produced in Australia for Australia as an information technology society for the twenty-first century.

         â€”I rise to speak on this motion with a great deal of pleasure. I start by indicating my great delight in having the opportunity of serving on the House of Representatives Standing Committee for Long Term Strategies, under the chairmanship of the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones). I pay public tribute to the leadership and the inspiration that he provided to the Committee and, above all, to his incredible enthusiasm for all things affecting Australia and, indeed, the world. I count myself as fortunate to serve with him in this Parliament and on that Committee.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The honourable member for Adelaide (Dr Catley) mentioned the degree of harmony on that Committee, with members of all political parties working together. It is probably worth while to put on record that the committee system in the Parliament of Australia works in an extraordinarily bipartisan fashion. I speak as a member of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and other committees, and as a member of a number of joint and standing committees over the years that I have been here. Without exception, there has been total cooperation and total harmony. Most of the people of Australia who judge the way Parliament acts and behaves by Question Time would be quite startled to see and to learn just how much bipartisan cooperation there is for the benefit of Australia and, indeed, for the world.
       </para>
       <para>
        If we speak of the world, we have to realise that Australia is part of the great global economy. In the past we have tended to try to live in isolation. One and a half centuries ago we had no option but to live in isolation because the length of time taken by a ship to come from England was months. It was only last century that the cables went in which allowed telegraphic transfer of information from the United States to Europe, ultimately to Australia and, of course, the overland telegraph went in across the centre of Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is all to do with information. Yet we have changed because, historically, the scope of information was very limited in terms of space and time and the subject. But not these days; these days we live in a society where each and every one of us is flooded by information. Yet, there are still some people who are information poor, who have no access, or have very limited access, to information which could have a major impact on their lives.
       </para>
       <para>
        We in Australia now face a challenge: we have to operate in real time with a great many variables, far more decisions have to be made and there is a great range of consequences. We risk failure or success, depending on how we treat the information that we get.
       </para>
       <para>
        Our global economy is information based. The impact of major technological innovations will continue to have a major impact on Australia and the rest of the world. If we look objectively at the way Australia has tackled its role as an information society, I suppose it is fair to say that we have been caught with our pants down. We are really not prepared, as yet, to move into the twenty-first century. That is why I welcome the report of the Committee and the challenging, far-reaching implications that its conclusions and recommendations have for the rest of Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        I also note that the honourable member for Cook (Mr Dobie) asked the rhetorical question, `Do we want to respond, as a nation, to the challenge of information?'. The answer, of course, is that we have no choice.
       </para>
       <para>
        The increases in the volume of available information, much of it based on computerised technology, have accompanied substantial changes in the structure of the Australian economy and our society. We have fallen behind other advanced nations in failing to use the intelligence and the knowledge that we have available to us. Mention has been made in this debate of the catchcry of having Australia as the clever country. We have the brains, but we have to use them. There is an urgent need for Australia to recognise that information is the central organising principle, it is a tool for understanding, and it is a vital element in trade expansion.
       </para>
       <para>
        The point that about 40 per cent of the Australian work force is involved in information has already been made. Many of those people who are involved in the information economy probably do not even know that they are part of it. The various areas of collecting, interpreting and transferring information include scientists, accountants, mathematicians, librarians and the clergy. We have the transmission or the dissemination of information and ideas, the techniques and the aesthetic experience, with teachers, actors, painters, musicians and writers. We have recording and publishing, with photographers, printers, designers and lighting technicians as part of the information economy. Real estate agents and travel agents are also part of this broad area. We have the conceptualisation of ideas with architects, town planners and philosophers as part of the information society as well.
       </para>
       <para>
        When we proceed further we have to consider what will happen with the right to know. Information is a resource, it is a critical factor in production, economic growth and development of tradeable services. As has been said, information workers, broadly defined, constitute the largest single employment sector in Australia and other advanced economies. But the growing inequity in information transfer threatens the position of individuals relative to governments and corporations; and an increasing volume of information, due to new methods of gathering, storing and dissemination, can equally lead to a fragmentation of knowledge.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is a risk that power will move away from representative institutions such as this Parliament. I believe that there can be a major threat to privacy from personal data files in private hands, especially with the prevalence of computer based technology and data matching. This is part of the information explosion and part of our information society that we have to be cautious in dealing with. The report puts forward a great many recommendations for the Commonwealth to undertake. We believe that there should be consistency in national-State information relationships, in the achievement of social justice objectives through the accessibility of information and in the outlining of the advantages of pursuing relationships between information services, the information technology industry, and the economy.
       </para>
       <para>
        I would also like to look at future growth industries for Australia. We are in the 1990s; we are about to embark on and launch ourselves into the twenty-first century. We should be aware of industries where Australia does have a competitive advantage and we should set out to use that. There are three existing areas where we have a competitive advantage. One is in agriculture, and as time goes by, as we move into the next century, in spite of the problems being confronted by rural industry now, I believe there will be a strong commodity demand throughout the world for agricultural products and there will be major wealth creation opportunities in product innovation and marketing and in the development of branding and, particularly, in agricultural biotechnology.
       </para>
       <para>
        Mining will be a continued value base for Australia. We have to add value to it with mineral processing. Tourism will grow, in spite of the body blow to it of the pilots strike, but there will be a period of consolidation and there will be strong growth in the 1990s, and information is vital to the growth of tourism. We should look at the next generation of core industries which will be of value to Australia. These are the knowledge industries, the information intensive industries-media and entertainment, education, health. I can see the opportunity for major exports for Australia in the health field and in education.

         â€”I would like to join with previous speakers in indicating the enjoyment I received from working in the Standing Committee for Long Term Strategies. I would like to pay particular tribute to the Chairman, the honourable member for Lalor (Mr Barry Jones), and to our support staff, Mr Dundas and his team. I joined the Committee only in November of last year when this inquiry had just commenced, so I come to it perhaps from a slightly different perspective.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I confess that during this inquiry many of us were uncertain as to where we would end up. Differentiating between information, data, knowledge and understanding was in itself a fairly perplexing task because for the first time we were starting to recognise that the incremental growth in data was in fact posing problems which we had tended to avoid and tended not to come to terms with. The fact is historically that different segments of our community have had information which related to them. Engineers had their information store; literary people had their information store; scientists in particular fields, physics and chemistry, had their information stores. In fact, while some had similar methodology, their information stores were very different.
       </para>
       <para>
        I can recall having a vision years ago of hell being where each different profession would live in a different suburb and speak a different language. We have seen that develop over recent years where the jargon, the terminology and the methodology of communication within subgroups or sections of our community are becoming so narrow that cross-communication is in fact declining. Of course, one has seen over the centuries a growth of accountants, of lawyers, of people specialising in specialised information who act essentially as brokers between that information and the community at large. In that context we are looking at a community now which has between one and one and a half million people who are functionally illiterate, and then we can look at the complexity of information accessing in a modern society where the level of functional illiteracy in terms of data accessing would be three to four times that figure, and growing rapidly.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Committee report, therefore, is an attempt to bring together both the issues and the possible areas or directions of solution. The report does not pretend to have solved the problem of an information policy, but rather to have defined and delineated where that solution will lie. In that context it is an extremely important report. In considering that, I wish to refer to terminology the Chairman used on a fairly regular basis-the word `stakeholders'. The Committee process in itself in some ways may eventually be the more valuable part of this inquiry. The fact is that, during the hearings, submissions and discussions took place among various stakeholders in the information society. They were putting forward their interpretations, their understandings, their problems and their projections in a sense which meant they were exchanging. So perhaps in a very unusual way the various people who will affect, impact or develop an information policy into the future were forced to confront each other during this process. That confrontation in one sense was a hostility, but in another sense was coming to terms and recognising that the various stakeholders in the information business needed to better understand what their roles were.
       </para>
       <para>
        One of the major stakeholders is the Government itself and the bureaucracy and the departments, and any one of us in Parliament is fairly aware at times of the lack of communication in the transfer of information not just between department and department but, in many cases, between sections of departments and other sections. So every day we virtually experience the fact that those various stakeholders have serviced and looked after to some degree their own area of interest. As I said, in the process of the inquiry the various stakeholders had to come to terms with each other's existence.
       </para>
       <para>
        There are substantial implications in this report and in the areas it was probing. The previous speakers have referred to particular ones. I wish particularly to touch upon the alienation aspect of what has been developing over the last 30 to 40 years with the growth in information and the increased complexity of accessing and understanding. The fact is that the sense of belonging to a community and to a society, which most of us would expect and hope that our community shares and feels, is very much affected by the sense of equality which in turn is affected by the sense of access to information.
       </para>
       <para>
        If people do not understand the system, do not understand the rules or laws or various other aspects, it is very hard for them to feel they are accepted as full and equal members of the community. During the course of the inquiry various people put forward to us ways of addressing the concept of information brokers, halfway houses of people specialising in making sure that members of the public and the community at large felt able to access and to understand the information available to them. Whether that information relates to the methodology of the pension system, to the content of the food people buy, to some particular technical problem they have with their car or with some other aspect of their physical existence in some ways is secondary, but certainly there is an increasing acceptance that more and more people in our community are feeling a sense of isolation and alienation from the community as a whole. That in turn produces anxiety, uncertainty and, in many cases, extreme hostility.
       </para>
       <para>
        I want to touch on some aspects of the report fairly quickly. One that I feel particularly strongly about is the question of intellectual property. This country has a long history of having innovative community people. Our patenting and our research have always been of a very high standard. Our capacity to take those ideas into some other form of development has not been as effective.
       </para>
       <para>
        Paragraph 4.40 of the report raises the question of patent protection. This is one of the areas where governments of countries the size of Australia will have to recognise that, in an increasingly competitive and globalised world with a globalised economy, the capacity of an individual or a small company in Australia to protect himself or itself from patent marauders is virtually zero. The concept of the Australian Government saying to people who register patents in Australia that it will assist in protecting those patents in world markets is one of the areas in which we have failed so badly.
       </para>
       <para>
        Another aspect that concerns me greatly is the question of sovereignty. We have seen a redefinition of information, we are seeing a redefinition of privacy and I think we are seeing a redefinition of sovereignty. With the global economy as it is developing and the ownership of information in some ways becoming increasingly restricted to a smaller number of larger organisations and larger governments, the potential for smaller countries to increasingly lose sovereignty in the world scene and in the global economy must disturb us. The Australian Government must therefore be active in ensuring that we keep access to world databases and world information.
       </para>
       <para>
        The other aspects that Australia needs to develop more in terms of its industry development obviously relate to intellectual capacity, design skills and intellectual property rights. The report points to the direction in which Australia has to be moving. I hope this report does receive serious consideration not just from government but from departments and from the community at large as well. It is a valuable document that can show us how we can improve in the future. I commend it to the House.

         â€”in reply-I welcome the opportunity to resume my remarks on the report of the Standing Committee for Long Term Strategies following its tabling on 6 June 1991. I am very grateful for the kind remarks made my colleagues on the Committee, who worked very hard. The Committee decided on balance to have a short report which covered a wide variety of issues which needed to be taken up, rather than producing a report of such length and complexity that people were deterred from reading and acting on it. Even the glossary section raises problems; each term is capable of considerable expansion, and the Committee could not have included every unfamiliar word in the report.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Before taking the House through the proposed national information policies, I should begin by emphasising the problem of fragmentation, which is particularly significant in this area. The great majority of the submissions concentrated on a single theme-the theme closest to the interest of the stakeholder making the submission. Library groups made submissions only about libraries; archivists about archives; Telecom Australia about telecommunications systems alone, not content; the Department of Defence about defence concerns, and so on.
       </para>
       <para>
        The failure to see information in a broad context is a serious problem in itself. The Committee believed that there should be far more coordination of Australia's information capacity. We argued that Australia was an information society already but a passive one in which resources have not been used effectively. We do the expensive part of collecting information and importing expensive information equipment, but we do relatively little with it.
       </para>
       <para>
        David Sless of the Communication Research Institute of Australia pointed out to the Committee:
       </para>
       <para>
        The world economy and social fabric is dependent on information, perhaps always has been. But the widespread adoption of information technologies (IT) has made this dependence more visible. It does not, however, follow that IT has enormous power to improve productive capacity and enhance the quality of our lives. The report fails to mention-
       </para>
       <para>
        this is only a partly valid criticism-
       </para>
       <para>
        that despite the massive investment in IT, no evidence of productivity improvements has been found. As The Economist recently observed:
       </para>
       <para>
        The average output of an American information worker has not budged since the early 1960s-despite huge growth in both the number of information workers and the average technology investment sitting on each one's desk.
       </para>
       <para>
        Computers have so far failed to boost productivity even on the most generous measure, output per worker. Including capital costs, as any truly accurate measure should, would make the picture look even worse. (The Economist p 13, June 16 1990).
       </para>
       <para>
        That is substantially true. We have made the point over and over that we have not turned Australia into an active information society. The problems of effective linkage are extremely serious. The Committee, however, has not recommended the creation of a single ministry with responsibility for information, a concept which would inevitably revive memories of the late Dr Goebbels. In paragraph 4.8 we said:
       </para>
       <para>
        Many Ministers, in Commonwealth and State governments, take responsibility for some aspects of information policy. Strong claims for exclusive territoriality are asserted by powerful Departments. The National Information Policy recognises the inevitable diversity of interest and does not propose that all information activities of government be placed in the hands of a single Minister. Nevertheless, information related issues-in a broad context, rather than a set of fragmented contexts-ought to be placed on the national political agenda, not only debated but understood in Cabinet, Parliament, Premiers' Conferences, the media and the community generally, with far more information flow about information flow, so that neglected areas, such as a national policy on libraries, can be recognised and addressed.
       </para>
       <para>
        Paragraph 4.24 of the report states:
       </para>
       <para>
        A national advisory body on information policy should be established by the Australian Government with appropriate representation from state governments, business and industry, research organisations and information providers, to keep broad information issues under review and provide expert advice to governments and organisations as required on information matters. This body should be serviced by a permanent interdepartmental Committee and should report to the Parliament through a Minister designated by the Prime Minister.
       </para>
       <para>
        Following on from what was said by the honourable member for Newcastle (Mr Allan Morris), in paragraph 4.39 we said:
       </para>
       <para>
        The Prime Minister should designate an appropriate Minister to take responsibility for developing laws on intellectual property given that the ownership, control and economic exploitation of information internationally will be increasingly important to the Australian economy.
       </para>
       <para>
        Historically, Australia's response to information technology has been very slow and marked by many lost opportunities-witness our failure to take up early expertise in computers, transistors, photocopying, flight recorders and Interscan. We had an early capacity which we simply threw away. If we are to leapfrog into twenty-first century industries we cannot afford to repeat these mistakes.
       </para>
       <para>
        The national information policy chapter begins with a quotation from James Madison, who, with his characteristic prescience, raised important issues about information in 1822 when he said:
       </para>
       <para>
        A popular Government, without popular information, or the means of acquiring it, is but a prologue to a farce or a tragedy, or perhaps both. Knowledge will forever govern ignorance and a people who mean to be their own governors must arm themselves with the power knowledge gives.
       </para>
       <para>
        There are 21 elements in the national information policy, each of which could be the basis of an independent report. But we thought it was essential to get these issues on the national political agenda urgently.
       </para>
       <para>
        I will run through the headings: `The Right to Know', `Industry', `Scientific and Technological Information (STI)', `Intellectual Property Law', `Transborder Data Flows', `Sovereignty', `Defence', `Telecommunications/Media', `Media Ownership and Control'-something that we tend only to deal with when a crisis comes up that we are trying to manage crisis-`Libraries', `Archives', `Public Accounting Information', `Social Justice', `Privacy', `Education', `Information Research', `Information Statistics', `Promoting Efficient/Effective Information Use', `Promoting Critical Evaluation of Information', `Consumer Information' and `Copyright'.
       </para>
       <para>
        Among the most serious of these issues is that of sovereignty, which was mentioned by the honourable member for Newcastle. I point to paragraph 4.45:
       </para>
       <para>
        A particular risk for Australia is that the nations which generate the greatest scientific activity-Japan, Germany, the U.S., Britain, France, Italy, Sweden, Switzerland-may demand reciprocity in information exchange. They will not provide quality information to us, unless we provide quality information to them. There is also some evidence that some nations will only pass on STI-
       </para>
       <para>
        that is, scientific and technological information-
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . on the basis that we have laws which restrict access in a way comparable to the nation originating the information. However, Australia cannot take the option of a retreat into defensive isolation-in the end it would protect nothing.
       </para>
       <para>
        Australia is facing a new situation. We were used to the idea that people working in universities were able to contribute absolutely freely to the flow of information internationally. As we said in paragraph 4.44:
       </para>
       <para>
        Science is an international activity operating in the long term and it knows no regional boundaries, while technology is national, extremely competitive, emphasising short term elements. A middle sized economy such as Australia may lose its best scientists to nations with higher levels of activity, while industry may become uncompetitive and suboptimal.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Committee was also particularly struck by the very valuable evidence given to it by the Privacy Commissioner, Mr Kevin O'Connor. He made the point that is cited at paragraph 4.74:
       </para>
       <para>
        The introduction of new technologies will bring new problems to the ones that already exist in the area of privacy. Over the last decade, privacy problems associated with new developments in technology . . . have grown.
       </para>
       <para>
        He argued that the increased use of artificial intelligence and automatic data handling will pose threats to privacy because the exercise of human judgment will be eliminated or of declining relevance in deciding which information will be passed on and which will not. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

        <para in-line="1">
         â€”I would like to speak to the report of the Standing Committee on Procedure dealing with a citizen's right of reply; that is, the right of someone who has been named within Parliament to have the capacity within the parliamentary framework to reply to matters raised concerning him. It is important to address the balance between the two ends of the spectrum: the question of parliamentary privilege, which is fundamental to members of parliament, and the rights of individual citizens of this country to be treated fairly and equally, both within the public domain and, obviously, by the law.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        We are testing here the capacity of the House of Representatives to assess whether there ought to be a right of reply. The Procedure Committee has determined that there is a case to be made for that on the basis of experience in the Senate. However, I should make some points that are germane to the matter before the House. It is important that we do not assume that by setting up a mechanism for giving a citizen the right of reply within the Parliament we automatically overcome the difficulties that may arise here. It is my strongly held view that we will overcome the problems within the Parliament only if members of parliament take upon themselves the responsibility to behave in a way that does not both lower the reputation of the Parliament and damage individuals. As members of parliament we have a very strong responsibility to conduct ourselves in such a way that ideally this process would not be needed.
       </para>
       <para>
        Of course, that is an ideal circumstance and we can only set that up as a model towards which we would operate. The reality is that at times people claim to have been aggrieved by what has happened within the parliamentary chamber. That is the essence of what I am talking about, but I return to this: if we take the view of the Australian public generally, it can be summed up in three elements. Firstly, the public believes that conduct within the Parliament itself needs to be improved; secondly, they believe that language in the Parliament needs to be improved; and, thirdly, members of parliament are often seen to act in a way in which members of the public would not be able to act. In essence, they are the three elements in the way the public regards Parliament.
       </para>
       <para>
        The media plays a part in this too, because the media has a tendency to focus largely upon the thorns rather than upon the roses. The conduct of Parliament is in general very well managed and members of parliament display great quality in their behaviour within the Parliament. In essence, the public is presented with an image of Parliament that is somewhat astray from the reality of the performance here. Nevertheless, that does not mean that the public is wrong in its view. In my view, the public is right to ask that parliamentary standards be higher, that language in Parliament be improved, and that we in Parliament are seen to be dealing directly with the problems of the community on a day to day basis. I think that is a reasonable assumption to be made by the people in the community, and it is something that members of parliament need to be aware of. The abuse of the parliamentary system is certainly germane to the issue of conduct.
       </para>
       <para>
        Therefore let me focus this: if we were to try to assess whether people have a right to come before Parliament to rebut a particular claim made about them, the first observation might be that one would give way to a whole rash of applications for people to appear before the Parliament to correct such claims. In relation to the Senate procedure, 11 instances of the right of reply being exercised have occurred over the three years in which the procedure has been available in the Senate. According to the Committee report, it has worked well:
       </para>
       <para>
        Significantly, it has not been seen to diminish the ability of Senators to raise matters of importance to them and has been accepted well by Senators.
       </para>
       <para>
        Clearly within the conduct of the Senate itself the right of reply has worked well from our point of view. However, I think it needs to be seen that in some respects the House of Representatives is more a political chamber and tends to have a sharper edge to its conduct than does the Senate, and in many respects we cannot automatically draw upon the experience in the Senate and apply it here. There is the capacity for the cutting edge of the House of Representatives to be a bit sharper, and we may well find that we could end up with a number of controversies being worked out within this place, with citizens coming in to seek a right of reply. It therefore comes down to the fact that if we are to have a mechanism it needs to be clearly set out and to deal with some elements.
       </para>
       <para>
        It seems to me that the Committee is quite correct in picking up those points. The report states:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . the Committee envisaged the following broad guidelines:
       </para>
       <para>
        - That the procedure only be available to `natural persons', ie, to individuals and not corporate bodies.
       </para>
       <para>
        So if a corporate body were in some way mentioned in this place-and honourable members can think of many corporate bodies that have covered themselves in less than glory in recent years-it would not have a right of reply to come here, and neither should it. The report continues:
       </para>
       <para>
        - That the procedures relate only to statements made in the House, and be available only in cases where the statements can reasonably be considered actionable in a court of law.
       </para>
       <para>
        In other words, they would have some defamatory element. I think it is important that that have a clearer boundary. It goes on:
       </para>
       <para>
        - That the parliamentary body administering the procedure should not be called upon to be a judge and jury on the matter.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is, the Parliament itself has the capacity to deal with the matter. I think we have to say this again: if the Parliament is working properly, it should be the forum in which people can raise issues and have them debated. In fact, private members' business on Thursday provides that opportunity, as do many other elements in this place. It is important to note that the Parliament already has the capacity to deal with this, and in fact if someone does claim to have been aggrieved it is possible for him or her to petition another member of parliament to rectify what may be regarded as a wrong statement or a wrongdoing. The final point states:
       </para>
       <para>
        That the rules covering the content of replies be similar to those for a Member making a personal explanation, ie, that they be succinct and strictly relevant to the issue.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is very important. We cannot have a situation where the community at large is engaged in second guessing what goes on in the Parliament. If the Parliament were to be accountable in that sense one could imagine a situation where people in the community and the media could arrange to have an extension of debate in the Parliament about a matter which had already been properly considered and debated there. We could end up with a secondary debating procedure going on. That would be totally unsatisfactory because the Parliament itself is meant to be the framework and the forum within which these matters are brought to a conclusion and not within which matters have a further extension.
       </para>
       <para>
        I think one of the great difficulties we have faced in recent times has been the loss of the authority of the parliamentary system. That, for me, is a very significant element. One of the things which we really must hold dear to our hearts is the authority of the parliamentary system.

         â€”I thank the honourable member. It should be seen to work without hindrance and it should be seen to act in a way which does not deprecate itself and its own standing and-I go back to my earlier remarks about language, behaviour and conduct. I think one of the sad things is that in this country the number of parliaments we have-State houses, upper houses and lower houses-means that we are massively over-governed. As a consequence, we have pulled too many members of parliament from too small a pool of people and the quality has dropped off. We have a long batting tail in Australia in the various parliaments. Therefore, it often happens that something which occurs within a State parliament is, quite wrongly, ascribed to members of the House of Representatives. So we are all branded and, as a consequence, the whole parliamentary system suffers. The answer is, of course, to have fewer members of parliament and, I suppose in some senses, fewer chambers.

        But that is not what this report is about. I think that the recommendations of the Committee are sensible.

         â€”I come to this debate not as a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee of Privileges and not as one who has turned his mind to the detailed recommendations or whether they should be supported by amendments to the Standing Orders at this time. But the Committee has brought forward particularly interesting proposals and I think it should be commended for them.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The previous speaker, the honourable member for Stirling (Mr Ronald Edwards), made the point that the standard of conduct in this Parliament is the subject of very considerable interest and comment. Our reputation at some times is high and at other times is quite low. This has been a matter of concern to the Opposition. The procedures of the Parliament ought to be such as to enable sound and sensible contributions by members of parliament about a whole range of issues which affect people's daily lives. There are a whole host of procedures which cover issues such as when matters can be raised concerning individuals in debate or at Question Time. During Question Time it is not always the case that allegations can be made by reflecting upon people individually-the Standing Orders largely preclude that. There are also some limitations in debate. But often the privileges of the Parliament can be availed of to allow honourable members to mention people by name and thereby put such people in a position where they feel that their reputation has been affected. Of course, other relief that is normally available to people in such circumstances-particularly access to the courts-is limited.
       </para>
       <para>
        One has to look at the privilege we have-the privilege of protection. It has to be exercised responsibly by members of parliament. I recall that in my 17 years in the Parliament there is only one occasion upon which I have actually taken up this privilege and named a person in circumstances where the person believed that it reflected upon his reputation. He said in relation to the comments I had made that he would seek redress. He never did. It was a situation in which the individual had been named on a significant number of occasions in reports by consumer affairs bodies. I felt that due to the fact that he had been named adversely in those reports, the fact that his activities were leading to people losing money and that he was selling door to door in my constituency it was appropriate, I should warn my constituents that if they were approached by this individual it might well lead to them suffering loss also. It seemed to me that that was a proper exercise of the responsibility that I had as a member of parliament to the constituents in my electorate.
       </para>
       <para>
        I suppose the individual concerned could have taken issue with the consumer affairs bodies. He could have approached another member of parliament if he thought that I had raised matters incorrectly in the Parliament and these matters have been mentioned in the report. It seems to me that often the complaints that parliamentary privilege has been abused are used as a way of reflecting upon the complaints that have been raised and to imply that because it was done under parliamentary privilege those allegations ought not to be treated as having as great a degree of substance or regard by other people in the community. But that is not always the case.
       </para>
       <para>
        The other side of the coin that I can recall-it was a period of great disappointment to me in the Parliament-was the way in which some other committee reports in relation to activities involving payment of taxation and bottom of the harbour schemes, as they were referred to, were the subject of debate in the Parliament in another place. The reputations of some very substantial Australians were brought into question in debate in a way which I thought did the Parliament very little credit at all. It became obvious over time, as those matters were the subject of contest, that some of the issues ought not to have been raised.
       </para>
       <para>
        I have particularly in mind the comments in relation to Mr Reid of James Hardie Industries Ltd where, very clearly as I recall, he was carrying out duties as an executor of an estate. The matters raised were clearly matters of contest upon which very clear legal advice was available to him to the effect that what he was doing was legal and appropriate. The circumstances in which he was named and the suggestions of personal advantage to him were quite false. It seems to me that if one were looking at the procedures which are suggested in this report, such a person so aggrieved would then have the capacity to make a complaint that a matter had adversely affected his or her reputation.
       </para>
       <para>
        In my view that would clearly have been true in the case I have mentioned. Mr Reid could have requested that he be able to incorporate an appropriate response in the parliamentary record. The Speaker would then have to satisfy himself that it was not a trivial matter, that the submission was not frivolous, vexatious or offensive or that it would be inappropriate for it to be included in the record. He would also perhaps have to take some advice, as I have said, from the Committee of Privileges in certain circumstances if he thought it appropriate.
       </para>
       <para>
        That Committee could decide to consider the submission. If it considered it was not serious, frivolous, vexatious or offensive in character, it could report that to the House. If it decided the submission gave the person named particular rights, it could refer that also to the House. That would bring forward the information in a way which would assist people in appropriate circumstances to clear their reputation. These suggestions are particularly valuable. Judgments need to be made so that people whose names are raised or mentioned in debate have a substantial defence to the claims or allegations that have been made. Those matters ought to be the subject of review to ensure that the procedures suggested here are not tainted and brought into abuse themselves. Procedures are planned, it seems from the resolution, for that to occur.
       </para>
       <para>
        Those procedures as outlined seem to be a balanced approach to a very difficult problem, one by which people ought to be able to approach the Parliament and one by which others, who may not have such substantial claims, can be sorted out. So it is important that the Parliament, now having a report before it by its Standing Committee on Procedure, find time to develop appropriate standing orders and to bring the matter on for more detailed consideration. That is a matter that the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) would need to take on board and bring forward at an early date, because very valuable work has been undertaken by the Committee here. I certainly hope it is not put aside at this point so that it is for another parliament, at another time, to consider it-as often seems to be the case with these procedural matters.

         â€”I have seen the system work very well, and the honourable member for Dundas worked well under pressure. The point that needs to be made is that very often, in the community generally, there is a sense of frustration sometimes about injustice carrying the day. We can all think of circumstances within our own electorates with our own constituents where something has happened that is beyond the immediate reach of justice. Let me describe it in this way. First, it is true that the wheels of justice grind slowly and very often it takes a long time for people to get redress in matters. Secondly, it is also the case that very often people are denied access to legal solutions because those solutions are very expensive and often cannot be achieved.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Lawyers deserve great criticism in this respect. It is interesting how often it is impossible for people to have justice achieved because the lawyers simply make the asking price too high. What we see increasingly these days is a situation where-and I am sure my colleagues on both sides of the House would have this experience-people come to see us with a problem and we want to refer them to a lawyer because we have exhausted our limits as members of parliament. The person, to seek justice, has to see a lawyer, but he can then come back and say, `I am sorry, Mr Edwards. I cannot proceed with this matter any further, even though I believe wrong has been done me, because the lawyer tells me it will be $600 to talk to him and then, to follow the case through, it will probably cost $5,000 to $10,000. If I do not get costs then I am up for the lot'. If the other side appeals it is a very lengthy and expensive process. That is the common experience and, sadly, it is the case.
       </para>
       <para>
        So often the Parliament itself can be used to right what might seem to be a relatively small wrong. I had a situation which I had to bring before the Parliament. In that case the Parliament worked very well in redressing that problem. It was a case of the underpayment of wages to young people who worked as trolley boys. Many people would be familiar with them in shopping centres. In this case, instead of them being paid $5 an hour, their employer, VIP Cleaning, lowered their rate of pay to $2 an hour. The issue was raised by a parent, who was told that the trolley boys could be paid $1 an hour.
       </para>

        I brought the matter up in the Parliament. I am happy to report that, as a consequence of bringing up that matter in the Parliament, VIP Cleaning lost its contracts at a series of shopping centres because the management of those shopping centres could not in conscience deal with a subcontractor who dealt with young people in such a callous way. In that respect the Parliament worked very well. There was an injustice being done towards these young people. VIP Cleaning was exploiting their labour quite grossly. As a consequence of using the parliamentary forum, there was an element of justice performed.

        The young man who approached me is now working very productively for another employer. He has been given increased responsibilities and is now earning in excess of $5 an hour because he now has a responsible employer. In this case raising the matter in Parliament worked very well.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is important to say that the Parliament itself can function as a forum to which grievances and injustices can be brought. If we reflect on history, that was in many senses the reason why parliament was developed. Historically, the ordinary person in Britain was denied access to all those procedures by economic circumstances. In many senses, sadly, despite legal aid, that is the case today. Many people are still denied their rights at law because the lawyers make it prohibitively expensive.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is a very good case to be made for allowing lawyers to advertise and thereby get some competition in the marketplace so that people can get redress, which they cannot get very often through the legal system. People have to be either very poor or very rich. If people happen to be in the middle-most Australians-they miss out. In those circumstances, the legal system does not offer redress, assistance or comfort. What we need is a situation where people can have matters brought up.
       </para>
       <para>
        In my experience in eight years in Parliament I have seen many members of parliament bring matters before this chamber. Those matters are very often resolved satisfactorily in the eyes of the person to whom the injustice was done, and without great cost. I have certainly found that the role of parliamentary privilege, when used properly-it is used properly in most circumstances in this Parliament-affords great capacity for individual citizens to have their wrongs redressed. Obviously this is an important issue. It is for that reason that I am pleased to support the recommendation of the Committee-and have felt it necessary to do so twice.

         â€”As the Chairman of the Committee, I want to thank those honourable members who have taken part in this debate. It is important that we continue to review the Standing Orders and the procedures of the Parliament and the way in which Parliament conducts its business. The two reports are part of a series of reports, one of which established general business day for private members as an element of the parliamentary structure, which it had not been for many years prior to that report coming in. In years gone by we had to stand up on the opening day of the Parliament and put down our notices. They could come on three years later when the relevance to current events of that time could be very low.

        The right of reply, which is embodied in this report, is something which has been tried in the Senate. It is part of the evolvement of our society and our approach to government, information, the rights of government, parliaments, et cetera.
       </para>
       <para>
        Once, many things that Prime Ministers and others said went unquestioned. That is no longer the case. Most Public Service reports and such were private and not accessible. We have gone through processes of appeal tribunals against Minister's decisions and freedom of information. I think I should make the point that the proposals-if the suggested guidelines are adopted-do not allow for people to argue the merits of an argument, but basically to respond, where they have been aggrieved, in a manner which would be actionable if it were said outside the Parliament. That is not unreasonable for a person who has been aggrieved.
       </para>
       <para>
        A problem that exists in our society, and one which is almost impossible to overcome, is that matters of public importance and concern cannot be debated anywhere else but in the Parliament under privilege, because of the manner in which the courts have allowed the laws of defamation and libel to be used as a form of holding written censorship and quite often have facilitated this type of operation where there is no defamation or prospect of it. The person who seeks to raise important issues in the community is confronted with enormous legal costs and, possibly, contempt charges, because that person seeks to debate matters which are entitled to be debated in the community and because the rules of the courts, it appears, have been devised to disadvantage the community rather than to advantage it. I do not want to debate that at this stage.
       </para>
       <para>
        A number of reports of the Procedure Committee have been reported to this House and have not yet been dealt with. There is a considerable amount of work still to be done. The method by which we open the Parliament is not going to change materially; nor is the Parliament itself, the level of performance or the way in which honourable members do their jobs. I believe, if the proposals are fully adopted, that once and for all we will get rid of the pretence that the Senate is the successor to the barons of England and the King's council. It is not; it is a descendant, somewhat diluted, of the Senate of the United States. It is a directly elected House and it has nothing to do with the House of Lords.
       </para>
       <para>
        For some reason, it wishes to defend and maintain itself as some form of house of aristocracy or something of that nature. I think it is an ego trip and one that the senators could well do without in their own best interests. I believe the Senate performs functions which are far more significant than those performed in the House of Lords, and it might be time that it shed the mantle of being a house of privilege and decided to be a house of parliament instead-which is what it functions as.
       </para>
       <para>
        The other part of the report, which I have previously dealt with in some detail-and which my colleague the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Shack) dealt with on a previous occasion-is one which is on trial. Parliaments around the world have not adopted this type of procedure. It was initiated by the Senate. For that, it gets credit; if it fails, eventually, blame. But it is an initiative and one which is well worthy of trial. Obviously, if it is abused, it will have to be addressed. I think the proposals which are before us would prevent that type of abuse.
       </para>
       <para>
        The aspects of the review of the Standing Orders which my Committee is undertaking have far greater consequence to that. We can tinker at the edges and bring the Standing Orders up to date; we can recommend to the Parliament better ways of conducting Question Time and better ways of conducting our debates. They may or may not be better; it is a matter of choice. We cannot write into the Standing Orders provisions that overcome what is the real problem with Question Time-despite what people might say about it: that is, that it has long since ceased to be question time by members; it is now a structured question time in which on both sides of the House questions are prepared for political purposes and asked for political purposes. When Ministers answer in a political way, we have points of order saying, `Well, we are entitled to be political but you are not'.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is a function of the House. It is the way the House has developed. Almost every question that is asked in this place now is approved by someone outside-a Whip, probably, or someone associated with the Whip, or Ministers. It is asked in a form which is approved by the Minister or by the office of the Leader of the Opposition or his delegate. It is a function of the political process rather than honourable members rising to ask Ministers questions which Ministers are expected to answer or to obtain answers for.
       </para>
       <para>
        I remember a Minister standing up here not too many years ago and saying to an honourable member who asked a highly complex question, `You do not seriously expect that I would know the answer to that question. I will find out for the honourable member'. A good, proper and honest answer-the question did not deserve an answer unless the honourable member had given the Minister some notice. I can also remember a Liberal Minister ringing me up and saying, `Look, I have got something here. If you would like to ask me a question, it will be to your benefit and to that of your electorate'. He did not get hung for it either. But that has now changed. The pressure is on for the 30-second grab. That is the way both sides of the Parliament operate.
       </para>
       <para>
        The other problem is that parliamentary debates, apart from those one or two debates a year which are of significance, are not covered in the media. Therefore, what is said in Parliament goes virtually no further. I believe the real problem this Parliament has-and which the Procedure Committee and the Parliament itself, particularly the House of Representatives, have to face up to-is that in the last 25 years the amount of business which is conducted by the Commonwealth, the amount of responsibilities which the Commonwealth has taken unto itself, has doubled or trebled.

        In the Budget when I was first here we dealt with defence, health, social security, road funding and very little else. Today we deal with a myriad of matters. The plain fact is that we have too much legislation for the House to deal with in a proper manner. Under the present circumstances, the House sits with five or 10 members in it and drones on like a sausage machine when dealing with legislation until we get to the last three weeks, when we have a guillotine to force through 50 Bills. That is not going to change, and nothing that happens about drafting or anything else is going to change it. Whereas once this House could, and did, devote a whole month to a Bill-as in April 1947, to the Conciliation and Arbitration Bill-today it is lucky to devote an hour. The procedures of the House for dealing with Bills have to change to fit the requirements of the House. We are not going to sit longer hours; that is up to the Procedure Committee. The time allotted for this debate has just about run out. I seek leave to continue my remarks at a later time.

      <para>
       (1) notes the federal Government's promise, made in 1988 at the time of the transfer of the Defence Service Home Loans (DSHL) portfolio to the Westpac Banking Corporation, that no DSHL recipient would be financially worse off as a result of the transfer;

       (3) calls on the federal Government to honour its promise.
      </para>
      <para>
       In moving this motion I acknowledge that in the scheme of things around the country, when looking at financial disasters-in particular, in my own home State of Western Australia; or Victoria, for that matter, which is now known as the Albania of Australia-the matter I am raising today is very small beer financially. In the overall picture, when we are talking about millions of dollars, this matter represents a smaller amount of money; but, effectively, it represents a similar principle.
      </para>
      <para>
       The matter I am bringing before the House today is one that was brought to my attention by one of my constituents, Mr Jack Mews of Two Rocks in my electorate, an ex-serviceman who, together with his wife, Hestor-herself a World War II veteran-took up the defence service home loans to which they were entitled after their years of service in the Australian defence forces.
      </para>
      <para>
       We know that the purpose of the defence service home loan (DSHL) was to recognise the valuable service that the men and women of the defence forces gave to their country and to afford them a privilege that would in some way reward them for their commitment to Australia. In the interests of Mr Mews, his wife and the other 125,000 ex-service men and women in Australia-13,400 of whom are in Western Australia-who have defence service home loans, I am bringing to the attention of the House a matter of principle where the Government has failed to honour a promise it made to them in 1988.
      </para>
      <para>
       The defence service home loans scheme was a special program that was initiated by the Government in 1918. It has been upgraded very little since, but it has provided a vital form of assistance to veterans of World War I, World War II, Korea, Malaya and Vietnam; along with peacetime service personnel. Defence service home loans provide an incentive to people to serve with the defence forces and reward them for their commitment to their country. DSHLs have also been made available to compensate service and ex-service people for any detrimental effects in relation to home ownership as a result of the nature of their service to their country.
      </para>
      <para>
       In 1988, this unique portfolio was privatised and taken over by Westpac Banking Corporation under the agreement that no person eligible for a DSHL would be worse off as a result of that transfer. The Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys), said on 10 November 1988:
      </para>
      <para>
       . . . the Government promised that eligible persons and borrowers-
      </para>
      <para>
       of DSHLs-
      </para>
      <para>
       would not be disadvantaged under the new arrangements.
      </para>
      <para>
       But unfortunately, in hurrying through this significant piece of legislation, the Government failed to check whether other bank charges would be imposed on DSHL recipients as a result of the privatisation of the portfolio to Westpac. The Government, in not giving sufficient consideration to the effects of the transfer of the portfolio to Westpac, sadly let down the interests of those DSHL recipients.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Minister failed to recognise that ex-service personnel who take out DSHL face systematic State government charges, some of which have increased by up to 200 per cent in the last few years. DSHL are now subject to the increasing banking costs, such as financial institutions duty (FID) and mortgage discharge fees. The governments of Victoria, Tasmania, the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory are still levying financial institutions duty tax on DSHL accounts, the former three charging a monthly 0.06 per cent and Tasmania charging 0.025 per cent. Until June of this year, the State Government of Western Australia was charging an FID rate of 0.06 per cent on DSHLs. At November 1989, this charge was 0.02 per cent; therefore, this charge has increased by a huge 200 per cent since 1989.
      </para>
      <para>
       I would like to acknowledge the great work done by my State colleague the honourable Reg Davies, member for the north metropolitan region in the Western Australian Parliament, who put extraordinary pressure on the State Government to grant an exemption to DSHL payers from FID in Western Australia. But of course it still remains, as I said, in Victoria, Tasmania, the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory.
      </para>
      <para>
       Recipients now also face a supplementary charge on the discharge of their DSHL of $80, which, although not compulsory, was a service provided free by the Department of Veterans' Affairs before the Westpac takeover. This is a major inconvenience to those borrowers who do not wish to pay the $80 and who have to conduct the discharge procedure personally.
      </para>
      <para>
       There is also a matter of convenience. Before the 1988 transfer to Westpac, DSHL borrowers were able to make their monthly payments at 4,489 post offices or agencies Australia-wide. They are now required to make their payment at one of the approximately 1,200 national Westpac branches, agencies or service centres.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government has consistently reneged on its commitments made to the people who have served Australia in the defence forces. It has also failed to properly represent the interests of the veterans community and the interests of those who have fought for their country. Back in 1988 during the debate over the transfer of the DSHLs to Westpac, the coalition pointed out a number of deficiencies in the legislation. In the second reading speech in December 1988, Senator Jocelyn Newman, the shadow Minister for defence science and personnel, pointed out a number of concerns regarding the Defence Services Home Amendment Bill. She supported improving the legislation as follows:
      </para>
      <para>
       (i) The amount of the loan should be increased to reflect the current cost of housing;
      </para>
      <para>
       (ii) holders of loans granted prior to December 1987 should enjoy a right to portability;
      </para>
      <para>
       (iii) Defence Force personnel who enlisted since May 1985 should be included in the proposed Scheme; and
      </para>
      <para>
       (iv) a review of the Scheme should be provided for after the first 2 years operation''.
      </para>
      <para>
       Owing to pressure from the Opposition, since then the Government has in some way addressed all of these concerns, except the recommendation for review of the DSHL scheme. In 1980 under a coalition Government, the DSHL limit was increased to $25,000, and it has not since been increased. At that time this figure represented 55 per cent of the median purchase price of a home. But from 1979-80 to 1989-90, the consumer price index rose by 121.3 per cent, and the median price for an established house in Australia's six capital cities as at April 1991 was $145,000. So the $25,000 limit for a DSHL now represents only 17 per cent of the median purchase price of a home.
      </para>
      <para>
       In May of this year the Government finally made available a new loan portfolio that will enable those service personnel who enlisted after May 1985 and under previous legislation were not entitled to DSHL benefits to access a home loan of up to $40,000. This scheme, to be implemented by the National Bank and the Defence Service Housing Authority, will also be available to eligible DSHL recipients who would be prepared to forgo their DSHL entitlement.
      </para>
      <para>
       The scheme finally addresses the issue of portability, provision for which under 1988 legislation was only allowed for those ex-service personnel who took up their DSHL after 1987. The new legislation in the form of the Defence Force (Home Loans Assistance) Act 1991 allows for two eligible members of the defence forces who are married to add their loans together and take, in effect, a loan of up to $80,000 with the assistance provided for under the scheme. Under the previous scheme, both married partners are not able to take their entitlement for the same home. My constituent and his wife, Mr Jack and Mrs Hestor Mews, were recently involved in proceedings regarding this anomaly which allows recipients in de facto relationships to access individual DSHLs but entitles married couples to only one DSHL for their home.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Defence Force (Home Loans Assistance) Bill 1990, however, failed to recognise the legitimate entitlements of those men and women who had been enlisted in the defence forces for less than 12 months and who had been involved in active service in the Gulf war. It was only after the Opposition pointed out this anomaly that the Minister for Veterans' Affairs announced in this May of this year that it would be removed.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government's misrepresentation to the ex-service community is becoming all too familiar. The Government's latest failure to honour its commitment made to the veterans community involves the integration of repatriation general hospitals into the State health systems. In August 1988 the Federal Government announced that it would be seeking to transfer all repatriation general hospitals to the respective State health systems by July 1995. However, the Returned Services League, as well as other major ex-service organisations such as the Australian Veterans and Defence Service Council, the Regular Defence Force Welfare Association and the Vietnam Veterans Association of Australia, has indicated that issues such as priority of access for veterans and war widows to hospital care post-integration and the quality of such care are yet to be satisfactorily resolved.
      </para>
      <para>
       In summing up, the Government in transferring the DSHL portfolio to Westpac in 1988 failed to honour its commitment to those people of Australia who had served Australia and deserved entitlements that reflected the value of that service to their country. The Government reneged on its commitment that no-one would be disadvantaged as a result of the transfer to Westpac, and people with DSHLs are faced with systematic increases in government charges, such as the FID tax, which has increased, in the case of Western Australia prior to its exemption, by up to 200 per cent. The Government, as shown, has not adequately represented the interests of the ex-service community on a number of issues, the most recent being the integration of repatriation general hospitals into the State health systems of Australia.

        â€”I cannot say I am surprised that this motion has come before the House. My electorate of Fowler encompasses a very large ex-service and defence population, and there is not much that has been said amongst the ex-services committee that I am not aware of. I am the first to admit that there is a belief amongst sections of the ex-services committee that the transfer of the defence service home loans (DSHLs) portfolio to Westpac has been detrimental to their financial welfare. There is also a belief, as outlined by the motion of the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing), that the Government has broken an undertaking to the defence service home loan recipients and that they are disadvantaged as a result of the transfer.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       What has happened, of course, is that people have latched onto the existence of State financial institutions duty (FID), bank account debits tax and Westpac charges for discharges of mortgages as evidence of the claim that the recipients are worse off. The fact is that such a claim, as understandable as it is in the circumstances, is simply not true. The real situation is that the vast majority of DSHL recipients are better off under the Westpac arrangements-although to appreciate this point it is necessary to look at the history of the scheme.
      </para>
      <para>
       As pointed out by the honourable member for Moore, the scheme was initially introduced by the Defence Service Homes Act in 1918. As time went on, the scheme was expanded by increases in the amount of the loan and the recognition of peacetime service. In 1973 a loan of $12,000 was available over a period of 45 years. In 1974 that was increased to $15,000 and the term reduced to 32 years. On 15 October 1980 the loan was increased to $25,000 and the term altered to 25 years. The fact is, however, that under the old arrangements prospective borrowers were required to wait some 10 months for the loan funds. The borrower, therefore, incurred the costs of bridging finance.
      </para>
      <para>
       Further, a defence service home loan could generally be granted only once, effectively meaning that a borrower's entitlement to a loan was confined to the house for which the loan was granted. The loan balance could not be transferred to another home. This severely limited the financial options available to the borrower. If the house was sold, the loan had to be repaid and the DSHL benefit was lost. Only in exceptional circumstances could second assistance be granted.
      </para>
      <para>
       It must also be remembered, of course, that prior to the sale of the loans portfolio to Westpac, the capital for such loans was met by the Federal Government. Under the current arrangements with Westpac, the capital component of the loans is funded by the bank. The Government pays the bank an interest subsidy to ensure that the interest rate charged to the DSHL borrower remains fixed for the duration of the loan.
      </para>
      <para>
       Various governments explored options for improving this scheme. However, the options were limited by the resources available to fund the scheme. Availability of funds for new loans under the scheme depended to some extent on discharge of mortgages. In 1985 the Government decided to overcome the funding constraints by selling the entire loans portfolio, while at the same time preserving as far as possible the benefits that existed. The Government gave an undertaking that no DSHL client would be financially worse off as a result of the sale. The Government guaranteed that there would be no increase in the monthly repayments or in the interest rates charged on DSH loans that existed at the time of the sale to Westpac. This undertaking was given in the context of the overall improvements and benefits under the scheme.
      </para>
      <para>
       Although borrowers are required to meet bank charges and State financial institutions duty charges, as the honourable member for Moore pointed out, the Government's commitment to preserving the benefits of fixed repayments and interest rates for the duration of the loan remains, and that is of course the most important component.
      </para>
      <para>
       The representative bodies of the service and ex-service communities, particularly the Returned Services League, were fully consulted by the Government and agreed-I stress `agreed'-that DSHL borrowers should pay normal commercial fees, including FID. The fact is that the totality of benefits available under the scheme now far outweigh the small imposts involved in the FID and certain other charges. The rate of FID is extremely small, ranging from 2.5c per $100 to 6c per $100. The normal monthly repayment on a $25,000 loan is $175, and that could not be considered extravagant by any means. As is evident from those figures, we are talking of a yearly charge of between 60c and $1. In all honesty, that is not the type of money that could be realistically presented as a case for the Government breaking a promise of no financial disadvantage.
      </para>
      <para>
       It should also be remembered that not all States in Australia levy the FID, and I refer again to the admission by the honourable member for Moore that his own State of Western Australia does not have it. On the other hand, there are specific advantages accruing to DSHL borrowers following the sale of the loans portfolio to Westpac. Firstly, the total establishment fee for DSHL borrowers who require supplementary finance is lower now than would be the case if the transfer had not taken place. DSHL customers are therefore not financially worse off as a result of the transfer of this scheme's loans to Westpac. Secondly, the majority of DSHL borrowers require supplementary finance. This is available from Westpac at first mortgage rates and for a combined establishment fee. DSHL borrowers thereby avoid establishment fees for second mortgages.
      </para>
      <para>
       Thirdly, DSHL borrowers also now avoid higher second mortgage interest rates. Fourthly, the waiting period for a defence service home loan has been eliminated, thereby avoiding costly bridging finance. By saving the 10 months involved under the old scheme, borrowers save around $2,500 at current bridging finance rates. Fifthly, the sale of the loans portfolio also permitted the introduction of portability for new loans granted after 9 December 1987. This was previously not possible when the scheme was a government-funded program, because of budgetary constraints. Portability has since been extended to all DSH loans in existence after 9 December 1987. Sixthly, interest on excess credit was increased from 3.75 per cent to an average of 6.85 per cent. I think it is fair to say that the majority of borrowers make repayments in excess of standard loan instalments, meaning that this interest increase on excess credit is a very real financial advantage flowing from the portfolio sale.
      </para>
      <para>
       On balance, I strongly believe that the savings in bridging finance costs, the availability of second mortgage finance at first mortgage interest rates, the net savings in establishment fees, higher interest rates on excess credits, together with the benefits of portability, far outweigh the costs and charges to which the honourable member for Moore referred.
      </para>
      <para>
       One last important point I must make relates to the discharge of mortgages, which has caused some angst to personal friends of mine. I refer to the fee of $140 for discharge of mortgages. Borrowers do not have to pay the $80 if they themselves register the document with the Titles Office; there is no charge. Having regard to all the facts, I do not believe it is appropriate for the House to support this motion.

        â€”I rise in support of this motion moved by the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing). I wish to add my concern at yet another broken promise by this Government, and I am pleased to hear the concern expressed by the honourable member for Fowler (Mr Grace).
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       In the 1985 May economic statement the Government announced that the loans component of the defence service home loans (DSHL) scheme was to be sold to the private sector. On 11 October 1988 the Minister for Finance announced that agreement had been reached with Westpac Banking Corporation to purchase $1.38 billion of the existing loan portfolio of the Defence Service Homes Corporation, plus a premium payment of $85m and the right to provide new loans. Under this arrangement the Government contracted with Westpac to provide a subsidised home loan to persons eligible for a defence service home loan. The interest on these home loans was to be subsidised by the Government. The net interest rate paid by an eligible person on the first $25,000 of any home loan would not exceed 6.85 per cent per annum, with the Government paying Westpac the difference between the concessional rate and the agreed market rate-that is, the rate that would have applied if the loan had been obtained directly from the Government.
      </para>
      <para>
       However, under this scheme, normal bank fees would apply, plus a once-only loan establishment fee by Westpac. For defence personnel, the most important benefit of the new arrangements was the removal of the longstanding, 10-month waiting period for a loan, but this benefit was overshadowed, overshadowed by problems with this new arrangement which this motion by the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing) highlights. In 1988, when the Government sold the loans portfolio to Westpac, it asserted that no defence service home loan recipient would be financially worse off as a result of the transfer. This has not been the case. In fact, recipients now have to pay financial institutions duty (FID), higher fees on discharge of mortgages, and other bank charges, and if those recipients happen to reside in Victoria, those in that scheme face the potential of paying an even greater increase in charges under a financially strapped State Labor government.
      </para>
      <para>
       For those servicemen who joined the Australian Defence Forces prior to 14 May 1985, a defence service subsidised home loan was available from Westpac only. The recipients had no choice but to accept those bank charges without the option of negotiating with other banks as other Australians do. They were therefore placed at a disadvantage. Those servicemen who joined after 14 May 1985 now do have the option of taking out a home loan under the Australian Defence Force (ADF) home loan assistance scheme, which is under the control of the National Australia Bank.
      </para>
      <para>
       It is important to encourage home ownership by defence personnel, important to help plan for the future, to build an asset for the future; but to date the existing schemes assisting home ownership have not significantly encouraged home ownership. Ownership among members appears to be low, with a general tendency to defer purchases until after separation from the Australian defence forces, when posting turbulence is finished and the Defence Force retirement and death benefit lump sum is available. The instability of employment for service spouses due to constant posting reduces the confidence of both the member and the lending institution to enter into a large financial commitment. We do not want to put any further impediments in their way, such as these increased charges, which will make the owning of their own home even more difficult.
      </para>
      <para>
       I support this motion and call on this Government to honour its promise that no defence service home loan recipient will be financially worse off as a result of the transfer of the DSHL scheme to the Westpac Bank.

       <para in-line="1">
        â€”I rise to speak against the motion that is before the House, whose mover, the honourable member for Moore (Mr Filing), is implying that a promise was made by the Government to defence service home loan recipients and that that promise was broken. This claim is made on the basis that DSHL recipients, because they are subject to certain bank charges, are worse off following the Government's transfer of the DSHL portfolio to the Westpac Banking Corporation. As you would be well aware, Mr Deputy Speaker, the Government gave an undertaking at the time of making this transfer that no recipient would be worse off. The fact of the matter is that defence service home loan recipients are better off as a result of changes made by this Government since 1988-something of which the two previous Opposition speakers would have become well aware of had they taken the trouble to understand the reasons for these changes, which I will presently outline.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       Prior to November 1988, any application for a defence service home loan was likely to take as long as 10 months to process, as has already been acknowledged in this debate. In such circumstances, many applicants required bridging finance during the period they awaited approval for their loan. This bridging finance was available at market rates of interest that were, during that period, usually in excess and usually considerably in excess of the 6.85 per cent that was applying to the $25,000 available under the DSHL scheme. Now that the scheme is administered by Westpac, this unnecessary waiting period has been eliminated. Loan applications are now processed within a commercially acceptable and much shorter period. This has eliminated the need for bridging finance during an intervening period and applicants are obviously substantially better off by that change alone.
      </para>
      <para>
       A further advantage that has been associated with the transfer of DSHL to Westpac is that applicants may borrow amounts in addition to the $25,000 which is available without this additional loan being treated as a separate loan. That would attract interest at first mortgage rates, it is true, but there are not the additional bank fees which would normally be associated with a second loan. Again this benefits DSHL recipients in a way which the scheme as it previously operated did not.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government has also made additional changes to the defence service home loans scheme since November 1988, changes which have further benefited recipients. In March of last year, for example, the Prime Minister announced that the Government would provide loan portability to the large number of veterans, war widows and serving members of the defence forces who held loans as at 9 December 1987, and this new flexibility, whereby loans could be transferred when the borrower sells a home in order to purchase a new one, is an obvious improvement on the scheme as it previously operated. Prior to this change, only loans taken out since 9 December 1987 were portable and special ministerial approval was necessary to obtain portability.
      </para>
      <para>
       At the same time, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) also announced that the defence service home loans were to be extended to enable more widespread use of loans for entry into retirement villages. Assistance under this scheme was previously available only when a retirement village was a strata title arrangement, and this restriction no longer applies.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government also consulted very widely with ex-servicemen organisations before it introduced the changes which I have outlined. It is therefore not at all surprising that the new scheme has been very well received by them, with the rate of applications for loans now double that which applied under the old arrangement-which is fairly indicative of how they feel about being disadvantaged by the changes. There has been a doubling of the applications under the new scheme. So this is the real proof of the additional benefits which the Government has made available since November 1988 to defence service home loans recipients and of the misleading nonsense which is contained--

       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       That federal Parliament acknowledges the need in this country for the legal system to more fully recognise the plight of victims of crime instead of directing the focus of most attention towards protecting and creating rights and privileges for the perpetrators of crime.
      </para>
      <para>
       I want to give some recognition in this debate today to the great frustration that exists out there amongst decent people in our community who feel that the law is disturbingly evolving more and more towards going overboard in the direction of protecting the rights of criminals above what is reasonably necessary, and that this is being done at the expense and neglect of the victims of crime.
      </para>
      <para>
       Amongst the victims I include not just the direct and immediate victim, but often the family and relatives of the victim. For example, obviously if the victim is murdered, that person's anguish ceases, but the trauma, heartbreak and immense disruption to lifestyles will continue to occur within the victim's family, often for the rest of their lives. These are the forgotten victims that our legal system all too often totally and callously ignores. I believe we are a lesser society because of that lack of consideration.
      </para>
      <para>
       A whole industry has built up around securing the rights of criminals, which many feel borders on the excessive; by contrast, too often a vacuum of concern seems to exist around the victims. I stress that I am not questioning the principle that whoever is accused should be presumed innocent until proven guilty-not at all. That is one of the central pillars of our judicial system.
      </para>
      <para>
       I am talking about something else-something that I am sure all honourable members will have encountered. I can best illustrate it, in the limited time available, by using an example of a tragic case from my electorate. I say `tragic' because the perpetrator of that crime has seemingly suffered little compared with the members of the family of the victim, who have all but had the rest of their lives destroyed.
      </para>
      <para>
       The example I use is the Hughes family in Brewarrina. On 21 January 1988 the family's son, Brendan, who was 19 years old-just 10 days short of his twentieth birthday-finished work at the local hotel, one of the three jobs he held down in that town, and drove to the house of his girlfriend, Sharon.
      </para>
      <para>
       A short distance before her house, a group of people were gathered in the middle of the road. When Brendan pulled into Sharon's driveway, the group followed him, hurling abuse in an attempt to start a fight. Within a space of seconds, one of the group, Wayne Wise, pulled a knife, lent over the fence and stabbed Brendan through the heart-he was dead before he hit the ground.
      </para>
      <para>
       When police arrived, Wise ran out in front of the vehicle, triumphantly holding aloft the knife still red with Brendan's blood, screaming for them to lock him up. Brendan's father, Kevin, and his sister, Katrina, having been alerted by Sharon's flatmate, were there to witness Wise's sickeningly jubilant confession. As the police led Wise away, Kevin approached the paddy-wagon and asked him `why in God's name' he had done it. Wise, an Aborigine, stared back belligerently and said, `A white for a black'. Kevin had to be dragged away from the van by police.
      </para>
      <para>
       What ensued in the 10 months it took to bring Wise to sentencing is a sad and frustrating indictment of our judicial system. Wise was granted bail of only $1,000, which was eventually revoked at the second hearing in Bourke, after a great deal of pleading from Brendan's heartbroken parents. A murder trial was set down to be heard at Bathurst. The Hughes's and other subpoenaed witnesses gave their testimony and statements in preparation for the trial.
      </para>
      <para>
       However, only three days before the set murder trial date, a visibly upset Brewarrina policeman delivered the message that there would be no murder trial; that the crown prosecutor, without consultation with the Hughes family, had accepted the plea bargaining; that the charge would now be manslaughter; that there would be no trial, merely a hearing; and no subpoenaed witnesses would be appearing. All of the statements and testimony given by the Hughes family and other witnesses for the prosecution were excluded since there was a new charge and a new set of proceedings.
      </para>
      <para>
       The manslaughter hearing date was set for Bathurst, to be heard by Justice Roden-of New South Wales Independent Commission Against Corruption fame. Kevin Hughes, the father, went to Bathurst-some seven hours drive-to be there when his son's murderer was sentenced. The case was adjourned. Kevin asked to be advised when the case would come up and he drove the seven hours back to Brewarrina, where he and his wife, Mary, have run the local Ampol service station and depot for years. That was on Friday. On Monday, Kevin received a phone call to say that the trial would be that day. He drove straight to Bathurst, only to be told the trial had been adjourned until Tuesday. On Tuesday, it was again adjourned so Kevin, unable to spend more time or money, went home.
      </para>
      <para>
       On Wednesday, a police sergeant from Brewarrina delivered the news to a stunned Hughes family that the case had been heard that morning. Wayne Wise had been convicted of manslaughter and sentenced to a mere seven years gaol, with a non-parole period of three years. Wise was released on special bail conditions-which he soon breached-after serving only 19 months of his sentence. No-one bothered to inform the Hughes family of his release.
      </para>
      <para>
       For the duration of that whole ghastly business, the family was left in the dark-they learnt of developments mostly after the fact and then only as a result of their determination to hang in there. The family was offered no support beyond the kindness of the local police who, like the Hughes family, were also not kept informed of what was happening.
      </para>
      <para>
       Kevin and Mary Hughes, like the families of countless other victims of violent crime, feel betrayed by a legal and judicial system which fails to recognise that they, too, are victims and should be given the consideration afforded by a society that prides itself, quite rightly, on the protection of the innocent.
      </para>
      <para>
       That Brendan Hughes's family are also victims is painfully apparent after talking to his parents, who feel that proper justice was not done to atone for their son's death. His father, Kevin, carries perhaps the most visible of the emotional scars. He is unable to quell the extreme hate towards his son's murderer, which consumes him to the point of total distraction. When one talks to him, he speaks with the kind of unashamed emotion that brings a lump to the listener's throat; he speaks of `a force beyond his control'. He wants to take revenge against the `derelict bastard who snuffed out my lovely boy'. Kevin says that he used to be a `pleasant, happy, easy going bloke; now I am angry-I am angry and bitter and churned up'.
      </para>
      <para>
       Kevin finds it hard to believe that his son Brendan is gone. He goes to the cemetery to talk to Brendan. He keeps photographs everywhere and plays games with himself, like imagining that Brendan is on an overseas trip from which he will soon return. He has lost interest in his business. In fact, Kevin says he does not `give a stuff' about anything. He cannot get motivated with his business, his family or his friends-he is consumed only with `hate, indescribable hate' and with a `longing for Brendan that won't go away'.
      </para>
      <para>
       His wife, Mary, has also suffered the strain of trying to hold the family together, whilst coping with her own unbearable grief that has taken its toll. In the months following Brendan's murder, their marriage became increasingly strained, with each locked into their own private grief and, numb to the needs of those around them, they could do little to help each other.
      </para>
      <para>
       Mary has had to seek relief from sleeplessness and anxiety in the form of medication. She has stopped taking sleeping tablets on a regular basis, but still takes the tranquillisers. She is frightened of possible addiction, but more afraid of losing her control. She feels she will never stop mourning Brendan. She finds Christmas and birthdays particularly hard to cope with.
      </para>
      <para>
       Most of all, Mary is shocked that her family was treated by the legal system with such indifference, lack of interest and consideration, as if they had no feelings at all and did not even exist. All that she originally expected was that justice would be done and that her son's murderer would be punished. Instead, Mary feels that it was her family that was put on trial and that `the criminal's rights and welfare were more important'.
      </para>
      <para>
       This is a classic case. I could quote dozens of other cases, which I have here in a folder before me, of people who have come to see me. There are thousands of innocent victims of crime in this country. We know about the classic cases of the Anita Cobby murder and the Janine Balding murder, and so on. Those families will never fully recover from the horror of the subhuman violence and senselessness of their children's deaths.
      </para>
      <para>
       The whole criminal system seems to be centred around those who have perpetrated these murders and other criminal actions. There is little or no consideration, in many cases, afforded to those who are the victims of crime, whether they are the direct victim or the relatives or friends of the victim.

        â€”I rise to speak against the motion before the House. The motion arises out of ignorance-ignorance of the general principles underlying the criminal justice system and ignorance of significant reform undertaken in recent years. The criminal law, and its enforcement, is there to protect us all. The detection and punishment of offenders protects society by deterring the offender and like minded people from committing offences.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       In the same way, the requirement of proof beyond reasonable doubt protects us all from false, malicious and trumped-up charges. Without such protection, checks and balances we would quickly become a totalitarian State like Nazi Germany. We can all understand the plight of the victims of crime. We sympathise with them. The infliction of punishment, the severest punishment, does not help the victim.
      </para>
      <para>
       The provision of compensation does to an extent meet the needs of the injured; the infliction of punishment does not. We live in a civilised society. Even if we reverted to the death penalty for serious crimes, that would not satisfy the victims of those crimes. We entrust the imposition of penalties to judicial officers who can view the matter of the sentence impartially, bearing in mind the interests of the community at large. Anyone who suggests that judges do not take into account the plight and suffering of victims in the sentencing process does not understand that process.
      </para>
      <para>
       There are other matters to be taken into account, too. There have been significant reforms in recent years to recognise the plight of the victims of crime. Some of these reforms are changes to criminal procedures; others are of a more general nature. I can give honourable members some examples from New South Wales, the jurisdiction in which I have had experience, and I understand there have been similar moves in other States and Territories.

       Some examples are: the installation of closed circuit television so that victims do not have to give their evidence in a courtroom in the presence of an alleged offender; streamlining the committal process, thus limiting the cases in which victims have to give evidence twice; changing the Oaths Act so that children of tender years can give prima facie evidence; preventing cross-examination of victims of sexual assault upon their prior sexual experience; encouraging offenders to plead guilty by rewarding them with a reduced sentence, so that the victim does not have to give evidence; reducing court delays and thus the length of time a victim is in limbo, uncertain of the outcome; victim impact statements; increasing the maximum amount of compensation that victims of crime can receive; funding of centres to support the victims of crime, such as rape crisis centres and women's refuges; reforming the laws on domestic violence so that the victims of such violence can more easily make complaints and be protected; conducting education campaigns so that victims under the system can feel more comfortable giving evidence; and abolishing remissions.
      </para>
      <para>
       Those reforms are the sorts of things that have been done, and can be done, without disturbing the overall balance that a system of justice must maintain. The plight of victims is best met by socio-economic measures such as compensation, support, counselling and increasing funding for rape crisis centres and women's refuges rather than tinkering with the court system and upsetting the balance we have achieved, which might well see innocent people gaoled.

      <para>
       Take, for example, the trial of Tim Anderson and the subsequent quashing of Anderson's conviction by the New South Wales Court of Criminal Appeal on 6 June 1991. I commend to honourable members the judgment of the Chief Justice in that case. It makes compelling reading. That case demonstrates the grave dangers that accompany overzealous prosecutions. A gung ho prosecutor might make the victims feel good during the trial. A prosecutor who feels sorry for a victim and overzealously presses the crown case serves the interests of neither the victim nor the accused, nor those of the community at large. Such misbehaviour by a crown prosecutor results in people like Tim Anderson being wrongly convicted and sent to gaol. That is not just.
      </para>
      <para>
       Gung ho prosecutors are no more interested in the victims of crime than they are in the accused or in justice. They are only interested in their own ego, their own advancement. Do honourable members think that the victims of the rapes have been helped by the way the New South Wales police trumped up charges against Harry Blackburn? If the New South Wales Director of Public Prosecutions has his way, things are going to get worse for victims of crime in New South Wales. He wants to import the American district attorney (DA) system into this country. Prosecutors will no longer be objective and independent; their role will be merged with the investigative role. We will have DAs conducting beat-up interviews on the steps of courts and at crime scenes. Such a proposal challenges the very jury system as we know it.
      </para>
      <para>
       Why this sudden attraction to the DA system by the New South Wales Director of Public Prosecutions, Mr Reg Blanch, QC? Only last year he was telling the Blackburn Royal Commission that the American model was inappropriate and stressed that the investigative and prosecutorial roles had to be kept separate if prosecutors were to retain their objectivity and independence. That was last year. This year he is dispatching one of his crown prosecutors to Los Angeles to check out the DA system. That system does not serve the victims of crime very well-plea bargaining is entered into to patch up shoddy investigations, leaving victims so unhappy with the results that they take the law into their own hands.
      </para>
      <para>
       A crown prosecutor's job is not to get a prosecution at all costs; it is to present the case fairly and not complain about the verdict. Preoccupation with securing a conviction at all costs does not serve the interests of the victim any more than it does the interests of justice. An even-handed, fair and objective prosecutor serves the interests of us all, the interests of justice and, among others, the victims of crime. The excessive zeal of prosecutors can be a real threat to a fair jury trial, as in the Tim Anderson case.
      </para>
      <para>
       I have been a lifelong believer in the value of trial by jury. Recent events have confirmed my belief. Trial by jury should be maintained and extended as far as possible. The main threat to trial by jury is the increasing tendency to trial by media in newsworthy cases. Some sections of the media are tending more and more to attempt to orchestrate trials by publication of prejudicial material before and during certain trials. This trend needs to be resisted at all costs.

        â€”I am very surprised at what I have just heard from the honourable member for Banks (Mr Melham). He has said that he is opposed to the motion before the House. To fit it with the logic of his debate is extraordinary. It is necessary for me to draw to the attention of the House, and indeed of those who have the opportunity of listening to this debate, what we are debating. The motion is:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       That federal Parliament acknowledges the need in this country for the legal system to more fully recognise the plight of victims of crime instead of directing the focus of most attention towards protecting and creating rights and privileges for the perpetrators of crime.
      </para>
      <para>
       My colleague the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) did not challenge the principle of proof beyond reasonable doubt. He did not call into question trial by jury. The burden of his argument was that the main focus in our present court system is on defending the principles of proof beyond reasonable doubt and trial by jury and the rights and privileges of those who are accused. Of course we want to protect those rights in accordance with what is described as British justice and the jury system! No-one is challenging that. But what we are concerned about is the great burden that the perpetrators of crime impose upon those against whom that crime is perpetrated and their families.
      </para>
      <para>
       It was interesting to hear the speech of the honourable member for Banks. In parts of his speech I would have thought he was proposing and supporting the motion. But he prefaced his remarks by saying that he was opposed to it, and I am absolutely amazed at that. Over the past two decades there has been a growing emphasis, both overseas and, thankfully, in Australia, on recognising the needs and rights of the victims of crime-the citizens who suffer as a result of the criminal acts of others. In the past the victims' interests have been neglected, not only by the agencies administering the legal system but by criminologists and researchers. Fortunately, the situation is changing, and more change is needed. Increasingly, there are significant moves being made to accommodate the needs of the victims of crime.
      </para>
      <para>
       There are distinct issues to be considered, some of which were referred to by the honourable member for Banks. We need to consider the impact of offences, the fear of crime by the victims of crime, the role and status of victims within the criminal justice system, and the need for better information and consultation. The current emphasis on victims' rights is part of a general need to create a more just, responsible and responsive criminal justice system, and that is what this motion is calling for-a process which in no way automatically conflicts with protecting the rights of the accused. There is a need for the debate on this question to define who are the victims of crime.
      </para>
      <para>
       In South Australia there is some pacesetting legislation which has been paralleled in some but not all other States. A scheme has been set up to compensate those who suffer injury and, in some cases, for those who suffer financial loss or financial grief. These issues need to be debated so that the sort of case to which the honourable member for Parkes has referred is handled with more understanding and sensitivity as part of the administration of the whole criminal justice system.
      </para>
      <para>
       There needs to be government support, both at Commonwealth level and at State level, for organisations such as the one that exists in South Australia, the Victims of Crime Service. This is a body whose role is to assist victims of crime, not in the compensatory sense-that comes through the compensation scheme-but by giving them support within the community to help cope with and overcome the trauma and stress imposed upon them. The fact that Government members have chosen not to support this motion simply amazes me. I would have thought every member of the House would see value in supporting it.

        â€”I do not see anything wrong with the motion before the House, although I do have some differences with some of the remarks of the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb). I have very serious concern about the manner in which the criminal justice system operates and the way in which it is loaded to favour the perpetrators of crime and those who represent them, as opposed to the general members of the community. I have already raised in this House on an earlier occasion what I consider to be the need for special resources to be allocated to tracing and discovering the perpetrators and making more difficult the robbery of private houses. It is one of the crimes that is growing in every State of Australia, despite what was said in that previous debate by some honourable members opposite. It is growing, and violence is growing with it.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       The position of the person who has his home invaded, who is threatened and who probably never recovers from the event is certainly not protected by the law. The law protects the perpetrator. We had an incident a couple of years ago in Victoria, probably well within the law, in which a person invaded a home where a 18-year-old boy was with his 14-year-old sister. He got a rifle and took a shot at the intruder. It was a time when there was a lot of violence against people in that particular area, including rape. The person was warned, but he was lucky that he was not prosecuted because in seeking to defend himself and his sister he had perpetrated a crime against an intruder in the only way he could within his own home. It is true that the law as it stands at the moment protects criminals who invade houses and allows them to sue the householder for damages if they are able to establish that the householder has been careless or has done something that could have been designed to cause injury to a person breaking into his house. That is the law in most States of Australia now.
      </para>
      <para>
       I think it is fair to say that the persons in our society who benefit most from criminal activities are a small group of barristers who defend the criminal. I heard of a case recently of a person who was tried-these are not necessarily the general cases-and because of improperly presented evidence, evidence which I think the judge said was manufactured, the case was dismissed. The person had to sell his home in order to provide the money for his defence. Had he been a major criminal who had available to him substantial amounts of money from the crimes he had been involved in he would have had no trouble having the best legal brains in the country to defend him.
      </para>
      <para>
       That is where the problem really lies. An ordinary householder who has only the protection of an insurance claim, which is sometimes no protection at all, has no access to the law, no access to first-class counsel, and no access without extreme cost and worry to the vehicles that are necessary in order to have the law applied; but the criminal does have that access. In every way possible the perpetrators of crime are advantaged. That is the way in which the law in Australia has evolved. It is the way the Supreme Court rules and the way the rules of court operate, and it is certainly financially the inevitable result of the manner in which the law is applied. There are some areas available to ordinary people, but not many. The person who is seriously injured or is psychologically injured-the woman who loses the wedding presents she has had for 50 years, which may not add up to a lot of money in insurance but constitute those things on which her memories are based or on which the family's traditions are based-has lost more than money, but that person's access to the law is according to how much he or she can afford, not what can be creamed off.

        â€”I wish to continue the remarks I was making on 7 March, when this motion first came on for debate. I want to deal with the degree of ownership and control or linkage between Murdoch's News Ltd and the Adelaide News. It is a subject of much debate and concern and would be referred to any inquiry into the Australian print media.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       It is interesting to look at what working journalists have said about the Murdoch empire. Matt Abraham, a former press gallery journalist with Murdoch's Adelaide Advertiser, now with Australian Broadcasting Corporation radio, was recently discussing the influence of Murdoch in Australia's print media, along with journalist Paul Chadwick and Eric Beecher, former editor of the Melbourne Herald. Matt Abraham revealed how a former editor of the Adelaide Advertiser, Mr Piers Ackerman, said that the Adelaide News journalists should be thankful to Rupert Murdoch for their jobs. In an interview Abraham went on to say:
      </para>
      <para>
       Piers Ackerman, who is now editor of the Melbourne `Herald', when he was editor of the `Advertiser', told me that in relation to the Adelaide `News'-which is also well linked to Mr Murdoch, he told me that every journalist should carry a photo of Mr Murdoch around in his wallet and kiss it every day. In other words, a lot of journalists have jobs with Mr Murdoch and they should be thankful for it.
      </para>
      <para>
       In his interview with Abraham on 12 March, Paul Chadwick said in relation to Murdoch's control of metropolitan daily newspapers:
      </para>
      <para>
       . . . for the record, if you take the normal measure of adding up the circulations directly owned, of metropolitan daily newspapers, Mr Murdoch comes out with about 61% at the moment. He controls, in effect, the fate of the Brisbane `Sun,' and the Adelaide `News,' through a complex arrangement that we haven't got time to go into. That takes him to 70% roughly, and then of course, the next biggest is Fairfax with about 19%.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Abraham interview continued with Eric Beecher, formerly one of Mr Murdoch's editors, who revealed how he had come under continuous and subtle and overt pressure from Murdoch henchmen over political coverage and coverage of some of News Corporation Ltd's other interests. The following is part of that interview, which commences with Abraham saying:
      </para>
      <para>
       . . . we will take the views now of Eric Beecher, formerly one of Mr Murdoch's editors. He was hired to try and revive the failing Melbourne Herald after Mr Murdoch took control of the Herald and Weekly Times group, and for the first time since he resigned, Mr Beecher has publicly blamed subtle and overt pressure by Murdoch executives as one of the key reasons he left.
      </para>
      <para>
       Eric Beecher is on the line now. Well, when you talk about subtle and overt pressure, what do you mean?
      </para>
      <para>
       To that question Eric Beecher replied:
      </para>
      <para>
       . . . that was taken slightly out of context. I mean, the reason I left was a combination of continuous subtle and overt pressure from the management of News Corp, across a whole range of issues, including political coverage and including coverage of some of News Corp's other interests, and a whole range of things. But there was also far less subtle and more overt pressure towards the end of my period there, where basically they wanted to turn the newspaper into something rather more tabloid and popular, which is what they subsequently did, once they got rid of me. And rather than just simply say so, they brought in some henchmen executives who kicked me around for a few weeks, and I just left.

      <para>
       I find this debate on the motion before the House full of contradictions. The previous speakers on the Government side, the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) and the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr John Scott), have called for a royal commission into the concentration of media ownership in Australia. They feel that such a royal commission would redress their concerns about media manipulation, political bias, censorship, freedom of journalistic expression and concentration of control of public opinion in the hands of a very few media moguls who act from self-interest and not necessarily in the national interest.
      </para>
      <para>
       I accept that both the honourable member for Fraser and the honourable member for Hindmarsh are genuine in their concerns. However, I find it impossible to accept the contradiction that just a few short weeks ago both those honourable members supported and voted for draconian legislation, which was guillotined through this House without full and proper debate, to ban political advertising in the electronic media in Australia. Surely honourable members can see the contradiction? The Government is taking from Australians the right to be informed. Political parties of all persuasions will not now have the opportunity even to buy the right of reply to the very real dangers inherent in this suppression of the democratic rights of freedom of expression addressed by this motion.
      </para>
      <para>
       If Government members are concerned that concentration of media ownership restricts journalistic licence and freedom of expression, the political advertising ban only exacerbates the very real dangers inherent in this motion. Instead of supporting this motion, honourable members opposite should perhaps have introduced a private member's Bill to repeal the political advertising ban legislation. If newspaper editors and television and radio journalists are unduly influenced by the ownership-the media barons-the Government legislation is directly contradictory to the spirit of this motion. If they are honest with themselves, Government members cannot support both; they cannot have it both ways.
      </para>
      <para>
       Honourable members opposite imply that they are not prepared to leave the future of Australia in the hands of the Murdochs, Packers and Fairfaxes of this world; well, I am not prepared to leave the education and informing of Australian voters to these media barons or to the Laurie Oakeses, Paul Lynehams or Quentin Dempsters of this world. My worry is not what these people say to the electorate; it is what they choose to omit. Too often people are presented with only one side of the debate, one side of the story. The Government has taken away the right to present the other side, which is the fundamental right of defence.
      </para>
      <para>
       I agree entirely with my colleague the honourable member for Ryan (Mr Moore), who spoke on this motion on an earlier day. Members of the Left of the Australian Labor Party (ALP) mostly do stand up for their principles, but on this occasion they have not-their true beliefs are embodied in this motion, not in the political advertising ban legislation.
      </para>
      <para>
       We may well ask: what would a royal commission achieve? I suggest it would achieve nothing. The information Government members would seek through a royal commission is already available and has been well documented and researched ad nauseam by academics not only Australia-wide but worldwide. Honourable members opposite also ought to remember that Australia is in a worsening recession-a recession which is of their making. A commitment of tens of millions of dollars to conduct a royal commission cannot be justified in this recessionary climate. There are too many publicly funded inquiries already under conduct in Australia today, some of which are achieving very little. For example, the Goss Government in Queensland has perfected the art of government by inquiry. It is now conducting public inquiries into the findings of other inquiries, all at a massive cost to the taxpayers.
      </para>
      <para>
       Apart from academic research into media concentration, there have been numerous other inquiries, the results of which are available to all and sundry. The honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith), who is the Opposition spokesman on communications, recently issued a position paper which reiterated the Opposition's policy. The paper notes, inter alia, that:

      </para>
      <para>
       The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure found in its June 1990 report Inconsistencies in the Regulation of the Media:
      </para>
      <para>
       (a) no increase in concentration for metropolitan dailies, achieved by the TPC requiring News to sell its papers in Adelaide and Brisbane to prevent monopoly.
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) an increase in number, but a concentration in market share from 52% in 1986 . . . to 62% in 1988 . . . in the national market thus questioning whether the TPC was correct in saying ownership concentration was not increased by the takeover of HWT by News.
      </para>
      <para>
       In its May 1989 report Mergers, Takeovers and Monopolies, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs recommended that:

       should take place via the Trade Practices Commission. It did not recommend a royal commission. The Government is yet to respond to that report. There is an old saying, `If you don't stand for something, you will fall for anything.' I think it is time the Government stopped inquiring and started governing.

        â€”The Opposition did not have a great deal to say in the speech of the honourable member for Fairfax (Mr Somlyay).
       </para>

      <para>
       I am very pleased to support the motion of the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore), which was last debated in this House on 7 March and debate on which resumes today. The motion lists the serious problems which concentration of press ownership has already caused and will continue to cause. It leads to an unacceptable concentration of power; it restricts diversity of information, ideas and opinion; it diminishes local content and accountability; and, perhaps most importantly, it erodes the proper working of the democratic process of our society, where the circulation of information and opinion is absolutely essential.
      </para>
      <para>
       This where the honourable member for Fairfax (Mr Somlyay) completely misunderstands the motivation behind this motion. We are about stopping those with money from monopolising the media. That is exactly what the ban on paid political advertising does also. There is nothing in the legislation-which bans paid political advertising-which prevents news, comment, public affairs or the circulation of information, opinion or ideas. All it does is prevent those with an abundance of money from monopolising paid advertising. The distinction is very clear. The fact is that this proposed motion conforms absolutely with the spirit that is behind our ban on paid advertising.
      </para>
      <para>
       A number of the arguments in favour of the call for a royal commission have already been put very well indeed, both previously and again today, by my colleagues the honourable member for Fraser and the honourable member for Hindmarsh (Mr John Scott), and also by the honourable member for Ryan (Mr Moore), whose comments I will return to in a minute. They have graphically put the case for an extensive inquiry into the Australian press-a royal commission which would have both the power and the independence to analyse fully all of the problems which, as the honourable member for Fairfax said, we actually know are there. The honourable member for Fraser said:
      </para>
      <para>
       A public inquiry, backed by research resources and the power to obtain evidence, would take the matter out of the hands of the proprietors, who have the most to fear from analysis of their comfortable position.
      </para>
      <para>
       I totally agree. Of course, the public has nothing at all to fear from such a process.
      </para>
      <para>
       It is undoubtedly the case that, while concentration of media ownership in television, radio and press in Australia has long been a problem, the last five years have seen a dramatic increase in concentration of the ownership of the print media. In fact, it can be argued that the introduction of the cross-media rules into the Broadcasting Act at that time created the driving force which caused proprietors to focus on one particular type of media. They got out of one area and expanded into another. In the case of Rupert Murdoch, his expansion went on in the print media; in the case of Kerry Packer it meant television.
      </para>
      <para>
       However, it is the print media which we are debating here and the threat to the proper working of the democratic processes which the concentration of ownership in the print media has the potential to bring about. The May 1991 issue of the Journalist contains an article entitled `National update on media ownership' which gives the most recent figures on the extreme concentration of that ownership. In 1986 there were 19 major metropolitan daily newspaper titles across Australia. The ownership break-up was: eight owned by the Herald and Weekly Times Ltd, representing 48 per cent of total circulation; six owned by News Ltd-that is, Murdoch-representing 28 per cent of total circulation; and five owned by John Fairfax and Sons Ltd, representing 24 per cent of total circulation. That is fairly concentrated ownership in itself, but by 1991-a mere few years later-the position became much worse.
      </para>
      <para>
       Only five years later the ownership break-up became, as it is now: nine metropolitan daily newspapers owned by News Ltd, which, as everyone has said, is 70 per cent of total circulation; three owned by the Fairfax group, which is 19.5 per cent of total circulation; and two owned by smaller proprietors. If we equate these figures to readership it means that almost 2,100,000 out of every 2,970,000 newspapers circulated every day are controlled by News Ltd. It is hard to believe that we have allowed ourselves to get into this position. As the motion we are debating says:
      </para>
      <para>
       . . . the concentration of ownership of the press . . . is unprecedented in Australia's history and unparalleled in any Western democracy . . .
      </para>
      <para>
       The situation could well deteriorate further after the receivers have broken up the Fairfax empire. That could leave News Ltd in an even more dominant position-if one can cope with imagining that.
      </para>
      <para>
       So how do newspaper proprietors use their undoubted power to influence public opinion and public policy? The British Broadcasting Corporation television documentary Empire: An examination of Rupert Murdoch's financial empire, which was broadcast on the 7.30 Report of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation on 27 December last year-and was mentioned by the honourable member for Ryan-gives us some clues. First of all, however, it is interesting to quote Mr Murdoch himself. He said:
      </para>
      <para>
       I think the important thing is that there'd be plenty of newspapers with plenty of different people controlling them, so that there's a variety of viewpoints-there's a choice for the public. This is the freedom of the press that is needed. Freedom of the press mustn't be one-sided just for a publisher to speak as he pleases and try and bully the community. There must be an alternative.
      </para>
      <para>
       So says Mr Murdoch, and we can only agree with such statements. But the evidence as to Mr Murdoch's ownership of Australian newspapers certainly highlights an inconsistency in his own approach. I am not quite sure that he practises what he preaches.
      </para>
      <para>
       There are also clues regarding undue influence on editorial stance. In that television program, journalist Christopher Hird spoke about Margaret Thatcher prior to her election as British Prime Minister in 1979. He said:
      </para>
      <para>
       [She] was a regular visitor to Sun editorial meetings. The Sun backed her enthusiastically during the campaign.
      </para>
      <para>
       Of course, we all know that she won the election. Then two years later when Mr Murdoch bought both the Times and the Sunday Times his purchase was not, as it apparently should have been, referred by the Thatcher Government to the British Monopolies Commission. Former Times journalist Anthony Holden said of this incident:
      </para>
      <para>
       I think it's very important to realise that Murdoch was in cahoots with Mrs Thatcher from very early on in her first government, and even more important, perhaps, Mrs Thatcher wanted Rupert Murdoch to own the Times. The papers he already owned, the Sun and News of the World, had been extremely supportive of her in the `79 election. For him to own the Sunday Times and Times as well, and presumably lend their support to her, I'm sure is the main reason why an application that screamed to be referred to the Monopolies Commission-45 per cent of all circulation-was rushed through by John Biffen, the Trade Secretary, in three days in the House of Commons.
      </para>
      <para>
       They complain about 45 per cent in Britain, but we have a 70 per cent Murdoch monopoly here.
      </para>
      <para>
       Another example concerns New York where another News Ltd newspaper, the New York Post, vigorously supported Mr Ed Koch as mayoral candidate. The mayor himself admitted later that he could not have won the election without that support. The interesting thing is that the journalists on the New York Post complained of the newspaper's election coverage. This is an interesting parallel with Australia in 1975, when News Ltd journalists went on strike in response to the biased editorial interference against the then Whitlam Labor Government.
      </para>
      <para>
       It was not just in the editorial comments that there was a problem; sometimes in those days news was actually suppressed. It just did not get into any of the newspapers. I well remember that at the time the ABC on its radio program AM had a section called `What the papers say' and in its desperate attempt to get some of the news out-it could not find it in the daily papers-it actually quoted the Tribune one morning. It was the first, and probably only, time that the Tribune got a guernsey on that program. Of course, the journalists ended up putting out their own newspaper.
      </para>
      <para>
       The point is that not only are the journalists affected, offended and affronted and their profession discredited by this monopoly ownership, but it shows how much we need media outlets such as the ABC. It is absolutely essential to the democratic process that we have a totally independent, publicly funded national broadcaster.
      </para>
      <para>
       These examples show that excessive power in the print media can be used to exert undue influence, change public opinion and-certainly in the case of the British example I have given-actually change public policy. This is why we have to have a royal commission. The Journalist says other questions which could be addressed in a royal commission are: do the major publishers also control the main printing facilities and the distribution networks; what kinds of barriers are there to the entry of newspaper proprietors into the market; if the newspaper industry contracts further, as is predicted, which will survive and what implications will this have for existing concentration of ownership; and, very importantly, how should public policy makers and the newspaper industry respond to all of this? The royal commission could also analyse the effectiveness or otherwise of the antimonopoly provisions contained within the Trade Practices Act.
      </para>
      <para>
       I support the motion strongly and commend it to the House. In a democracy the public exchange of views is absolutely essential and the public must be fully informed.

        â€”The honourable member for Phillip (Ms McHugh) obviously has a problem here because she cannot extricate herself from the obvious hypocrisy which is evident in the support of the Australian Labor Party (ALP) left wing for this motion, which has some commendable features. On the one hand, as the motion of the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) is presented to us, the Labor Party wants to promote freedom of speech. On the other hand, as the honourable member for Fairfax (Mr Somlyay) pointed out a little earlier, it wants to prevent it. I put it to honourable members opposite that they cannot have their cake and eat it too. Not even the left wing of the ALP, which is now I think the tail that is wagging the Government dog, can have its cake and eat it too in respect of this matter.

      <para>
       Concern is being expressed on both sides of this House about the high concentration of ownership of the print media and the potential it has for abuse of democracy. I believe what the honourable member for Fraser and the honourable member for Phillip and others have said is right: there is a concern about that. The Opposition shares that concern with them. In respect of the banning of freedom of speech through the banning of political advertising, we strongly oppose that motion and, as the honourable member for Fairfax said, we wanted to debate that fully but were prevented from doing so by the machinations of this Government.
      </para>
      <para>
       I believe the Government and these well-intentioned members who are supporting this motion will stand condemned because of what they have inflicted on the Australian people in respect of that legislation which bans people's rights to pay for advertising to put a political point of view on television and radio. The motion that the honourable member for Fraser is moving here today is in respect of the extent of the concentration of the ownership of the press and the effect this has on fair and accurate news. The motion of the honourable member for Fraser proposes a royal commission which would look closely at the regulatory framework that currently exists.
      </para>
      <para>
       The honourable member for Ryan (Mr Moore) and the honourable member for Fairfax in speaking to this motion have expressed some concerns that I think the Opposition would have in respect of a royal commission. That is not to say that we do not share the concern of the Government members who have spoken about the extent of the problem. Clearly there is concern about the current level of concentration of media ownership. In fact, as I think the honourable member for Fraser said, it is unprecedented in the history of this country. Particular concern has been expressed by honourable members on both sides about the extent of control that Rupert Murdoch's News Ltd effectively has with its 70 per cent ownership of the daily metropolitan newspaper circulation in Australia.
      </para>
      <para>
       Since 1985 the particular person who heads up that organisation has not been an Australian citizen. I put it to the Parliament that that is a cause for even greater concern because 70 per cent of Australia's print media is vested in a non-Australian citizen. It matters little, of course, whether he was an Australian citizen-as he was before he became an American citizen. I pose the question: should the newspaper industry be treated differently from the broadcast industry? I do not believe it should at all. In the broadcast media industry, foreigners are limited to a 20 per cent stake as far as ownership is concerned by changes that were steered through Cabinet last year. The Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) said:
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government believes it is vital that Australia's radio and television stations are owned and controlled by Australians because they are major outlets for political debate and exploration of cultural identity.
      </para>
      <para>
       I suggest that the same sort of consideration should apply to the print media. The two major objections to the foreign control of newspapers, that is, direct coverage and diminution of sovereignty, can result equally from Australian ownership. But I suppose with Australian ownership there is a sense in which Australian owners may be held more accountable.
      </para>
      <para>
       I want to talk about Mr Murdoch because there is no doubt in my mind that the Australian Labor Party for some time has been courting him. When the issue of a royal commission was raised earlier this year the then Treasurer, the honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating), said:

        â€”In supporting the motion moved by the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) I want at the outset to take very strong issue with the claim that has been made by the honourable member for McPherson (Mr Bradford) and the Opposition speaker before him, the honourable member for Fairfax (Mr Somlyay), which sought to link paid political advertising and issues relating to their opposition to the Government's legislation in the area of paid political advertising to a notion of free speech and the very legitimate concern about free speech, the right of freedom of expression, and the importance of ensuring diversity of freedom of expression that any Western democracy would seek to ensure was enshrined at all times in its political process and in its everyday way of life.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       There is no relationship between those two issues. It is completely errant on the part of the Opposition to seek to relate something that is paid for, influence that can be bought, to free speech. Also, it is completely wrong to suggest that in any sense the Government's legislation in the area of banning paid political advertising stops current affairs comment, public comment or other exchange going on. I think it is quite likely that, because influence will not be as pronounced through much of the commercial media because of its bought content, we are likely to have a cleaner and fairer public debate process occur in our media as a result of the ban. On balance, I think one would have to say that will be advantageous to the spirit of democracy and the right of information to develop and to be passed through to the community.
      </para>
      <para>
       What we are dealing with here is a key area of our democratic institutions, the importance of having a comprehensive, diverse media which in this country reflects the views of all Australians. Be it the majority opinion or the minority opinion, it is the range of views that we want to ensure our media portrays. It is only through that process that we get fair discussion and the right of people to make informed judgments about issues that confront them.
      </para>
      <para>
       Almost all of us rely very much on the media in all its manifestations. In this particular motion we relate to press ownership because it is a very important part of the broader public exchange that goes on. But looking at the principles as a whole, one has to say that a democracy relies totally for its strength in terms of these areas on all individuals having the right to put their views forward and for them to form their own ideas. The comprehensive media is an integral part of that process.
      </para>
      <para>
       The best way to ensure that is to have the principles that are applied in this motion before the House fully canvassed. Where we have, as we have with our press, a very heavy dominance-70 per cent-by one player, it gives legitimate rise to concerns that I suggest most democracies around the world would take very seriously if they were in the same situation. As a matter of principle, it is very hard to dispute that point. That being the case, there is a very strong argument that the public at large needs to investigate that issue much more seriously and much more comprehensively than has been contemplated in the past.
      </para>
      <para>
       This Parliament has recognised the importance of the media ownership because it has passed laws relating to cross-media arrangements. We are particularly concerned about the relationship of ownership in television and radio and so forth, but there is one area where there is a void-the press. If we are to take our responsibilities seriously and have concern for local and regional issues and the needs in our communities, we have to ensure there is a diversity of print media ownership, in the same way that in television and radio we are concerned to have very strong majority Australian ownership. We are also concerned to ensure that Australian identity, character and content are there.
      </para>
      <para>
       In relation to the press, we have a special opportunity to do that. It is all very well to say that the Trade Practices Commission can achieve that. We know that that is too narrow a constraint to apply in this area. For those reasons, I support the motion that has been put forward.

         â€”There is at present a national economic crisis, compounding a rural crisis in Australia. That national economic crisis is the worst that we have experienced since the 1930s. So when we look to the plight of particular sectors, we must do so also in the context of the national economic crisis and what it calls for, and what it should call for, in terms of a Government response, an industry response and an individual response.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        In Colac, in Victoria, 70 per cent of the population is now living on less than $18,000 a year. The Salvation Army is receiving five times the number of requests for help that it received at this time last year. A similar situation exists in St Arnaud and Bendigo. They are both rural areas surrounded by wheat and sheep producers, with unemployment levels running in excess of 15 per cent.
       </para>
       <para>
        The coalition recognises the nature and extent of the problems of the rural industries, and the extent of the crisis as I have just described it. We recognise the basic fact that our rural industries are among our most efficient industries. In many cases they are the best examples of producers or industries that have matched best international practice. To turn our general economic circumstances around we have to bring all those industries up to speed by international standards, to make sure that they do match those best international standards, and to remove the impediments-I emphasise `impediments'-that stand in the way of achieving it.
       </para>
       <para>
        I will give the House some examples of those impediments and refer firstly to the cost of fuel. In country areas of Australia fuel is at least 4c per litre dearer than city prices. Freight components are substantial in everything purchased in country areas. The freight on a new Holden utility transported from Melbourne to St Arnaud, for example, is $750.
       </para>
       <para>
        I turn to education: the cost of sending a country student to university is between $8,000 and $10,000 per annum. Austudy is about $5,000 on an income of $20,000. These are practical examples of what occurs in country areas of Australia. I now turn to communication costs. An average residential phone bill is probably in the vicinity of $150 to $200 per quarter. Farm averages, for example, are very much higher, with $400 being fairly usual-and that is probably a very conservative estimate.
       </para>
       <para>
        People living in country areas experience certain disadvantages in the communications area. For example, living about 250 kilometres from Melbourne would put us in the second highest phone charge category. Living 170 kilometres from Ballarat would put us in the third highest charge category. I am quoting these figures for calls from St Arnaud. The charge for a call to Melbourne between 8 a.m. and 6 p.m. is 39c per minute, between 10 p.m. and 8 a.m., 26c per minute, and on Sunday, 15c per minute. In rural communities, particularly in a business sense, where on most occasions one would be using the phone between the hours of 8 a.m. and 6 p.m., calls are charged at the higher rate of 39c per minute.
       </para>
       <para>
        In many instances, the spouses of farmers are finding that they have to find off-farm employment. That has been a regular occurrence in the farming community for some years, but it has built up particularly in the past 18 months, when more and more spouses have had to find off-farm employment. If the wife does not have off-farm employment, more and more she is becoming actively involved in practical farming. In many instances the spouse is running the farm while the husband is trying to find work away from the farm to supplement their income. The spouse then becomes involved not only in the practical farming but also in doing the books, cooking for the shearers and, in fact, all aspects of physical farming. Over a period, this has replaced hiring other people to do occasional work on the farm.
       </para>
       <para>
        I direct the House's attention to the fact that we should be looking at the nature of the problem faced by the rural sector. There are three reasons why the problem has emerged: firstly, poor world markets; secondly, poor domestic policy; and thirdly, what I would loosely collect as poor industry management, quite often in conjunction with poor Government policies.
       </para>
       <para>
        I turn firstly to poor world markets. There are two principal reasons why we have poor world markets. One is the poor world economic management-the fact that the world economy has slowed down and has now moved towards recession. What is worrying is that countries such as Japan-which six months ago people were arguing was recession-proof-are now looking as though they will be moving into recession as well. We cannot do a great deal about the poor world economic management, but we can express our views. We do that to the International Monetary Fund, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development and other forums, but they are not likely to listen to Australia. The best thing we can do, from our own point of view, is to get our own house in order in economic terms.
       </para>
       <para>
        The other reason why world markets are poor is that quite often subsidies and agricultural protection are in force in different parts of the world. Here we can do something. Both the Government and the Opposition have tried to do what we can in a small country in a large world in dealing with those issues.
       </para>
       <para>
        Some of our coalition members have led trade delegations to other parts of the world-in recent times, to Japan, China and Taiwan. In each case the delegation has been well accepted. For example, the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) visited Taiwan and put the case about discrimination against our wheat in terms of access to the Taiwanese market. He also put the case about discrimination against our beef, particularly in relation to competition between Australia and the United States for access to the Taiwanese market. However, I am led to believe that we will see some improvement in all three areas in the next six months. So we need to place maximum pressure at the bilateral level by individual trade missions and representations, and to ensure that government does a lot more about that.
       </para>
       <para>
        Secondly, the problem exists for the rural sector in poor domestic policy. The problems that affect this country can be fixed, although it might take a great amount of leadership-something that we have not seen from the Government in the last few years. A lot of the disadvantages to the rural sector have come from the interest rates and the associated effect that they have had on the exchange rate. I think that in terms of structural adjustment we need major market reform-a current issue which will be an essential element of what has to be done. Improvements in transportation and in land transport, waterfront reform, tax reform, including a broad-based goods and services tax, telecommunications and electricity pooling, and education-whatever the dimension of the problem as it affects the rural sector-offer solutions. We have identified policies in all of those areas which we believe can bring about a substantial shift towards greater efficiency.
       </para>
       <para>
        In Australia we pay between 20 per cent and 50 per cent more than our overseas competitors for coastal shipping, construction, international shipping, waterfront service, rail transport, international and domestic aviation, postal and telecommunications, electricity supply and water. Elimination of all of those cost disadvantages will change the face of our rural industries irrespective of the world circumstances in which we have to operate. It is important that the Government act on the measures that I have outlined. What we have experienced needs attention, and we must address that question.

       Domiciliary Nursing Care Benefit

         â€”I direct the attention of the House to the need for change in the eligibility criteria of the Department of Aged, Family and Health Services governing receipt of the domiciliary nursing care benefit. The introduction of that benefit is to be applauded, and I am not here today to denigrate or detract from those who now receive this benefit under the present criteria. However, I am increasingly being made aware of elderly citizens in my constituency of Grey who, with assistance from family and friends, are able to remain independent and live in their own homes and who are not receiving assistance from this benefit. These are not isolated cases. In fact, it has been made abundantly clear to me by senior citizens in my electorate that the benefit is not fulfilling the spirit of the law as it was intended.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The thrust of this Government's policy-and I am sure the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services (Mr Staples) will agree with me-is that all senior citizens in Australia should have the choice of remaining in their own homes where and whenever possible, or entering an aged care facility with a level of care suitable to their needs. Such choices give our elderly citizens control of their own lives and self-determination about where and how they will spend their remaining years, the winter of their lives. Not only does this self-determination help our elderly citizens maintain their independence, dignity and self-esteem; it also leaves the way free for our hostels and nursing homes to be made available for those who are frail, sick and elderly, needing constant supervised care and attention, ensuring that such facilities are utilised for those most in need.
       </para>
       <para>
        To demonstrate the need for change, I put to honourable members the case of one constituent in my electorate, Mrs Eva Bushell. Mrs Bushell is 85 years young and will be 86 next month. She has various problems and is under some medical supervision by her local general practitioner, who visits her in her home when necessary. I say 85 years young instead of old because Mrs Bushell is a proud, determined lady whose spirit is young, although the body is not always willing. Mrs Bushell requires daily assistance with her personal toilet and small jobs around the home. She is mobile around her little pensioner unit with the assistance of a walking frame.
       </para>
       <para>
        Most of us in this chamber would not be aware of the trauma with which individuals have to contend when they are no longer able to shower on their own or complete their intimate toilet, but instead have to depend on others to assist them with such personal intimacies. A friend of Mrs Bushell's comes in each day to assist her with her bathing and clothing. She undertakes errands for her and any other jobs required by Mrs Bushell for which the domiciliary care agency at Whyalla does not provide. Her friend Ruby does all this and more for $20 a week.
       </para>
       <para>
        My grievance today is that this payment, the $20 a week, has to be met by Mrs Bushell from her fortnightly pension. Why? Because Ruby does not live under the same roof as Mrs Bushell, the person being cared for, but instead lives one house away. Some may say that there are people in the community who would provide this service voluntarily, and I agree that this is so. However, provision of such a service on a voluntary basis does not take into account the feelings of the elderly person. Volunteers invariably are rostered for this type of work and, therefore, do not always look after the same group or, indeed, individual people on a continuous basis, much as they would like to do so. This means that an elderly person may have a number of different care-givers over a period.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is of prime importance that such services are provided on a continual basis by the same provider. It must be remembered that our elderly citizens were brought up in an era of modesty when privacy of one's affairs was paramount and intimacies were not entered into lightly. The care-giver must be a person who is known and trusted by the elderly citizen receiving such care.
       </para>
       <para>
        As I stated before, Mrs Bushell has this in Ruby, a friend who lives in the same street one door from her home and who visits her daily to provide loving care and attention. No matter how willing and caring volunteers are, the care of a family member or friend is irreplaceable to all of us, not only to our elderly citizens. One might ask the question, `Why does Mrs Bushell's friend take a payment?' The answer is that if she did not accept the payment, Mrs Bushell would not allow her to assist in the manner she is.
       </para>
       <para>
        Our senior citizens are a proud bunch, and rightly so. They are reluctant to receive such services free as they view that as charity. They have always maintained their independence and wish to continue to pay their way in life as they always have done. Many senior citizens feel that accepting such services from their friends is taking advantage of the friendship and is, in the end, charity. Their confidence and self-esteem is already at a low ebb by the very nature of the intimate service they are dependent upon.
       </para>
       <para>
        Therefore, I believe it is incumbent on us as a government to bring these providers under the umbrella of the domiciliary care nursing benefit. The dignity of the elderly person receiving care must be maintained at all times. Our elderly cannot be allowed to be subjected to trauma, as happens when care-givers are not personally known to them. With respect to eligibility for the domiciliary nursing care benefit, the pamphlet states:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . that any person who is caring for someone who would otherwise be admitted to a nursing home may receive the benefit. This means the person being cared for must need complete or almost complete help with tasks of daily living such as personal care, dressing and eating. The person being cared for must be at least 16 years of age and, be chronically ill or disabled, rather than recovering from surgery or an acute short term illness.
       </para>
       <para>
        The next criteria is where the problem arises. The pamphlet states:
       </para>
       <para>
        The person being cared for must live with the person applying for the benefit.
       </para>
       <para>
        Very often this is not suitable or convenient for either the carer or the person being cared for. In almost all instances, adequate daily care can be provided by the carer while the person being cared for lives independently. Care is given when required-for example, at meal times, for daily bathing and changing-and is not needed on a continual two-hour basis.
       </para>
       <para>
        A recent change to the Department of Social Security eligibility criteria for carer's pension, which has been in effect from 1 January this year, is that the carer is no longer required to live in the same house as the person being cared for. Provided the personal care and attention of constant supervision test is satisfied, the carer may live in an adjacent home. The change was a most welcome one and was in line with the Government's aim to allow the elderly of our nation to live independently for as long as possible.
       </para>
       <para>
        Each of us present today would acknowledge that for those elderly people who wish to live at home a home environment is more beneficial than a hostel or nursing home environment. In saying that, I do not knock nursing homes or hostels. I believe that in my electorate I have the best nursing homes and hostels in Australia. The care and attention that is given to people in these homes and hostels is nothing short of first class.
       </para>
       <para>
        Today I seek to make a change to the criteria for payment of the domiciliary nursing care benefit. I ask for the domiciliary care benefit criteria to be brought into line with the carer's pension to allow our elderly their right to stay in their own homes. Each case should be considered on the individual needs of the person requiring care. One needs to ask, `Does this person need 24-hour constant care or is assistance needed only for bathing or at meal times'? If the latter is the case, then it is only right that the person should not be required to live in the same house but only in close proximity to the person they care for.
       </para>
       <para>
        I call on the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services (Mr Staples) to give some support for this. I am delighted to see that the honourable member for Bowman (Mr Sciacca), who is the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Social Security, Senator Richardson, is in the House. I am sure that he will give support to the call that I make.

         â€”I draw the attention of the House to the fact that crucially important opportunities for this country are being thrown away by the continuing failure of the Government's policies on education and, indeed, by the disruption and damage which these policies are causing.

        Around the world the vital importance of education of world-class quality is recognised as an essential accompaniment to a broader program of economic reform. This Government has neither introduced the program of economic reform this country needs nor provided the essential backing for such a program by a commitment to build the quality of education in this country to world-class standards.
       </para>
       <para>
        Other countries have already recognised the problem and moved to address it. In April, President George Bush, who wants to be remembered as the education president, outlined his top priority program which he called `A revolution in American Education'. Recognising that the United States is no longer the undisputed economic leader in the world, he has developed an education strategy to make America competitive once again-in his words, `to create the competitive climate that stimulates excellence'.

        On 8 June, the recent edition of the British magazine the Economist in its leading editorial said:
       </para>
       <para>
        The best industrial policy is to keep inflation low, real interest rates gently positive and exchange rates stable. Then people will save and businesses will be naturally far-sighted . . . . After this, the most promising industrial initiative is to invest in human capital. A well-educated labour force able to acquire new skills and adapt to changing demands is the most valuable asset an economy can have.
       </para>
       <para>
        In discussing the economic significance of education, I in no way suggest or imply that education does not have a much broader role in providing the basis for a democratic society and fulfilment for its citizens. But we cannot avoid the fact that without education of world-class standard, the economic program of reforms which this country desperately needs will not be effective.
       </para>
       <para>
        We live in the most economically dynamic region in the world. The pace of economic growth and rising living standards has far outstripped the rest of the world. But we have to be in there competing. In his address to the National Press Club in February, Brian Loton, the former Chief Executive of Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd, very eloquently said what needs to be said. He stated:
       </para>
       <para>
        We cannot have a world class economy and a world class standard of living without a world class work force. And we cannot have a world class work force without world class education.

        Business has expressed its concern over the current condition of Australian education in many ways and particularly by establishing new organisations to promote community attention to the plight of Australian education. I refer to the Business Higher Education Round Table and to the Industry Education Forum, which this month unveiled its declaration of goals for Australian schools. It noted:
       </para>
       <para>
        Business and industry believe that the process of micro reform should be genuinely applied to the provision and delivery of education services . . . more flexible employment conditions for teachers and greater opportunities for them in their careers.

        That is precisely what has not happened under the policies of this Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        One-fifth of students in Australian primary schools have unsatisfactory levels of literacy. One in seven adult Australians has problems reading or writing. Research at the University of Western Australia found that 40 per cent of university graduates seeking to enrol in the Diploma of Education at that institution failed simple tests of literacy.
       </para>
       <para>
        This country has significant educational problems which are not being addressed by the most hands-on administration of the education portfolio under the present Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) that this country has seen. The philosophy with which that portfolio is administered-the philosophy of the education policies of this Government-is that quality can be achieved only by increasing uniformity, increasing control, and increasing centralised accountability. Every element of that philosophy is inappropriate to achieving the objectives that this country needs in education.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the tertiary system, we have seen the forced destruction of the binary system, an act of administrative vandalism that will take years to repair and which has had a devastating effect on morale throughout higher education in this country. The Government's attitude towards making use of the commitment to education in this country is shown by its attitude to the private sector, whether that be in schooling or in higher education. At every turn, this Government has sought to restrict the flow of resources into private non-government schooling and private tertiary education. Indeed, more than that, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training has attacked the most comprehensive efforts to provide tertiary education in the private sector at Bond University to the detriment and damage of that institution. Such is the leadership in education that we are getting at the present time.
       </para>
       <para>
        In its rhetoric of the clever country, the Government has placed enormous weight on the numbers of students going through the system. It has consistently ignored quality. In the Prime Minister's industry statement in March, symbolic gestures were made towards the demands of the Opposition and the community that some attention should be given to quality; they were no more than that.
       </para>
       <para>
        What we need in this country is an education policy in which excellence is acknowledged, identified and rewarded. We need a philosophy for education policy which sees education as aiming to bring the best out of every person, students and teachers, not one which makes sure that no-one can rise above the ruck because of the imposition of mediocrity on the system and uniform bureaucratic regulations arising from the beloved centralised industrial relations system on which this Government relies and which the Minister has sought to impose ever more tightly on schooling and higher education in this country.
       </para>
       <para>
        We need national achievement standards across the core disciplines of English, science, mathematics, and history so that the community can at last be informed about the quality of learning that is occurring in this country. We need a much more wide-ranging system of scholarships based on merit to make sure that our best and brightest young people, regardless of income, can go on to higher education. We need a much more flexible system of employment conditions for teachers and lecturers at all levels of education so that quality can be recognised, rewarded and, above all, recruited. We need to stop being embarrassed by the gifted in this country and make sure that they have the opportunities to excel in whatever field their gifts may lie.
       </para>
       <para>
        We need to make sure that we use and build on the language resources of this country so that Australians feel increasingly comfortable in, and able to operate in, all the countries whose trading links can help us build our prosperity. We need to overcome the disadvantages suffered particularly by students in rural Australia for whom participation rates are well below those of urban Australians.
       </para>
       <para>
        Above all, we need educational institutions which are flexible enough and have the freedom to respond to what the parents and students of this country are looking for. This means more independent schools and universities with flexible and accountable management. It means freeing schools and universities from the grip of bureaucracy and the regulation imposed by the industrial relations system and allowing them to be responsive to the demands of the community, which sees something this Government does not see-the need for a recognition of achievement, quality and excellence in education. It is only by moving education policy in that direction that we are going to achieve what we need-education of world-class standard.

         â€”My grievance today is about the failure of this Government and previous governments to grant to Australian wartime merchant mariners the same entitlements that are available to veterans in the defence forces. I believe that this Government and this Parliament must move, as soon as the legislative program will permit, to implement the recommendations of the McGirr inquiry into the pension status of merchant mariners who faced wartime service.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Over years of inaction by successive governments after World War II, there was a continuing failure to recognise the contribution that our merchant mariners made to the defence of this country and to the maintenance of the lifelines to this country. We did see, under the Fraser Government of 1981-82, the award of service pension to Australian mariners. In the subsequent year, we saw the extension of that to British and Allied merchant mariners.
       </para>
       <para>
        In 1989, this Government appointed Ms Jocelyn McGirr, Deputy President of the Repatriation Commission, to inquire into the needs of Australian mariners, both Commonwealth and Allied veterans and Allied mariners. That report was handed to the Government in October 1989. The report is regarded by former merchant mariners and more recently by the Returned Services League as the most important work that has been completed in that field.
       </para>
       <para>
        I also want to recognise the persistent efforts of one of my constituents, Mr Bob Nelson of Mount Hutton, and his colleagues for the achievements that they have made in arguing over decades the case for the rights of Australian merchant mariners and the need for this Government to recognise the contribution those merchant mariners made to Australia's defence and protection during World War II.
       </para>
       <para>
        I believe that the time is right to respond with the necessary legislative action to give merchant mariners equal access to the benefits that are now enjoyed by former defence personnel. Let me remind honourable members of the problems faced by merchant mariners in gaining pensions from the Commonwealth Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        Merchant mariners are currently covered by the Seamen's War Pensions and Allowances Act 1940. Under that Act, merchant mariners have to prove that they suffered a war injury during war service and the onus is on them to prove it. That may be easy, if it can be shown that one lost a limb during the course of service or under enemy attack, but the fact is that one had to survive. Although there was enough evidence given to the McGirr inquiry, ship logs recording such injuries were often subsequently lost in action. Obviously, if ships were sunk later in the course of the war or in a later engagement, no records existed. In many cases, the task of having to show that a war injury was suffered has been impossible.
       </para>
       <para>
        That burden of proof makes it difficult for an ex-merchant mariner to show that he suffered from, for example, lung cancer or from a respiratory disease as a result of wartime service. This restrictive nature of the Seamen's War Pensions and Allowances Act has meant that only 3 per cent of eligible Australian merchant mariners, or about 112 men, have been able to receive a pension.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let me contrast that with the case of veterans covered by the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986. They need only to show that they did indeed serve in the regular forces and that a reasonable hypothesis exists to link that service to their illness or disability. The claimant does not have to prove the link. Yet the McGirr inquiry found that the range of wartime experiences of Australian merchant mariners was comparable to the experiences of veterans of the Australian defence forces. Of this, there can be no doubt.
       </para>
       <para>
        Again, I turn to evidence given to the inquiry. I am very pleased that the Minister for Veterans' Affairs (Mr Humphreys) is here in the chamber to take on board these remarks. He knows only too well the privations and the suffering of Australian merchant mariners in the course of duty during World War II.
       </para>
       <para>
        I would like the Minister, on behalf of merchant mariners, to take to the Cabinet in the coming Budget deliberations the remarks that I am making today. According to the evidence given to the inquiry, Australian merchant mariners went to sea in ships that were not designed for warfare. They had little or no armour plating and many, in particular the smaller ships, were unarmed. A large merchant ship would have a crew of around 100 persons. A navy ship of comparable size would have in excess of 500 persons, including medical staff and facilities.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is a further, more telling comparison to be made between the conditions of service personnel and merchant mariners. According to evidence to the McGirr inquiry, navy sailors could, and often did, spend the entire war in a shore establishment, far removed from the war at sea. However, there was only one place for the merchant seaman and that was at sea in his ship, exposed to attack by submarines, surface raider or aircraft at any time, with the added risk of enemy mine fields laid in coastal waters. Of the 73 ships sunk, attacked or chased in Australian waters during World War II, 54 were merchant ships and 38 went to the bottom.
       </para>
       <para>
        Of course, many Australians served most of the years of World War II on the dangerous Atlantic run on ships of various nationalities. The merchant mariners on these trade routes were in particular danger. Enemy raiders were often given specific orders to avoid warships and instead concentrate their attacks on the carriers of grain, petroleum, munitions and equipment to try to cripple the Allied war effort.
       </para>
       <para>
        Overall, there were about 14,000 Australian merchant mariners engaged during World War II. The McGirr report estimated that 520 lost their lives. That is roughly equivalent to the casualty rate among servicemen. However, no-one knows, and there is no way of knowing, how many Australian merchant mariners lost their lives serving on foreign vessels. That information is not available. But we do know that at least 520 Australian merchant mariners lost their lives on Australian vessels.
       </para>
       <para>
        In these circumstances, it is just and right that the McGirr inquiry found that World War II Australian merchant mariners ought to be treated, as far as practicable, on an equal footing with the veterans of the defence forces. That means equal treatment benefits and equal access to disability pensions.
       </para>
       <para>
        I believe that this Government must act now and act before it is too late, because as these former merchant mariners age, their numbers dwindle. It will be poor reward and poor recognition if ultimately they are granted these entitlements when there are few of them left to enjoy them and to accept them.
       </para>
       <para>
        I thank the Minister for his efforts to date and wish him well. I assure him of the support of most members of this House-certainly members on this side of the House and a number on the other side of the House-for his efforts to ensure that Australian merchant mariners who served in World War II be granted the same access to treatment benefits and disabilities pensions as are available to veterans of the defence forces.
       </para>
       <para>
        A few weeks ago, in Newcastle, we conducted a service at Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd's Port Waratah wharf to commemorate the sinking of the Iron Chieftain and the Iron Knight in 1942. This was the forty-ninth commemoration of those sinkings. At that service were men who survived those sinkings. A couple of them may have understated their age to board the ship and serve at that time; I think a few 15-year-olds went to sea as 17-year-olds. But some did survive and to the Hunter region the shipping industry is a major part of our heritage.

        This nation was born out of shipping; it has developed on the shoulders of the shipping industry; its destiny lies with shipping. The Australian shipping industry and Australian seamen today can walk tall because they were there when their country needed them. The future will be that the merchant navy will work closer with the Royal Australian Navy as the nature of their tasks change. Australian seamen today, and the Australian shipping industry, can walk tall because they stand at the forefront of improvements in industry performance, productivity and modernisation. I put this request to the House and to the Minister in the belief that it can and ought to be accepted and implemented in the coming Budget.

         â€”I grieve for Australian small business. I grieve for both the employers and the employees in those 800,000 businesses around Australia, many of which are struggling to survive.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Recently, the Government presented its first annual report on small business to the Parliament. In a sense, this was welcome recognition of the vital role that small business plays in our economy. However, this fancy 55-page document is indicative of the Government's approach to small business. It is simply big on words, full of promise, but essentially it is just what the document is-just glossy rhetoric. We are attempting to find out how much this beautiful document cost-probably millions of dollars.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government built expectations in this small business community with the report of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology, the so-called Beddall report of January 1990 entitled Small Business in Australia: Challenges, Problems and Opportunities. That was a substantial document that made 66 recommendations on the basis of 182 submissions. Most of the substantive recommendations of that particular report, which was applauded by the small business community, have sunk without a trace.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Council of Small Business Organisations of Australia, which was one of the prime movers for the Beddall committee's inquiry, has described the Government's response to the Beddall report as pitiful. COSBOA states that many of the specific recommendations of the report are `subject to ongoing discussions with the Treasurer'. In its eyes, and I suggest it is correct, having ongoing discussions with the Treasurer simply means that the recommendations have been shelved or that the answer is no.
       </para>
       <para>
        The first annual report that I referred to on small business tabled in Parliament is also described by COSBOA as bordering on misinformation. COSBOA believes, and I certainly support its position on this, that the report should have clearly portrayed progress on each Beddall recommendation, one by one. COSBOA says in its response to the tabling of the report:
       </para>
       <para>
        Minister David Beddall's standing in the small business community has not been enhanced by this document.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is fair to say, to put this in context, that COSBOA believes that the Minister, in particular, does have the interests of the small business community at heart. He is well regarded within the small business community. However, despite what I believe to be the honest and legitimate commitment of the Minister to the report of the Committee which he chaired, nothing much has happened. I can only conclude, as does most of the small business community, that the Minister is a lightweight and that he is unable to convince his ministerial colleagues, or indeed the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), about the importance of the small business community to this country.
       </para>
       <para>
        COSBOA, in its submission to the Economic Planning Advisory Council (EPAC) in April last year, stated:
       </para>
       <para>
        It is essential that the Beddall report be used as a catalyst to stimulate a fresh approach to the small business sector.
       </para>
       <para>
        COSBOA also recommended at that time that regular reviews be coordinated and published through the small business unit, detailing briefly progress on all 66 of the Beddall Committee's recommendations and that other reforms identified in the area be outlined regularly at the same time. There has been no such report. There has been no such regular review of progress presented. The glossy document to which I have referred states:
       </para>
       <para>
        Small businesses have a fundamental role to play in improving Australia's economic performance and meeting the challenges of the 1990s.
       </para>
       <para>
        The report goes on to say:
       </para>
       <para>
        In the year to June 1990, total business bankruptcies rose by 41%. Data on the December 1990 quarter showed a sharp increase of 56% in total bankruptcies over the December 1989 quarter.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Minister, in Parliament and in the references in the report, attempts to explain away these bankruptcies. The attempts he has made to explain those bankruptcies as being as a result of poor management are completely hollow.
       </para>
       <para>
        Despite the recognition of difficulties that small business is facing, exactly what is the Government doing? What has the Government done? I have already said that it has done very little, although I ought to say that changes in the arrangements for company tax collection were recently announced by the new Treasurer (Mr Kerin). Dare we expect perhaps a change of direction in response to small business with the new Treasurer? The recently announced changes in the arrangements for company tax collection are welcome but they are very small recognition of the current crisis which is being faced by small business in Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is a need for a completely new tax mix. The range of taxes and charges on small business continues to bleed them dry. The goods and services tax proposal has been welcomed by small business associations because they recognise what the Government is unable to recognise-that is, that the wholesale sales tax system is not only inequitable but also it affects our ability to compete internationally.
       </para>
       <para>
        Some taxes which are particularly objectionable to small business are those that are imposed by States. I speak of payroll tax and land tax. Both of these need to be reviewed in the context of a whole new approach to taxation within this country. The Goss Labor Government in Queensland is doing its best to join in what the Federal Government is doing in finishing off small businesses with recent increases in land tax. One reasonably small shopping centre in my electorate paid $25,000 in land tax in 1985; next year it expects the bill to be $315,000, which is an increase in seven years of over 1,000 per cent. The concern I have about this is not that the owner of the shopping centre-who may well, as a company or an individual, be wealthy-has the expense of this tax, but the fact that all of this expense is passed back directly to the tenants of that particular shopping centre, all of whom are small business people.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Beddall report deals with a number of matters affecting small business tenants. It calls for a review of section 52a of the Trade Practices Act. I understand that the Trade Practices Commission is carrying out that review and I will be very interested to see what it has to say. There are a range of other matters of concern to tenants which were addressed by the Beddall committee.
       </para>
       <para>
        Most small businessmen are tenants. It seems to me that, in many respects, the Government's response to small business tenants is an unwillingness to offend its big business mates. They will go to great lengths to protect the interests of people such as Abeles and the Bonds and the Murdochs, but they seem to have very little regard for the small business community.
       </para>
       <para>
        We saw recently the imposition of the training guarantee levy and its effect on small business. Essentially, this is another tax as far as most small businesses are concerned. At the end of the financial year, most small businesses are flying blind and trying to find out what legitimate training activities are. We are talking mainly about small businesses. They could have as few as eight employees who will be liable for this training guarantee tax. As I have said before on a number of occasions in this House, the training requirements that are imposed on small business under that legislation are in many ways inappropriate.
       </para>
       <para>
        The annual report on small business, in the chapter titled `Reforming the Small Business Environment' refers to government purchasing:
       </para>
       <para>
        It is important that small business in Australia is given the opportunity to participate more fully in Australian Government purchasing opportunities.
       </para>
       <para>
        I thought that was interesting because I recently had another case in my electorate of a company called Eracom Pty Ltd, which deals in data system security. It employs a considerable number of people and is a very active exporter. Yet recently that company was forced to decline to renew a contract with the Australian Government because the Department of Administrative Services required it to agree to unlimited liability terms. In other words, the Government required this small business to be responsible for any equipment breakdown up to an amount of $25m or five times the amount payable by the customer under the contract, whichever was greater. Small business cannot accept that imposition.

       Doctors: Direct Billing

        <para in-line="1">
         â€”I rise today to grieve for the health of all Australians, given that the Australian Medical Association (AMA) has again launched an attack on direct billing. One really wonders, when we hear about difficulties in small business and other issues, what kind of management and what kind of training people within the AMA have in terms of their business procedures and practices.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        In terms of taxpayers' money, and in terms of waste and inefficiency which we hear talked about so much by members of Opposition, direct billing is the most efficient use of taxpayers' money. A doctor who direct bills costs the Australian taxpayer 30c in administrative charges. The administration required by the Health Insurance Commission for a doctor who does not direct bill costs $1.70. Therefore, it is costing Australian taxpayers $1.40 for every hospital visit-money which could well be spent on public health.
       </para>
       <para>
        Indeed, last weekend we received calls from the Mater Misericordia Hospital in Brisbane asking for the drugs which make premature babies' lives better to be more heavily funded. The current cost of those drugs is $1,600 per week for premature babies. These drugs have been proven to provide children with fewer disabilities and, in fact, fewer respiratory tract problems.
       </para>
       <para>
        If 1,000 people went to a doctor who direct bills instead of one who does not, the associated saving could provide for one of those babies. Why then are the AMA and very many people within the medical profession embarking on an absolute campaign to stop direct billing? It is quite an extraordinary practice. Is this because they care about people's health? Do they believe that if people pay $75 to visit a doctor-as they have done in New Zealand as a result of the conservative Government's dismantling of the national health program when it came to power-they will get a better service and will go more often? Alternatively, is their concern that of 57 per cent of our doctors-to provide a real health service to everybody, irrespective of how much money they have, through direct billing, thus providing a very efficient service while saving taxpayers' money?
       </para>
       <para>
        Think of the kinds of things we could do if this $1.40 per visit to the doctor was saved and such funds channelled into our public health system. We hear much about the cost of public health; we hear about the waiting lists at public hospitals; we hear about the demands on the system by our ageing population, the demands of very many people for replacement joints and so on; and we hear about the demands the new technology imposes upon the medical system.
       </para>
       <para>
        Indeed, all of us are entitled and have a right to the very best of treatment and to the most up-to-date and modern technological advances. But, of course, this costs money and it must come from the community. We as a community and as a Government are committed to that. The process of direct billing gives everybody equal access to medical treatment, irrespective of the amount of money they have.
       </para>
       <para>
        However, I might point out that some suburbs-indeed, a whole area of 20,000 people in my electorate-have no doctor who direct bills other than for pensioners and others `at their discretion', as they like to say. What kind of discretion is used when a doctor decides to direct bill some and not others? Is it because these people look poorer, are poorer, seem poorer? Who is the doctor to decide the socio-economic state of various patients before deciding whether to direct bill?
       </para>
       <para>
        It is quite an extraordinary situation. Are we to rush around in the middle of the night when children get sick-as inevitably they seem to do-to find automatic tellers to get cash money to pay such doctors? Extraordinary demands are made on people. What actually is the driving force behind the AMA and the numbers of doctors who will not direct bill? I am at a loss to find out.
       </para>
       <para>
        Recently within my electorate I published an information booklet for my constituents to give them some idea of the kinds of costs they will incur on visiting various doctors within the electorate. The representative from the AMA within the area rang me and complained. I asked him what his complaint was and whether he believed that people were not entitled to such information. He said that he did not know about that and that people should take other things into consideration when choosing a doctor. Indeed, there are other things which people take into consideration when choosing a doctor, but surely as an individual, a taxpayer and, of course, as a parliamentary representative, I am entitled to give, and my electorate is entitled to receive and have access to, information which is, and should be, freely available.
       </para>
       <para>
        The difficulty is, of course, that electricians, plumbers and all manner of other people publish their service costs-we know how much it will cost. We know what the call-out charges for a plumber, a television repairman and a washing machine repairman will be when we ring up-they tell us. We know automatically what we will be charged by any of those people who come to do tasks at our home and we make a choice appropriately. However, when it comes to sickness, very many in the medical profession believe that people should not be able to make the same sort of choice or, in fact, have that kind of information. Many in the medical profession believe that they have proprietorial rights over such information and that they are the only people who should have any of this information.
       </para>
       <para>
        We will continue to give out such information and we will continue to ensure that people know, and are able to make a choice, about the doctors within their own community. If they happen to choose people who direct bill and whom they like, then that is the way things are going to be. My own doctor told me that he cannot understand why in any kind of management process a doctor would choose not to direct bill because there are no bad debts, no difficulties and no problems. People simply come in, visit their doctor and receive the appropriate treatment and care. There is no question of a whole range of invoices and so on. The Government is billed and the cheque arrives within a matter of days. There is no problem for the doctor. Quite simply, at a time when the rest of the community and the rest of Australia is looking at efficiency, at leaner, meaner organisations in industry, government, management and so on, why is it that doctors want to charge taxpayers an extra $1.40 to process Medicare arrangements which they may or may not choose to operate? It seems an extraordinary waste and if, in fact, those doctors were concerned about public health and ensuring that we get our full money's worth for public health they would not be wasting this sort of money on the administration of their charging.
       </para>
       <para>
        Charging practices are quite extraordinary. Within my electorate some doctors charge up to $35 for a short visit, whereas others charge the scheduled fee under the direct billing arrangements and others charge somewhere in the middle. What is the difference? Do some have flasher surgeries? Do those doctors believe that some people are able to pay more than others? Or is it quite simply that some doctors believe that only certain people-those people with money-are entitled to health?
       </para>
       <para>
        As a Government, we are committed to Medicare and to direct billing. The community, of course, is beginning to vote with its feet. The medical centres and medical services that direct bill and provide better services and a range of services across the health board have very many patients who rely on them and who view the kind of service which they give as absolutely the best. We as taxpayers should be looking at this and asking why we are letting an organisation such as the AMA waste $1.40 every time somebody visits its doctors simply because they will not direct bill.

         â€”The long awaited report by Mr Tony Fitzgerald, QC, into the conservation, management and use of Fraser Island and the Great Sandy Region, which was released last month, has been greeted by the people of the region with stunned dismay. As time passes, the shock has turned to disappointment, opposition, anger, frustration and great anxiety about what the future may hold.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The report contains some 76 recommendations dealing with the region which, in substance, would mean an end to timber harvesting by the end of this year, the declaration of the whole of Fraser Island and surrounding seas and some mainland areas totalling 844,000 hectares as a regional park, and nomination for World Heritage listing. The report calls for the development of a series of detailed management plans by the end of next year and proposes seeking out Aboriginals whose ancestors may have been on Fraser Island to entrust them with the spiritual responsibility for the area and some role in the management.
       </para>
       <para>
        The use and management of Fraser Island has been an issue of public controversy for two decades. There have been a number of inquiries in the past, each of which were supposed to resolve the issue for all time, including a Federal Government sponsored commission of inquiry in 1975-76 which led the Fraser coalition Government to remove export permits for mineral sands mined on the island. However, the conservation movement has always demanded more and refused to accept these independent assessments of the issues and the evidence.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Australian Labor Party has always been hopelessly divided on the issue. Prior to the 1989 State election the Labor Party official policy declared that the whole of Fraser Island and the Great Sandy Region would be declared a national park. However, the Labor Party candidates for the affected electorates were strongly pro-logging and Wayne Goss publicly endorsed their position that Labor would not seek to phase out logging on Fraser Island. Labor subsequently won both Fraser Island electorates by very narrow margins-a mere 23 votes in Isis, and in Maryborough, Bob Dollin, a timber-cutter and sawmiller himself, was elected as the new member. Apparently in an endeavour to extract itself from its contradictory positions, the Queensland Government commissioned Mr Tony Fitzgerald to inquire once again into the future of the Fraser Island and the Great Sandy Region.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Commission's terms of reference included not only an examination of the future use of Fraser Island and the Great Sandy Region, but also the more general question of establishing principles and procedures for the orderly resolution of disputes over environmental or cultural issues. However, Fitzgerald was an unsuitable person to conduct any so-called independent inquiry into controversial conservation issues. He has long been identified with Labor Party causes and part way through the inquiry he was appointed by the Labor Government as Chairman of the Australian Heritage Commission. Even if Mr Fitzgerald felt he could conduct an independent inquiry at the time of his appointment, when he became Chairman of the Australian Heritage Commission with a salary of $28,577 he should have known, as a former judge, that he had an obligation to disqualify himself from the Fraser Island inquiry.
       </para>
       <para>
        The inquiry itself took 14 months, cost $2m and was a strange mixture of judicial-type hearings and a kangaroo court. In all, 544 submissions were received and the Commission conducted some public hearings and inspections. The conservation groups almost always failed to meet the Commission's deadlines and were regularly granted extensions of time. They used these extensions to peruse other submissions which were in on time to attempt rebuttal. The Federal Government was not involved in the inquiry, but the Department of the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories quietly gave $11,324 in a special grant to assist the conservation groups in the preparation of their submissions. Subsequent requests for Commonwealth assistance in the preparation of submissions by other community groups were refused.
       </para>
       <para>
        Despite the very generous treatment handed out by Fitzgerald to the conservation groups, midway through the inquiry process the radical groups, including the Fraser Island Defenders Organisation, walked out claiming they would not consider themselves bound by the inquiry's findings. They preferred to organise sporadic and sometimes violent demonstrations whenever any media organisation was prepared to observe.
       </para>
       <para>
        Fitzgerald did not produce any interim or draft report and those who were following the inquiry were of the view that the evidence being presented to the Commission was overwhelmingly against the radical conservationists' cause. The report is in some four volumes but, in the Fitzgerald style, it is vague and uncertain. The recommendations are open to vast interpretations. Fitzgerald himself discounts the value of the report right at the beginning when he says:
       </para>
       <para>
        Action which might adversely affect any property or other rights protected or recognised by law should not be taken solely on the basis of this report, before persons who are potentially affected are permitted a further opportunity to be heard with respect to their particular interests.
       </para>
       <para>
        Despite all of the uncertainty and anxiety, Tony Fitzgerald has refused to explain or answer any questions about the content of his report. No-one seems to be willing or able to provide any answers and if the north Queensland rainforest is any example, the Hervey Bay-Maryborough-Cooloola region can look forward to a long period of uncertainty and indecision. A decade of not knowing what is going to happen could well have a more devastating effect on the economy of the region than the loss of the timber industry, losses to the fishing industry, losses to the tourism industry and whatever other impact is associated with locking the area away.
       </para>
       <para>
        Hervey Bay is the fastest growing local authority region in Australia, yet I have already been told of major projects in the region being put on hold following the Fitzgerald report. Unemployment is already above double the national average and the region can ill afford to lose significant industries.
       </para>
       <para>
        The impact will be felt across the nation, as Fitzgerald has given a new stamp of approval to radical conservation claims. His recommendation to provide a role for Aboriginal people in the management of Fraser Island also breaks new ground and could further extend the claims of extremist land rights activists. Fitzgerald seems to acknowledge that there are no valid Aboriginal land rights claims to Fraser Island. The senior elder of the Budjilla-Butchella people, Mrs Olga Miller, has made that quite clear publicly. Yet Fitzgerald recommends seeking out Aboriginal people, wherever they may be, who claim some spiritual affiliation with any part of the region with a view to giving them primary spiritual responsibility and a role in the management of the region.
       </para>
       <para>
        Most of Fraser Island and the area proposed for World Heritage listing is national park or State forest, but there is some freehold and leasehold tenure, including the whole of the attractive and modern town of Rainbow Beach, which has justifiable ambitions to future city status. Are we going to have a World Heritage listed city or is its growth to be strangled? Many of the locals ask why we want World Heritage listing anyway. Management plans for Fraser Island have been in place for years. Do we need Bulgaria, Cuba, Peru or Yemen to tell us what to do, or is this another land grab by the Commonwealth at the expense of the States?
       </para>
       <para>
        The first direct effects of the Fitzgerald report on the Maryborough-Hervey Bay-Cooloola region will be the cessation of timber harvesting from Fraser Island and environs. Sawmills and timber processing industries will close with a loss of up to 200 jobs. The commercial fishing industry also seems certain to be adversely affected, with up to 300 jobs at stake depending on how severely fishing restrictions are imposed.
       </para>
       <para>
        Some Ministers are saying that tourism will boom as a result of World Heritage listing. However, the facts are that in other similar World Heritage listed areas in Australia the number of visitors has declined. In the case of Fraser Island, the area is already well known internationally and adding it to the 339 properties already on the World Heritage List will do nothing to boost its identity.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Fitzgerald report clearly recommends compensation for all of those whose rights or values are adversely affected by the implementation of the report. But how much and how lasting will the compensation be? It is difficult to identify a single job that currently exists in the region as a result of the $10.5m compensation provided by the Fraser Government for the cessation of sandmining exports.
       </para>
       <para>
        The loss of sandmining is worth over $800m and the timber industry around $10m a year, forever. What amount would be appropriate as compensation for loss of tourism, restrictions on development and other inland activities, anxiety and the loss of recreational privileges? To fulfil this Fitzgerald recommendation, the Government needs to be talking about compensation of billions.

         â€”In the short time available to me today, I wish to raise some difficulties which appear to exist in the treatment of visitor's visa applicants from a number of countries in our region. As most members of this House would be aware, the granting of such visas is the responsibility of the overseas post. This is, in part, where the problem lies, because it is difficult for individual members of parliament to keep in touch with those posts and to ensure that their constituents and their families are being treated in the way that we think they should be.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        For instance, a significant percentage of my constituents originally came from the Indian subcontinent or from various parts of Asia and South East Asia. They have lived and worked in Australia for a number of years and are naturalised Australian citizens. Naturally, when special occasions arise for these families, it is considered appropriate to invite relatives from overseas to attend and join in the celebrations. Unfortunately, despite the proximity of Asia and India, or maybe because of it, visitors are finding it increasingly difficult to get their visas approved, even where it is obvious that they have a good job in their home country and have sought short term leave only to allow for their visit to Australia. Frequently, these people are single and have no family ties apart from the ones in Australia and a few back home in their countries of origin.
       </para>
       <para>
        The letters of rejection to these people cause a degree of insult to them and to their families in Australia, although that is not necessarily the intention. Such correspondence invariably implies, and sometimes explicitly states, that the visas are being refused because the Australian High Commission has judged the persons not to be genuine visitors in so far as they might be inclined to overstay in Australia and become illegal immigrants.
       </para>
       <para>
        I put it to the House that this statement could be made of almost anybody, because it is always difficult to judge a person's intentions. However, the implication causes great distress to the families in Australia, especially when the family occasion being celebrated is a wedding or a wedding anniversary of some significance and note, which other Australian families would invite their relatives to in similar circumstances. As a New Zealander, I am very fortunate that my family could come and visit me and they have done so but have never been inclined to stay. Some of my constituents are not in that privileged position.
       </para>
       <para>
        One couple, for instance, are celebrating their fiftieth wedding anniversary and the mother and a sister were duly invited and applied to visit Australia from India. Only the mother was issued with a visa; the daughter's application was refused. Such acts of Solomon are difficult to understand, let alone explain, and I believe they are most undesirable. It is difficult for any family to celebrate and enjoy the visit of one member of the family when, in fact, another member has been refused to attend the same celebration.
       </para>
       <para>
        Similarly, one family's daughter was getting married and some other members of the family were invited as guests and applied to visit Australia from Burma. A sister was permitted to come but not a brother.
       </para>
       <para>
        Another elderly couple have not seen their grand-daughter for 25 years and were extremely distressed when she and her husband were refused a visit from Malaysia. As I indicated in my letter to the Australian High Commission in Kuala Lumpur in that case, I am conscious that Australia's relations with Malaysia have been somewhat strained in recent times with allegations of racism being made in regional newspapers. I believe it can only enhance our country's image if young people such as these are able to witness the level of acceptance that their family has here in Australia. It is my considered view that this young couple and the others I have mentioned represent no risk of overstay and that their family in Australia would not countenance any such attempt to pervert Australian law in any event.
       </para>
       <para>
        I would contrast this situation with the ease with which young people from some selected countries such as the United Kingdom, Ireland, Japan, Netherlands and Canada, which have a reciprocal agreement with Australia, are able to attend Australia on working holidays of up to 12 months under a specific visa arrangement, although they are single and under 26 years of age. So I would put it to the House that this is a position we cannot allow to continue and encourage overseas posts to deal with these matters in a sensitive way so that families may be reunited on a temporary basis.

         â€”I draw the attention of this House to the tragic plight of Victorian families, especially in my growing electorate of Corinella. Honourable members may realise that Corinella is on the fringe of suburban development in Victoria and is suffering the great strains of this recession we had to have. This week the Kirner Government has made announcements which, I am sure, will embarrass the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice). Power, gas and water charges are to rise by 6 per cent in 1991-92, a cost of $166 to every family in my electorate. There is the reintroduction of a flat $70 a year registration fee for cars. One needs two cars to get around as there is no public transport in the area of Corinella. Commonwealth card holders and pensioners will be exempted. Commercial vehicle registrations are to rise by 15 per cent which will cost a further $20 for each family.

        Traffic fines across the board will rise 20 per cent, with most fines rising between $17 and $27. There is probably not one person in this House who has not broken a traffic rule of some sort in his time. I put to the House that it will be the ladies of the household, perhaps endeavouring to get their children to school on time, who will be charged this $27. There will not be any money to spend on households in the week that they get bills for $167 for minor misdemeanours. Where does the household budget stand there? This is atrocious. I have only covered half of what the Kirner Government will do. Up to 10,000 jobs will be lost; that will also affect my electorate of Corinella.

         â€”This week, Australia's two sugar refineries, CSR Ltd and Bundaberg Sugar Co. Ltd, turned down an order from the Philippines to supply 12,000 tonne of white refined sugar. That amounts to a conservative estimate of approximately $3,600,000 of lost revenue for cane farmers, for the business community and for Australia. The reason that they have not been able to supply the order is because the refining process in this country is a disgrace. It is a disgrace because of the over-regulation and protection that existed for so many years in Queensland under the former National Party Government and the inability of both CSR and Bundaberg Sugar to actually get out into the real world and find a market for the real sugars-the white sugars. It is unfortunate that farmers are paying the price, as is the community, because of this stupidity.

        If one looks further to the comments in the Senate made only today by one of the Laurel and Hardys of politics, big Ronny Boswell, one will find that he is still going on about high protection levels. While National Party members are still living in the past, we are missing out on a massive sugar market simply because of the over-regulation and stuffiness of the Queensland sugar industry that has been dominated for too long by CSR and Bundaberg Sugar.

        Last month in the other place the Opposition called on the Government to introduce immediately emergency educational assistance in the form of hardship provisions so that families excluded from Austudy by the assets test, but whose income had collapsed in the rural crisis, would not be forced to withdraw their children from education on financial grounds. Nothing has happened.
       </para>
       <para>
        The honourable member for Hinkler might be prepared to take up the challenge to persuade his party to offer those who are really underprivileged-rural families-access to tertiary education. The cry of the Government for a clever country is hollow indeed when rural families, because they are asset rich but cash poor, are unable to access tertiary education.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Opposition recognises that a review on Austudy is being undertaken. What we call for is the provision of hardship clauses in the Austudy Act while that review takes place. The honourable member for Hinkler's comments will be hollow indeed unless he is heard publicly backing us on this call.

        What about Senator Richardson? Who has he been hobnobbing with? The answer is John Roberts of Multiplex, the richest builder in Australia. Why was he hobnobbing with him?

         â€”Let me take the last part of the honourable gentleman's question first, about the reason for my position on Coronation Hill being something to do with some deal with the Left. That observation by the Leader of the Opposition is not insulting to me; I take that sort of thing in my stride. But it is insulting to the intelligence of any person who knows anything about the history of this country.

       <para>
        My position in regard to Aboriginality and the positions and beliefs of the Aboriginal people is something that has been well established over a long period. It goes back, as a matter of public record, to the period when I was President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions (ACTU), when, as I have said recently, I attempted to mobilise the industrial and political Labor movement of this country to stop the infringement by miners and explorers into Aboriginal territory in Noonkanbah and what the Aborigines regarded as a sacred site.
       </para>
       <para>
        With a record that goes back that far, I find it obviously not only insulting but also manifestly erroneous for the Leader of the Opposition to seek to identify the position I have adopted on this issue with some alleged deal with the Left. Of course, I repudiate such a position entirely.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is very strange for the Leader of the Opposition to raise this issue and purport to speak with any authority. In the Newcastle Herald of 17 May the Leader of the Opposition, with his profound knowledge, is reported to have said:
       </para>
       <para>
        If you know anything about Aboriginal heritage, Bula didn't exist 10 years ago.

        That is a despicable statement and it is one which is totally repudiated by the Resource Assessment Commission report.

I repeat what he had to say.

        What did the Resource Assessment Commission have to say about it, Mr Speaker? This is what it had to say about it, at paragraph 7.52:
       </para>
       <para>
        On the basis of an examination of the record from the late 1940s to the mid-1980s, the following points can be made:
       </para>
       <para>
        The concept of Sickness Country and multiple Bula sites dates back to the earliest records available (Arndt 1962, 1966).
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . . . . . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        The concern among Jawoyn people about potential harmful effects of mining near Bula sites, first noted by Arndt in the early 1950s, continued through subsequent decades.
       </para>
       <para>
        Bula is consistently portrayed as an unusually apocalyptic figure, by Aboriginal standards; focal sites are centres of danger and are attended by prohibitions on access and activity. Records of restrictions on access to Bula sites date back to Maddock's visits to the Conservation Zone area in 1964.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Resource Assessment Commission summed it up in paragraph 7.126, when it said:

       <para>
        The Bula tradition is not a modern invention.
       </para>

         â€”For example, the March industry statement included decisions to extend duty free entry to mineral processing equipment not made in Australia, and to provide tax deductibility for capital expenses incurred in the preparation of environmental impact statements. Those are decisions which are consistent with the attitude of this Government towards wanting to see mining developed in this country. But when we set up the Resource Assessment Commission to examine the attitude of the Aboriginal people in regard to this issue and when it came down with its finding, unequivocally, that mining would be against the beliefs of these people, in my judgment, and in the judgment of my Government, that was a decision to which we had to adhere.

        Finally, the Leader of the Opposition asked this question: `How could this Government make a decision on this issue which would be against the material and economic benefits of the Jawoyn people?'. This is an issue that the Resource Assessment Commission directed its attention to very specifically. I ask the Leader of the Opposition to note on that point what the Resource Assessment Commission report said. This is what was said after the Commission had been set up and investigated this very issue; this was the finding of the Resource Assessment Commission at paragraph 9.60:
       </para>
       <para>
        The senior Jawoyn men are aware that a no-mining decision will mean that they and other Aboriginal people will lose the economic benefits they would receive if mining were to proceed.

         â€”Simply, the results of this study are encouraging and reinforce the Government's forecast that the economy will steadily improve during the latter half of this year. Another study released today further reinforces that view. The Confederation of Australian Industry survey of industrial trends found:

        Manufacturers' expectations for the next six months show a significant improvement.
       </para>
       <para>
        It goes without saying that the Government maintains policies which will see expectations transformed into reality, and therefore the latest housing finance figures, seasonally adjusted, show an increase of some 21.4 per cent for April 1991 and thereby provide hard evidence of a recovery into the near future.
       </para>
       <para>
        These are very encouraging signs, but it remains the case that employment gains will, as before, tend to lag at general recovery. It is the Government's intention that we emerge with continued progress on inflation and on the current account, because the simple fact is that Australians do not want to see their efforts, their sacrifices and their hard work blown over by an unsustainable recovery. They want neither a Rum Corps recovery nor the flattened, scorched earth prescriptions of the Opposition. Rather, Australians understand that by first consolidating the gains of inflation we establish the basis for steady employment growth, steady investment in the traded goods sector, and continued production. That is why the Government will not consider measures that will compromise this long term strategy.

On this issue, the finding in the Resource Assessment Commission report, which Senator Collins profoundly agreed with in many respects, is, however, in its totality not one which agrees with the position that Senator Collins has advanced. I do not disguise that fact. But what I am confronted with is the fact that on 26 April 1990 I set out terms of reference for an inquiry by the Resource Assessment Commission. One of the terms of reference of the Resource Assessment Commission stated:
        </para>

       <para>
        The scope of the inquiry shall be to identify and to evaluate the options for the use of those resources, including an assessment of . . . the interests of Aboriginals affected by any potential mining development.

       <para>
        That was the specific term of reference which I, on behalf of the Government, gave to the Resource Assessment Commission, and that Resource Assessment Commission has brought down a report in terms of that requirement that I put upon it to make this inquiry.

       <para>
        I could take up the time of the House at great length by going to all the passages of the Resource Assessment Commission report in which it answers the inquiries we asked it to undertake. The fact is that in every respect the Commission makes it clear that to proceed with mining would constitute a desecration and be a sacrilegious intervention into an area of profound belief of this group of people. As far as I am concerned, when I have set up that report and got that response and am told that to allow mining would involve such a desecration, then that is a course of action with which I am not prepared to be associated.

It is, Mr Speaker, as I think you will appreciate, a comprehensive paper which demolishes the arguments in favour of a consumption tax. We on this side of the House welcome the paper as a considered addition to this important debate in this country. This paper from the Australian Catholic Social Welfare Commission shows the proposal in regard to a consumption tax for what it really is, and that is an attack on families, an attack on the poor, an attack on the aged.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Some of the more salient points that are made in the paper include the following:
       </para>
       <para>
        Shifting from income tax to a GST would increase tax burdens for low income earners and families, both urban and rural. Low income earners and families have no choice but to spend more of their incomes on basic necessities of life.
       </para>
       <para>
        It went on:
       </para>
       <para>
        There appear to be no serious proposals to compensate retirees and others for losses in the value of their accumulated savings caused by price rises associated with the shift from income tax to GST.
       </para>
       <para>
        Next:
       </para>
       <para>
        A GST tends to create horizontal inequity by increasing the relative tax burdens of taxpayers supporting families.
       </para>
       <para>
        Finally it said in this respect:
       </para>
       <para>
        There is a widespread fear that indirect, less visible taxes will be preferred to more obvious taxes and used to raise the total tax burden. Such a concern is justified by experience both in Australia and overseas.
       </para>
       <para>
        The consumption tax proposal which is being put forward by the Opposition is a blatant attack on the living standards of those with the lowest capacity to pay-the aged, families and the poor. This discussion paper by the Australian Catholic Social Welfare Commission illustrates this point clearly. Yet despite the legitimate community concern on this issue, which has now been heightened by this paper put out by the Australian Catholic Social Welfare Commission, members of the Opposition refuse to announce the details of their policy. They refuse to say how they will compensate retirees for the lost value of their savings.

         â€”I am well aware of the honourable member's concern about issues of urban development and urban planning. The report referred to by the honourable member that was tabled yesterday is the second report from the Indicative Planning Council since the Special Premiers Conference to deal with questions of housing and land. This report deals particularly with the problems of assembling land in Australian cities. As the honourable member for North Sydney suggested, that is a particularly sharp problem for Sydney. Indeed, the Indicative Planing Council makes the point in relation to the supply of residential land in the city of Sydney that there is likely to be, at worst, a critical situation within 12 months whereby there simply will not be prepared land available for housing in that city. I hope that point which has been made by the Indicative Planning Council will send shock waves to the New South Wales Government about the concerns it has for housing and planning. For a government to fail to ensure that there are appropriate stocks of residential land available in a city which is subject to the pressures of Sydney, I believe, is a very parlous situation indeed. We emphasise that this is the responsibility of State governments.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        There are a number of proposals made in this report on which we hope to get the agreement of the States. They would provide the basis of very substantial reforms in November. As members of this House will know, an incredible mismatch exists within this country relating to the demographic character of the population and the nature of housing. Something like 80 per cent of houses in Australia are on separate detached blocks of land, whereas the number of families with dependent children needing that type of housing is of the order of 25 to 30 per cent of the Australian population. As the Indicative Planning Council points out, there is an urgent need to develop policies of urban consolidation which make more effective use of infrastructure.
       </para>
       <para>
        If we are going to go down that track it will require the cooperation of three levels of government. Indeed, local government in North Sydney could play an important role in that respect. It will need access to data, which means that for the first time in Australia we are able to make decisions about housing and planning on current data. At the moment the Indicative Planning Council has to wait more than 12 months to get a picture of the position of available land. It will need certain approaches to building regulations-my predecessor Mr Crean is especially concerned to achieve reform there-and a degree of flexibility that has not been seen before. There has to be different approaches on the part of local government.
       </para>
       <para>
        I believe that the honourable member's question is very important. The issues raised by the Indicative Planning Council are not, at this stage, merely urgent; they are absolutely essential. The Commonwealth Government is anxious to see them tackled through the housing and planning conference later this year. We hope that we can make substantial progress at the Special Premiers Conference in November.
       </para>
       <para>
        I thank the honourable member for his question. I share his concerns. I hope to see, in cooperation with the New South Wales Government, decisions made that would address the problems in Sydney which have needed addressing for a considerable period.

The new disability reform package replaces the invalid pension on 1 October 1991.

         â€”I am aware of the concern raised by the honourable member for Richmond about people with disabilities. I am also aware that he, as have other members of the Parliament, has received representations concerning the changes in the invalid pension system which comes into effect from October this year. This is essentially to change the philosophy that exists within the invalid pension to a much more positive philosophy than that implied in the test which, until 1 October, has emphasised the need for people to establish 85 per cent permanent incapacity before they become eligible for a pension. I cannot think of any statement about a person that is more negative than a statement which suggests that somehow a degree of incapacity has to be proved before he is eligible for a government payment. It puts all the emphasis on the disability and none of the emphasis on ability.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The way that the invalid pension system or the new income support system is to be reformed is to remove that classification of permanent incapacity for work and to move to a position which puts more emphasis on people's potential. It introduces a minimum impairment threshold of 20 per cent together with a reduced range of non-medical factors and a target payment to those with significant disabilities. It requires people assessed as being able to benefit from rehabilitation and training to undertake appropriate activities as a condition of pension entitlement.
       </para>
       <para>
        Through labour market programs, the Government in the last Budget significantly expanded the opportunities available to people with disabilities. As a result of the change in the philosophy of the invalid pension, in combination with the labour market opportunities, we expect to see an increase in the number of people with disabilities moving into work on a part time or full time basis. Let me emphasise that there is no compulsion involved in the change, but where people feel they can benefit from that opportunity every encouragement will be built into the new system.
       </para>
       <para>
        In conclusion, this approach-thought through and developed in terms of policy, optimistic in terms of what is possible for people, built by a very strong resource commitment in terms of labour market programs-is to be contrasted with the policy advanced by the Opposition in the last election campaign, a policy which is still current, where tens of thousands of people would be removed arbitrarily from sickness benefit and invalid pension with no reference to the need to make a greater positive commitment in terms of labour market opportunities.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Opposition's policy involves arbitrary cuts and is insensitive and not thought through, as opposed to our thought-through approach, based on the Cass Review of Social Security, now to be implemented, according to timetable, in October, which will lead to a quite dramatic change in the attitudes of people with disabilities towards themselves, as well as a commitment on behalf of the Australian people to social justice for people with disabilities.

The mining industry has attempted to put the community in a position of believing that in refusing to go ahead with mining at Coronation Hill we are really stopping some giant bonanza, putting the whole industry--

         â€”We all know of the long and deep interest which the honourable member has in the subject which is the topic of his question of me. Let me say, and I hope this is a view which is shared by everyone in this House, that the repeal of the Population Registration Act marks a profound change in South Africa, and I think the honourable member will recognise that. The importance of this is to be understood by realising that, as a result of this repeal, South Africans will no longer be assigned, as they have been, at birth to a racial category determining every aspect of their lives. That is what has been the case under this Act, and by its repeal that comes to an end. Of course, by the operation of that Act up until this time, by its very nature, that denied equality of opportunity to the vast majority of South African citizens.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The repeal of this Act, the last of the three principal legislative pillars of apartheid, does fulfil the promises on this issue made by President de Klerk in his speech opening the South African Parliament in February this year. I unequivocally congratulate the President and his Government on this great achievement, for a great achievement it is in fact.
       </para>
       <para>
        Having said that, we have to understand that this is not the end of apartheid. Important as it is-and we congratulate the Government-it is not the end of apartheid. South Africa's Constitution still denies the vote, on racial grounds, to the vast majority of its people. A new non-racial South Africa will come about only under a new non-racial constitution, so the development of such a non-racial constitution is the next great challenge in the regeneration of South Africa.
       </para>
       <para>
        As honourable members would know, we have taken a lead internationally in arguing that the major reforms now under way in South Africa require a positive response from the world community, including the phased lifting of sanctions as the South African Government meets its reform commitments. But equally it is clear that to remove all sanctions now while the majority of South Africans are denied a vote would be to abandon the principles upon which we have acted, in concert with almost every other nation in the world, over many decades.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is interesting to note that the Opposition says that we should drop all sanctions immediately, but it was saying that five years ago. It has the cheek to say that our policy has not responded to changes in South Africa. The Opposition's policy is the one which has never changed; it has been business as usual, apartheid or not, as far as the Opposition in this country is concerned. It is not surprising that the Opposition does not understand now the need to maintain some sanctions, because it has never understood the reason for imposing sanctions in the first place. The Opposition has no credentials on this issue whatsoever. I notice that the Opposition has accused us of being emotionally committed to the African National Congress (ANC).

        Lastly, the Opposition has criticised this Government's efforts to help ensure that a new non-racial South Africa will have the economic skills to realise its great potential. Nothing could more clearly show the hypocrisy of those opposed to sanctions, opposed for years on the grounds that if we had sanctions there this would harm the South African economy. Yet when this Government takes direct action to try to ensure that in this emerging new non-apartheid South Africa those who will be in positions of power and responsibility will be well equipped to undertake and discharge their economic responsibilities, when we make a modest attempt to ensure that they will be in place to handle that great responsibility, we are attacked for that.
       </para>
       <para>
        As far as we are concerned, the position on this side of the House has been one of consistent principle. When there was apartheid in place we took the lead within the Commonwealth to ensure that that dastardly system would be brought to an end. As the Government of South Africa has come to its senses, largely as a result of the pressure that has been applied to it under the lead by Australia and other like-minded countries, we have been among the first to congratulate it, to recognise those changes and to say that we have a corresponding responsibility to take the lead in a measured and responsible way in starting the move to lift sanctions.
       </para>
       <para>
        We believe also that we have a responsibility at this stage to those in the new South Africa who will have the great responsibility of trying to guide that new nation through a great shoal of economic problems to start to help to train them-even before they get that responsibility-in South Africa and here as far as we can to ensure that they will be as well placed as possible to meet that great responsibility. We are proud of what we are doing in that respect.

        In the light of these considerations, the Inquiry reaffirms its views that there are sound reasons for treating the Conservation Zone as a special case. It understands that the mining and business sectors have great difficulty in accepting this view but it believes the facts show that particularly sensitive issues are involved and that these issues deserve full consideration before the Government makes its decisions.

We are not going to be having resource assessment commissions set up to deal with all the sorts of other considerations and circumstances that the honourable member is talking about. We did it here. As far as all the other ventures that he is talking about are concerned, there will not be any Resource Assessment Commission approach; there will be available to anyone who wants to use them the existing legislative provisions and processes-nothing more, nothing less.

         â€”My attention has been drawn to the point raised by the honourable member for Port Adelaide-that is, the significant expansion in automobile exports that have both occurred and are expected this year. The important thing for all members of the House to note is that this is part of a much broader expansion of exports in the manufacturing industry-an interesting diversification of our exports away from our continuing great dependence on commodity exports. The figure for the last nine months between July 1990 and April 1991 for exports of manufactured products, leaving out metals, reached $7.6 billion. This is a 23 per cent increase in that period in those manufactured products.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I want to pick out a few of the major areas because these increases have occurred across all of the major areas of manufacturing industry. If we take road vehicles, which have just been mentioned, the exports rose in those two nine-month periods from $396m to $612m-a 55 per cent increase. It is expected that over the course of this calendar year that figure will rise to over $1 billion. There has been an expansion of chemicals from $904m to $1,012m a 12 per cent increase. Machinery exports have risen from $1.8 billion to $2.3 billion, a 26 per cent increase.
       </para>
       <para>
        We should particularly look at some of the finer details-some of the high-tech areas of manufacturing-and compare them for the two same nine-month periods. Taking office machines and automatic data processing equipment, there has been a 30 per cent increase from $400m to $523m; telecommunications equipment has increased from $179m to $243m, a 36 per cent increase; and pharmaceuticals and medical products have increased from $190m to $224m, an 18 per cent increase.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is a long, hard and difficult task to shift the diversification of our exports so that we become less dependent on commodities. This is hard evidence that that shift is taking place. All honourable members in this House should welcome this movement because it is imperative to the economic recovery of this country.

         â€”I will answer that question, as it is my area of responsibility. I would like to explain the processes that have already been followed before I outline to the House the decision I made in respect of this issue. The proponents' community consultation program began in October 1989 and ran into December 1990. The program commenced prior to the release of the draft environmental impact statement (EIS) on the third runway and was undertaken specifically to promote awareness and to encourage interested members of the community to express their views about the project.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Community responses were received from individuals and from interested groups, and the comments were taken into account when preparing the draft EIS. My Department then released the draft guidelines for the EIS for public review from 26 August to 23 September 1989. Comments received were taken into account when preparing the final guidelines forwarded to the Federal Airports Corporation (FAC) for the preparation of the draft environmental assessment on the runway proposal.
       </para>
       <para>
        Once prepared, the draft environmental assessment was released for public review for over three months from September 1990. Some 1,897 submissions were received and these have been sent to the Federal Airports Corporation so it can take them into account when preparing the final environmental assessment. A further component of public participation was conducted on 22-23 April this year when consultations were conducted between my Department, the Federal Airports Corporation and these community groups. I have received a report of the meetings and have determined that the matters raised in the report should be taken into account by the Federal Airports Corporation when it prepares the final environmental assessment.
       </para>
       <para>
        I believe that the community consultations were useful and dealt with the main issues of concern to community organisations, but I do not believe it is desirable to prolong the process with any further meetings. I am not convinced that anything will be gained by a public inquiry into the runway proposal; as I have outlined in some detail, extensive consultations have taken place with the public and the public have had every opportunity to make their views known. I do not believe an inquiry would raise any new issues or assist the Government to make a decision on this matter; therefore, that matter is closed.

         â€”I thank the honourable member for this question, and report to the House that the Cairns Group will be meeting in Manaus, Brazil, on 8-9 July. This will be the first Cairns Group meeting held since the failure of the Brussels meeting of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) in December. It will take place, and has been timed to take place, in advance of the Group of Seven summit. It will provide the Cairns Group with the opportunity to consider ways in which it can keep up the pressure on the agricultural negotiations and it will reinforce to other participants the Group's determination to pursue a significant result from the Uruguay Round.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The technical discussions on agriculture have been going on in Geneva over the past several months and we expect a paper from the GATT Director-General, Arthur Dunkel, who has been chairing these discussions, which will attempt to narrow down the negotiating options within the next week. The European Community is also expected to float a number of suggestions for internal agricultural reform during July. Indeed we are still waiting for the European Community, as we have been for the past 4 1/2 years, before any serious negotiation can begin on agriculture. We look forward to the proposals that hopefully it will make in July. All these issues will be taken up at the Manaus meeting.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Cairns Group has been an effective third voice in the negotiations. It is very much determined to maintain that role. I would make one further point: despite some accusations and claims to the contrary, the Group has shown flexibility and realism in its approach, and it is about time some of the other negotiating partners responded to that. We will not be swayed by other countries' criticism to lower our expectations, because we cannot have a successful outcome to this round unless we have a significant result in agriculture.

         â€”The decision by this Government on Coronation Hill gives this Government and the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) a clear, unmistakable smell of political death. As the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Reith) said earlier, the Prime Minister is the political swinging carcass. He is a lame duck Prime Minister who ignores the fact that Australia has 800,000 unemployed people at this time; who ignores the fact that the foreign debt has increased five-fold since he became Prime Minister of this country; and who ignores the job implications and all the other implications flowing from this failure to respond to the litmus test. Clearly, the Prime Minister is finished and this Government is finished; it is now only a matter of time.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        There does come a time in the life of a government-and those of us who have been in politics for a while recognise the signs-when it is incapable of taking decisions in the national interest. There comes a time in the life of a government when its store of goodwill in the community runs out. People lose faith in a government when it becomes unpredictable, irrational, indulgent and, frankly, in this case, incompetent.
       </para>
       <para>
        Since the last elections there have been clear signs, but in my view the decision on Coronation Hill is the clearest signal to the community at large-a community hurting greatly from the economic recession we had to have, a community where so many people have lost their jobs and where in so many families the part time work enjoyed by the spouse has collapsed to only one or two hours a week or has been wiped out completely.
       </para>
       <para>
        Across Australia today there is a degree of economic agony, economic hurt, not yet realised by this Federal Cabinet or this Federal Government. It is a watershed for this Government, a watershed for this Prime Minister. They have failed the test in relation to Coronation Hill. To use a colloquialism, there have been too many `Hawkie Porkies'-too many deals, and too many of them under the table.
       </para>
       <para>
        I can do no better than quote the Treasurer (Mr Kerin), who said that Coronation Hill was a `totem issue' for Australian business in its relationship with the Government. On this one occasion, the Treasurer was right: it was a totem issue. But the Treasurer, the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths) and the economic Ministers of the Cabinet were comprehensively rolled. All Australians will suffer, directly and indirectly. The standard of living of all Aboriginal Australians will suffer.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Minister for Resources has often spoken of particular needs in relation to Coronation Hill. On 5 October 1989 he told the House:
       </para>
       <para>
        In my view, providing the environmental safeguards can be satisfied and the legal rights of the Aboriginal people in that area can be accommodated, Coronation Hill ought to proceed. The driving force for that is, in part, our current account difficulties. My main motivation for coming to that decision is that I am confident that the trade-off, the balance, between environmental considerations and development can be achieved.
       </para>
       <para>
        I believe that it will be achieved with the effluxion of time.
       </para>
       <para>
        There are many reasons-reasonable, sensible, constructive and non-emotional reasons-why the decision should have been to give the green light on Coronation Hill, not in the absolute terms that some people speak of, but in terms of allowing negotiations to proceed between the Jawoyn people and the joint venturers. My colleague the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge) will make this point very clearly. The responsible approach of the Liberal and National parties throughout the matter has been that as a next step negotiations should be allowed to proceed between the Jawoyn people and the joint venturers, Newcrest Australia Ltd, in relation to Coronation Hill so that mining might be renewed.
       </para>
       <para>
        I say to members of the public in the gallery and across Australia that in fact what we are talking about is not a green fields mining site, not a site that has never ever been touched before, but a hill at the wrong end of the Northern Territory which has had 25,000 tonnes of ore previously removed in the decade of the sixties. It is not a green fields site. Indeed, the Kakadu conservation zone has been mined in 12 separate locations including the 25,000 tonnes from Coronation Hill. On the economic statistics, there are some 630 jobs available through this project. There is ultimately some $500m of much needed export income to boost and help the economy of Australia to move back onto the rails in the interests of all Australians.
       </para>
       <para>
        But also-and I am interested to see the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly) sitting at the table-one of the products from Coronation Hill, in addition to the gold, is palladium, and another one is platinum. The Minister might like to tell the House why she is opposed to mining two products at one of the very few deposits Australia has of palladium and platinum which are so useful in the battle on the greenhouse front. As the Minister would well know-perhaps she does not-palladium and platinum are used in catalytic converters for cars to reduce their greenhouse emissions. So this Minister, whose portfolio includes the environment, has stopped the one major project which would have boosted the Australian supply of palladium and platinum. How dare she!
       </para>
       <para>
        Whether the Government likes it or not, Coronation Hill was a litmus test for the Government, and it has failed. That fact raises some interesting and curious precedents in its discussions and debates on this issue. Assuming that the Government wants to be seen as even-handed in fostering reconciliation between the Aboriginal people and the general Australian community, surely the Prime Minister is obligated to publicly support the wishes of the Jabiluka and Koongarra Aboriginal traditional owners who want to, in fact, proceed to develop uranium mines on their Aboriginal land. In other words, this Government cannot have it both ways.
       </para>
       <para>
        This Government must now respond within the next week in relation to the abolition of Labor's illogical three-mine uranium policy. The term `illogical' is not my term. It is the term that the Prime Minister used in response to the questions I have asked him on the floor of the House, the questions that the Leader of the Opposition has asked him on the floor of the House, and he is correct in that context: it is an illogical policy where some uranium is good and some uranium for a boundary fence is bad. That policy should be abolished; it must be abolished at the Hobart conference. If honourable members do not believe me on that particular aspect, I refer them to the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths) who said yesterday that a double negative, the wrong decision on Coronation Hill and the wrong decision or no decision on abolishing Labor's three-mine policy, would send a double negative signal around the world to Australia's disaster.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government is in an illogical, irrational, hopeless position. Contradictions abound; the national interest is submerged in internal party machinations; and the economy sinks further and further into recession. Who has led the Government to this hopeless position? It was the most hopeless, the most emotional, the most irrational member of Cabinet-none other than the Prime Minister himself, the lame-duck Prime Minister, the Prime Minister who has botched so much of his eight years of governance of this country, the Prime Minister who fails to show the real positive, courageous leadership required of him, the Prime Minister who now is so wedded to the left wing that he must jump this way on Coronation Hill, and it remains to be seen which way he will finally jump on uranium policy.
       </para>
       <para>
        I note with interest that the concerns about this issue are so great on the Government side of the House that honourable members cannot afford the luxury of another set of headlines in tomorrow morning's paper creating doubt about which way Caucus might go on a Friday morning, because we know what happened last time Caucus tried to hold a meeting on Friday morning. Honourable members will recall that it had the 8 a.m. meeting. That was a corker; that lasted all of about 11 minutes and there was total confusion. Then Caucus went back for the 10 a.m. meeting and half of its members had been told to get out of town fast so that the 10 a.m. meeting would not proceed. That was the last time Caucus tried to assemble on a Friday morning, so perhaps we can understand why they are not game enough to have a special meeting of Caucus on Friday morning, tomorrow morning, on Coronation Hill and that the Caucus meeting has now been brought forward to 6.45 tonight.
       </para>
       <para>
        I say to the House that it is a finely balanced decision in terms of the strengths of Caucus, and I say that the Government and the Caucus have failed Australia. The only way that can be reversed is if Caucus has the courage to make the decision which Treasurer Kerin knows to be right and which Minister Griffiths knows to be right and allows the green light on Coronation Hill, the green light for negotiations to proceed between the Jawoyn people and the joint venturers. The big loser from this decision is the Australian national interest. The big winner, sadly, very sadly, is the absent honourable member for Blaxland (Mr Keating) who is waiting in the wings while the Prime Minister performs slow-motion harikari.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let us look at the issue of the Aboriginals-and the honourable member for Chisholm (Dr Wooldridge) will do this in more detail. The decision of this side of the House, the decision of the shadow Cabinet and the decision of the vast majority of members of the Cabinet was to allow negotiations to proceed between Newcrest and the Jawoyn people. That is a responsible way forward. That is the correct way forward as a next step. That is all that is asked of this Cabinet, this Government, this Caucus, and yet they could not even cross that starting line.
       </para>
       <para>
        Australia in 1991 at the depths of a recession we had to have is in such a hopeless state under the leadership of this Prime Minister and this Government that we cannot even get the decision-making processes on key projects, on major projects, right-whether it is Coronation Hill or even the very fast train (VFT). The joint venture in terms of the VFT, for example, is at the point of collapse because it cannot even get the Government and the Treasury of this country to address some basic decisions so that it can get on with the evaluation of that particular project, which I know the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories is interested in.
       </para>
       <para>
        Enough of this vacuum of leadership. Enough of this lack of leadership. It is time that this Government and this Prime Minister departed the scene. It is time that the people had the chance to exercise their democratic rights in that regard.
       </para>
       <para>
        The approach we adopted recognises that the Jawoyn people have previously been in favour of mining. Two of the three custodians have previously indicated that position, and a number of Jawoyn people this day have still indicated that they are in favour of mining. The Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Collins) has in fact probably put the best perspective on the question of the Jawoyn people; we also have the very correct statement made on that issue by the honourable member for Chisholm:
       </para>
       <para>
        The Jawoyn people are simply-
       </para>
       <para>
        being used as-
       </para>
       <para>
        convenient cannon fodder for them in this battle-
       </para>
       <para>
        I think it is a very sad state of affairs that the Government has now agreed to go along that path using the Jawoyn people, who are entitled to have their beliefs respected, as simple cannon fodder. It is an absolute disgrace that we have reached this stage in a failed decision-making process with regard to this important and vital project.
       </para>
       <para>
        Finally, it is worthy to note the contents of a letter sent by this Prime Minister to Brian Loton, the then Managing Director of Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd, dated 9 October 1987. He said:
       </para>
       <para>
        I can assure you that there has been no change in government policy on the conservation zone concept or in relation to Coronation Hill.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government clearly has lost faith with the mining industry. This Government has lost faith with the business sector and with the people of Australia. This Government has lost faith with many in the Aboriginal community. This Government has lost faith with the Australian people because it has ceased to govern in the national interest. It has failed the test on Coronation Hill and, as a consequence, this Minister, the Prime Minister, should resign.

         â€”If we listened to the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer) we would have believed that all the economic problems in Australia could have been solved with one simple decision: to mine Coronation Hill. What a simplistic and stupid approach but, let me say, hardly an unpredictable one. In fact, the views of the Opposition have been made clear over the past few months while this inquiry was going on into the whole future of Coronation Hill.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Of course, the Opposition did not bother to wait for that report to come down. On 4 October the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) said:
       </para>
       <para>
        Coronation Hill has already been mined once and from an environmental viewpoint there is no convincing reason why it shouldn't be mined again.
       </para>
       <para>
        He also said on 17 May 1991:
       </para>
       <para>
        If you know anything about Aboriginal heritage-
       </para>
       <para>
        which obviously he does not-
       </para>
       <para>
        Bula didn't exist 10 years ago; he (Bula) suddenly emerged as a device to block Coronation Hill.
       </para>
       <para>
        That shows how much ignorance exists and how little the Opposition seriously wants to consider this issue. In fact, most of the speech by the Leader of the National Party (Mr Tim Fischer) did not even refer to Coronation Hill.
       </para>
       <para>
        I will explain to the House why we took the decision we did: we took it because we had had an umpire's decision handed down. We had been through a legitimate process by which we set up a Resource Assessment Commission (RAC), and we said to the Commission, `Would you give us a view, particularly in relation to the environmental aspects and the Aboriginal aspects of Coronation Hill?'.
       </para>
       <para>
        So this was a very transparent and consistent process. All interested parties had the right to put their point of view. It was an inquiry that was legitimately set up by this Parliament. There was a notification of the inquiry, there were calls for written submissions from members of the public and interested groups. That was all published. There were 199 written submissions received. The RAC conducted hearings. It received representative views. The miners had the chance to put their points of view; the Aboriginals put theirs. They had public meetings in Darwin, in the conservation zone in Kakadu, in Brisbane, Canberra and Sydney. There were major exhibits. They even had a toll free number that people could call to put their points of view. I am outlining this detail to the House only so that the House understands that when the Cabinet considered this issue it had in front of it the thousands of pages of transcript of evidence and a final report.
       </para>
       <para>
        The problem about all this is that the Opposition does not like the outcome of the report. That is the fundamental problem. What the Opposition says today is that we should keep negotiating with the Aboriginals, yet we have these thousands of pages, plus a final report, which say quite categorically what the Aboriginals' views are. On page 178 the report says:
       </para>
       <para>
        7.71 If a democratic approach were to be taken to the question of whether or not mining should proceed in the Conservation Zone, the evidence suggests that the majority of Jawoyn people would be opposed to mining activity anywhere in the Conservation Zone.

         â€”How do we know? The RAC has just done a year's investigation. How does the honourable member think we know? Whose view does the honourable member for McPherson accept-the view of the honourable member for Farrer or the view of the Commission that was set up, properly constituted, and brought down a report after speaking to the Aboriginal community and asking it for its point of view? That is a very radical step. The report goes on to say:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        In Aboriginal society, however, responsibility for religious sites and the authority to speak about them rests with the recognised custodians. In the case of the Zone the identity of the custodians is clear and they enjoy very widespread support in this role. The Inquiry believes that it has obtained as clear, as accurate, and as current an understanding of their views as can reasonably be obtained.
       </para>
       <para>
        Again, that was clearly that Coronation Hill and that area which is classified as Coronation Hill not be mined.
       </para>
       <para>
        On the one hand, Opposition members have criticised the Government because, they say, we have too many inquiries and we do not make decisions. The problem is that the only decisions that Opposition members want are the ones they agree with. In this case we have brought down a decision, and they say, `We don't like that decision; what you should have is further discussions with the Aboriginals'-when in fact the report quite clearly says that the Jawoyns' views are firmly that they should not have mining on that site, after a legitimate process of inquiry.
       </para>
       <para>
        So the basic problem that Opposition members have is that they do not accept the Aboriginals' point of view. They say, `Let's not accept that'. What would Opposition members have said had it been the other way around? If the Aboriginals had said they agreed with mining, would Opposition members have accepted the report then? Yes, of course they would have. The only reason they do not accept the findings of the report is that they do not like what it says, and they do not believe that the Aboriginals have a right to determine what goes on in that land. That is the fundamental problem-Opposition members do not believe in the traditions and the heritage of the Aboriginals. They do not believe in the value of Aboriginal culture. They talk about it, but when it comes to the tough decisions, they do not believe it, and they say that the Government is not prepared to take the tough decisions.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let me tell the House in relation to this matter that this is the tough decision. It is hard to stand up and say that we as a government actually support the right of the Aboriginals to espouse their own beliefs, that we are actually committed to their word in relation to their culture and their religion.

However, I am a Catholic, and I am happy to hold many Catholic beliefs which I am sure not everyone else in this House happen to hold. But I happen to believe in the Holy Trinity and the transubstantiation, because I happen to be a Catholic. But that does not mean that I impose that view on everybody else. On the other hand, I believe that all Australians, whether they are black or whether they are white, should have an opportunity to express those religious beliefs.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        When the inquiry commenced I did not know what the Aboriginals' view was in relation to that. So the Government asked; the Government found out; the Government acted on that. But of course the Opposition is not prepared to accept that view. Then the Opposition says, `All this is a sudden shock. Shock, horror! This Government is not going to allow mining in Coronation Hill, and that is the end of the world as we know it'.
       </para>
       <para>
        I believe-and this report indicates-that it is quite clear that this area of the conservation zone is a very special case. If people have been there they will know that this is a very special case. Why? It is not just because it combines the Aboriginal culture and heritage, which we have talked about, but also because of a number of other factors. First of all, it is surrounded by one of the great parks in the world-one of the great parks-about which there have been a number of inquiries that have found that the essential part of the protection of that area is the protection of the South Alligator River.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the RAC report it makes reference, of course, to the park and to its environmental aspects. The one thing it says about it is that we must ensure the integrity of Kakadu. Let me say as a politician standing in this House today that I would not be worthy of being here if I did anything to destroy Kakadu and its heritage for my kids and our grand kids. If we did that we should not be here in this Parliament; I should not be the Environment Minister; nor should I be elected by the people.
       </para>
       <para>
        Frankly, what we have done as a result of this decision is not just protect the Aboriginal culture, we have also ensured that for ever Kakadu National Park will remain intact as one of the great parks of this world. I am very proud of that and I am very proud of the Government's decision in relation to it. It was a hard decision, a very hard decision, and it was a decision that we took looking into the future. Politicians are often accused of being short-sighted, of only thinking in terms of the next election. Environment Ministers cannot afford to be like that, nor do I think can any government that really wants to stay there and make a lasting contribution.
       </para>
       <para>
        This decision is about the long term. It is about protecting that region forever. Tomorrow, with the support of the Caucus, the conservation zone will become part of the Kakadu National Park. It will come under my portfolio, and on 1 October this year I will be very proud to be submitting a World Heritage application for the whole of the Kakadu National Park. I believe that that will be accepted. By the end of next year the Kakadu National Park, incorporating the conservation zone, will become an area of World Heritage, of world significance that will never be able to be destroyed, that will be there into the future for all our kids. That is what this decision was all about, and it was made primarily thinking into the future, not just into the next election. It is a very special area.

         â€”`Come on', he says. I wonder if he has ever been there? I wonder if he has ever had that sense of understanding its link with the Kakadu and with our culture? The RAC report says that the conservation zone is linked ecologically with the Kakadu National Park, that it is an integral part of the ecology of the Kakadu National Park. It says:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Any mining development in the Zone would, from some perspectives, detract from the ecological integrity of the Zone and Kakadu National Park . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        We are going to ensure that that integrity remains intact. The Leader of the National Party was talking about the economic woes of the country, and we acknowledge those, but they will not all be solved by having one mine in the conservation zone. That point was acknowledged by the developer at Newcrest, John Quinn, who said on 13 May 1991:
       </para>
       <para>
        We contend that the RAC analysis is too narrow, but have never suggested that Coronation Hill, on the basis of present knowledge, is other than a modest scale mining operation.
       </para>
       <para>
        A modest scale, a very modest scale. The RAC goes on to give all the details about that. The RAC assesses `direct net economic benefits' of the Coronation Hill mine `to the Australian economy of approximately $82m'. If mining had been to proceed in accordance with guidelines put out by the RAC, however, this benefit would have been reduced to a value estimated by Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics of $63.9m.
       </para>
       <para>
        We cannot pass over that. That is a significant amount of money, but it is not going to be the end of the mining industry. Basically, it is a small mine. However, if the mining industry were considering exploration and development along the whole of the conservation zone, we may be looking at a different scenario. If one really gets to the crux of the issue, that is what it is all about. It is not just about Coronation Hill. It is about the exploration and development of the whole of the conservation zone. Imagine the impact that that would have on the Kakadu. The RAC report says that we could not even start to gauge the impact that would have. There is no doubt in my mind that that would be devastating.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let us look at the economic aspects. One is the economic aspects of tourism. I am also the tourism Minister in this portfolio. The Kakadu is one of the great tourist attractions of this country. Can honourable members imagine the damage it would do to our reputation in tourism if we said, `Okay, we are just going to get in and wreck that area'? That is what would have happened. The growth in tourism in the Kakadu is phenomenal. At the moment we get in 238,000 people a year. It is growing. The real growth in tourism is in the area of eco-tourism.
       </para>
       <para>
        The decision this Government has made on Coronation Hill is based on the overwhelming evidence that the effects of mining on the Jawoyn people and on the environment outweigh any economic benefits. We looked at the report. We got the evidence. We made a decision. We looked at the impact the decision would have on the Jawoyn people. We looked at the impact on the environment, and we made a decision-a tough decision but a decision that is the right decision, not just for today but for all the tomorrows and for all future generations of Australians.

         â€”The Coronation Hill debate was defined by the current Treasurer (Mr Kerin) when on 8 May he said in a matter of public importance:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The real issue involved in this Government's consideration of mining at Coronation Hill is: how is the national interest best advanced and what are the circumstances and conditions which guarantee the advancement of the national interest?
       </para>
       <para>
        He further went on:
       </para>
       <para>
        The national interest is best served by understanding, assessing and integrating all these considerations. A critical component in making a balanced, consistent and sensible decision . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        What did we get? We got a decision that was a sop to the left wing of the Labor Party, the worst sort of guilt politics, and a pathetic attempt to shore up a Prime Minister who is diminishing in stature daily. This follows on the lamentable and pathetic record of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) in Aboriginal affairs. I am pleased that he believes in Bula because I did not think he believed in anything at all other than narcissism and his own self-congratulation.
       </para>
       <para>
        But it is too late, because the Prime Minister's involvement in Aboriginal affairs has been, at best, episodic, ill thought out and self-indulgent. His period of prime ministership has been marked by grand plans, all to raise Aboriginal people's hopes, only for those hopes to be cruelly dashed. We had the grand plan of national land rights promised in 1984, promised in every year until 1988. The Prime Minister had the numbers. He had the support of the Australian Democrats. He never delivered. He never intended to deliver. Then we had the treaty proposed at Barunga in 1988. He said it would be delivered within two years. Nothing happened. The Department of Aboriginal Affairs admitted that nothing had even been contemplated when the Prime Minister made the announcement. In 1983, before the election, we had the promise that all Aboriginal people would be adequately housed within six years. The six years are up and his Minister for Aboriginal Affairs still walks around the country and says how terrible things are.
       </para>
       <para>
        The entire period of the Prime Minister's tenureship has been marked by decisions made from the heart and not from the head. In this debate he has argued by analogy and he has used symbolism. He has not used logic and he has not used substance. Any first year philosophy student will know that arguing by analogy is not a valid argument, and in trying to invoke the symbolism of Noonkanbah again he is missing the total substance of the debate.
       </para>
       <para>
        I want to state quite clearly our position on Bula because the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly), who spoke previously, alluded to it, as did the Prime Minister in Question Time. The Opposition does not deny that this is a very ancient and significant tradition. We do not deny that there are certain sites that are a focus of the Bula legend and that these sites were once the site of ceremony. If we have a look at what was said the other day by Dr Bruce Walpole, who named Coronation Hill in 1953, he said that it was of no religious significance whatsoever.

         â€”He had Jawoyn with him at the time. He would know more than the honourable member. We have also had Mr Joe Fisher, who mined 30,000 tonnes of ore from there in the 1960s, who said exactly the same thing. I do not deny that probably a majority of Jawoyn people today believe that Bula exists at Coronation Hill. However, they did not believe so six years ago. This is the essential flaw in the Government's decision, and it is a tragedy because what the Government has not realised is that what is happening around Australia today is that Aboriginal people are making the associations, both in the Territory and outside the Territory, between mineral deposits located in the ground and the essence of their Dreamtime figures. What is happening is that the actual discovery of mineral deposits is now being seen as evidence of those Dreamtime beings themselves.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Secondly, the nature of any religious tradition has to have the ability to be flexible and have a capacity for interpretation and for reinterpretation. That happens in Western religions and it happens in Aboriginal beliefs. Our society attaches great importance to mineral deposits. These deposits attract a great deal of activity, and this is reflecting back on Aboriginal people's own assessment of how they see those mineral deposits. So essentially Aboriginal belief is adapting, it is changing, and it is reinterpreting. The Minister placed much weight on the fact that the majority of Jawoyn people would now appear to be against mining. Five years ago those same people were just as much in favour of it, and that is the essence of it. Aboriginal belief is changeable, and to lock this away for all time is a complete nonsense and an absolutely crazy decision.
       </para>
       <para>
        The very nature of the changeable, flexible, adaptable Aboriginal interpretation of events is the reason why this is not going to be a one-off decision. By using section 10 (4) of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Heritage Protection Act, the Government has assessed the level of the current Jawoyn tradition in the area in a very different way to what has been done previously under the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act. There has been no proof of territorial ownership in this debate and there has been no assessment of the level of the current Jawoyn tradition applicable to the area.
       </para>
       <para>
        By using a new Act to bring in a determination in this area the Government has deliberately lowered the standard of proof required to make a decision in Aboriginal affairs. Therefore, it is very easy for this to be replicated right round the country. We have seen the beginnings of this today in a press release from the Australian Mining Industry Council which said that $800m worth of projects are at risk now around the country simply because of this decision.
       </para>
       <para>
        Why would the Government make a decision based on the premise that Aboriginal belief is rigid and fixed? That is the essential flaw in the Government's argument. By putting Coronation Hill in the national park, the Government has denied that Aboriginal beliefs are capable of adaptation, capable of change and capable of reinterpretation. As I have said, the Resource Assessment Commission report makes much of the fact that at this point certain beliefs may be that the majority of Jawoyn people do not want mining to proceed. Of those who do not want it to proceed now, many were just as strongly in favour of it five years ago.
       </para>
       <para>
        What really annoys me about this is that in the first real test of the Government's bona fides in Aboriginal affairs, after this Parliament unanimously agreed on a Bill to establish a council of reconciliation, the Government could either look at the issue on its substance and its merits or play politics with the issue. It has played politics. Aboriginal issues are apparently now being given paramount importance, or at least when it suits the Government's thinking. However, ask the Aboriginal people at Jabiluka or Koongarra what they think about this.

        The Aboriginal people have been waiting for 10 years. The Government should also talk to the Aboriginal people at Koongarra. They wanted a uranium mine on their land and signed an agreement with Denison 10 years ago. They will get over $100m over 10 years from that mine, which will make them and their dependants economically independent for ever. The Government is holding it up and it shows its sheer contempt for Aboriginal people when their decision does not suit the Government. The Government will use the Aboriginal people if it suits its purposes. If it does not suit the Government's purposes, it will leave them on the scrapheap. Senator Collins made this point very clearly some months ago. He stated:
       </para>
       <para>
        It is with some resignation that I note that the debate on this matter is proceeding along familiar lines. The key players who are now running this debate are well known to me. A small number of them are consummate ratbags. All of them are running on an agenda that has nothing whatever to do with the long term interests of the Jawoyn community.
       </para>
       <para>
        In this decision there are no winners, only losers. Prior to this debate, Coronation Hill was an insignificant speck of land which did not rate on most maps. It has now been raised to national significance because of dithering, procrastination and prevarication. The real losers are the Aboriginal people like John Nadji and the Koongarra Aborigines who remain on the bottom of the Government's priorities. In the large part of remote and rural Australia, this is the only opportunity for any long term economic independence and now it is being put entirely at risk for short term political expediency.

         â€”We have just witnessed the shallowness, the ignorance and the arrogance of the Opposition's position, involving as it does anti-Aboriginal views. If we want to go to matters of principle and what the Liberal and National parties believe in, then I suggest we refer to the report of the Independent Commission Against Corruption in New South Wales, an investigation of the north coast land development of July 1990, because the belief of the National Party is the holy dollar at the expense of everything else. The Fitzgerald report in Queensland exposed the corruption of the Nationals. What hypocrisy from the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) in leading this debate. What a joke.

        The Jawoyn believe that mining at Coronation Hill would be sacrilege and so should be prevented. It is interesting that the protection of Christian sacred places such as churches is enshrined in our legal system but that Aboriginal sacred sites receive much lesser protection. It is interesting that to Aboriginal people a place of religious significance is such not because that place is a site for worship but because a spiritual being resides there. It is no less a sacred site than a Christian church. Rather than protection being enshrined in our legal system, Aboriginal sacred sites have often been desecrated or their meaning questioned. Such is the hypocrisy that has been displayed earlier today by the Opposition.
       </para>
       <para>
        The best media commentary on this issue was delivered today by Frank Devine on page 11 of the Australian. He stated:
       </para>
       <para>
        The Hawke Government has decided to forbid mining at Coronation Hill out of respect for the belief of an apparent majority of 300 Jawoyn Aborigines that the site, as home of the spirit Bula, is sacred.
       </para>
       <para>
        This is an amazing and historic decision, a radical sidestep from a philosophical position that has hitherto assigned no more than collateral importance to Aborigines and their culture in modern history.
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . . . . . . .
       </para>
       <para>
       </para>
       <para>
        Yet it is a decision that adds a new dimension to the Hawke prime ministership.

       <para>
        Mr Hawke has achieved something no leader has managed in 200 years. He has forced Aboriginal culture into the mainstream of Australian concerns.
       </para>
       <para>
        Even the 1967 referendum, which removed the constitutional requirement that Aborigines ``not be counted'' in the population did not do that. It gave us a feel-good chance of treating Aborigines as legal equals without having to think too much about who they were.
       </para>
       <para>
        Other mining and construction projects have had to accommodate Aboriginal land rights claims and sacred site inhibitions. None has stood out so boldly in the national spotlight as Coronation Hill, nor involved, on the face of it, such an unequal contest-the entire mining industry, backed by the business community generally, against 300 semi-literate Aborigines who were having trouble getting their story straight about the spiritual significance of a nondescript corner of the outback.
       </para>
       <para>
        This is the punch line:
       </para>
       <para>
        So there can be no doubt that Mr Hawke knew exactly what he was doing when he forced the no-mining decision on his Cabinet, nor that he acted with sincerity. It is hardly coincidental that legislation has just been passed to give structure to his grand plan to effect reconciliation between white and black Australians within the next decade.
       </para>
       <para>
        Those who oppose (and perhaps hope to bring down) Mr Hawke with economic arguments against the mining ban will be up against it since his Coronation Hill decision carries the banner of high principle.
       </para>
       <para>
        It also carries with it the banner of leadership. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) has acted properly throughout, and he has continued to act properly in the face of McCarthyism, smear and innuendo against Aboriginal beliefs-arrogance which the Opposition should be ashamed of. Opposition members have been exposed for the hypocrites that they are. This decision will send out a message to the community, to the rank and file of the Australian Labor Party and to ordinary Australians. It shows the stark contrast between this Government and this pathetic Opposition. The Opposition stand on this issue will come home to haunt it in the 1993 election when it is combined with its outrageous stand on the consumption tax.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the time that remains I wish to go to the Resource Assessment Commission (RAC) report, the independent assessment, the umpire's decision, which exposes the lie, which exposes the ignorance of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) who could not even be bothered reading it and got it wrong at his press conference. What a pathetic performance by him! The final report states at 7.134 in relation to the Jawoyn people:
       </para>
       <para>
        The current custodians would experience the greatest loss because of the responsibility they have for the country and the sites of the Zone land for sustaining ``blackfella law''. Their perceived inability to carry out the responsibilities bestowed on them by their fathers and by the Aboriginal community, or to sustain the associated beliefs and practices, will be a source of personal grief, self-recrimination, and harsh judgement by other Aboriginal people.
       </para>
       <para>
        The report also states at 7.126:
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bula tradition is not a modern invention. The concepts of the Sickness Country and multiple Bula sites occur in the first anthropological records of the area, which date back to the early 1950s. Subsequent records are scant, but persistent. By the early 1980s Bula's presence and influence is recorded by anthropological observers as connecting focal sites by a network of sensory links, and as having spheres of influence of up to 10 kilometres around important Bula sites. Bula ceremonies are no longer performed but many Jawoyn people still fear him, songs associated with the tradition are still sung, and restrictions continue to be placed within and around Bula sites by senior Jawoyn men.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is a respected report, the RAC report. It exposes the McCarthyism upon which the Opposition relies, the smear and the innuendo which it perpetrates against the Jawoyn people. At 7.52, the report states:
       </para>
       <para>
        The concept of Sickness Country and multiple Bula sites dates back to the earliest records available (Arndt 1962, 1966).
       </para>
       <para>
        The quotes could go on. At 7.61 the report states:
       </para>
       <para>
        The question of whether the Bula tradition is a `living religion' or an `archaeological relic' is ultimately subjective.
       </para>
       <para>
        The evidence presented to the Inquiry, and confirmed by the Inquiry's consultants . . . confirms that Bula ceremonies are no longer performed, but the beliefs are still widely held, men still sing some associated songs, restrictions continue to be placed . . .

        â€”Normally the Opposition would not make other than a passing comment in relation to this particular motion because it is a procedural motion to ensure that a time is set for the House to meet tomorrow. The time which has been selected by the Government is 10 a.m. I would like to ascertain from the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) information in relation to the procedures for tomorrow because, as I understand it, it is his intention to give notice of motion today that will set out broadly the routine to be followed tomorrow.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       As I understand it, the Government does not propose to provide for Question Time tomorrow; nor will there be an opportunity for a member of this House, and in particular a member of the Opposition, to propose a matter of public importance. It is very important that adequate time should be made available for the questioning of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and his Ministers, and in the view of the Opposition this should occur on every day the House meets.
      </para>
      <para>
       It has become the custom, particularly over recent times, and particularly during the life of this Government, not to have Question Time on the last day of the session if that is one of the two or three days that is selected for the House of Representatives to meet to deal with matters coming back from the Senate. We have got away from it being just an occasional event; it is now something that is happening session after session. We do not come back here for two days at a small cost to the taxpayers; we come back at a very substantial cost. When one considers that factor, along with the need for the Prime Minister and his Ministers to be questioned, then I believe that the Government should provide an opportunity for questions to be asked on those days, and I speak specifically now in relation to tomorrow.
      </para>
      <para>
       Unfortunately, it has been a necessity for me to draw attention to the fact that the Government repeatedly deals with this House in a contemptuous way. Not only will it not provide sufficient time for questions to be asked, and to be answered, without notice, but it is now drifting into a situation where it does not even answer all the questions which are placed on notice. Today's Notice Paper contains no fewer than 16 questions that were placed on notice in 1990. Those questions were put on notice not only by members of the Opposition; some were put on notice by members of the Government.
      </para>
      <para>
       I am glad that the Leader of the House is reaching for his copy of the Notice Paper. Not only do I invite his attention to the questions which remain unanswered from 1990, but also I invite him to take note of the fact that 24 questions were placed on notice between 1 January and the end of March this year-the first three months of this year-so something like 42 questions from the beginning of last year until the end of March this year remain unanswered. Not only is the Government treating the Parliament with contempt in relation to questions without notice; it is also treating the Parliament with contempt in relation to questions which are placed on notice.
      </para>
      <para>
       In a political sense I could understand if the Government was running away from some of our questions because they felt they were just a little too political or too embarrassing for one reason or another, but why is the Government also avoiding answering questions placed on notice by its own members?
      </para>
      <para>
       If that was not enough, let us look at reports of parliamentary committees. If the Government believes that it can sustain an argument in favour of its contemptuous behaviour so far as individual members are concerned, what is its answer in relation to Government responses to reports? Only in the course of the last week we were circulated with a list of these reports. That paper indicates that the Government has yet to respond to 31 committee reports. Some of those reports go back to the time when this Government was elected in 1983, not just last week, last month, last year or the year before.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government is repeatedly treating this House with contempt. By its action, it is treating the people of Australia with contempt. I move the following amendment:

        â€”I do not accept the amendment moved by the Opposition in regard to Question Time. As the Manager of Opposition Business (Mr Fife) suggests, quite rightly, it is my intention to circulate a notice later today relating to the order of business that the Government will activate at the beginning of the parliamentary sitting day tomorrow. It is not completely possible to foresee exactly what will go into that. We need a bit more time to get a better understanding of what is happening in the Senate and a better understanding of where we are left at the end of the day before we are in a position to do that.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       The Opposition is quite right to anticipate that it would not be the Government's intention to proceed with a Question Time or with a matter of public importance. This is not because we denigrate the contribution that they make or the role of this Parliament. It is something of a tradition at these clean-up sessions at the end of a parliamentary session that we come back basically to consider the materials that are handled by the Senate. This has become a tradition that has been followed repeatedly, to my memory. It has become all the more necessary since a particular practice has developed in the Senate for the handling of Government business. That particular practice does chop off consideration of legislation in this House at a particular point. From that point on, the Senate indicates to us that it will consider nothing further until the next session. That has provoked these two sitting days, which of themselves are not particularly desirable.
      </para>
      <para>
       There are one or two points that ought to be made in connection with our sitting on this occasion. During the last few weeks of our sittings we have sent something like 60 Bills to the Senate. Only those with a start-up date on 1 July have been incorporated into a package to be considered. The Senate will return in August to consider the rest, shortly before we return. This has been an unusual action on its part and reflects a distinct slowing in the Senate's preparedness to consider legislation from the House of Representatives that I think is highly undesirable.
      </para>
      <para>
       We have had a very long sitting this year-the longest I can recollect as a member of this Parliament over the last decade. We started unusually early in February and we will finish unusually late in June. In the next session we will start in August and we will finish very late in December. It cannot be said that the processes of Parliament are undergoing any slackening under the influence of the Government and that there has not been enormous opportunity in Question Time and elsewhere for the Opposition to consider Government positions. We have provided another opportunity to do that here again today.
      </para>
      <para>
       We all have other things to do that are of, if not overwhelming importance in relation to the procedures of this House, great significance. As members of parliament we have a great deal to do in our constituencies and overseas for some parliamentary delegations which are travelling. The biennial conference is coming up for members of my own party. We are in a position, as we usually are at the end of this period, where we must make every possibility available to consider materials that come out of the Senate and still conclude business in a reasonable time prior to this weekend. That simply cannot be done if we operate with the normal process of business tomorrow. Hence, the Government's decision.

       The honourable member also raised-I will conclude with this-the question of reports that have not been commented on by Ministers. We take parliamentary reports very seriously. There is a distinct difference between the situation now and the situation that existed prior to when we came into office. As all members of this House would appreciate, particularly since 1988, or maybe 1987, this Government established an unprecedented number of committees associated with this House. As a result, a great deal more has been sent by committees to the Government to which we have to respond. It has not always been possible to respond with the same alacrity, given that pressure of business, as was the situation when we had virtually no committees in this place, as I well recollect when I happened to be a member of the Opposition.

       One would not have raised this complaint simply because there was nothing to respond to. That is not the case now. There are many reasons why there would be a delayed response, not least sometimes because Ministers start action on those propositions and they do not want to respond to them until they have some time to evaluate the effect of those actions. Sometimes it is because of the policy issues that are raised by committees that are of an enormous complexity and require a decent and detailed answer, not one that handballs it out of bounds.

       In those circumstances, the Government does not think that the number of committee reports which have not yet been responded to constitutes an unreasonable list. Certainly, we do not think that that has anything to do with whether there should be a Question Time tomorrow; that particular question is irrelevant to the Opposition amendment.

        That the amendments be agreed to.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Senate has made a total of 42 amendments to the Telecommunications Bill 1991. The Government is prepared to accept all of these because it wishes to honour its commitment to have the new regulatory arrangements in place by 1 July 1991. The critical timing has meant that the Government is prepared to overlook what it views as flaws in the drafting of some of the amendments and flaws in the policy which lies behind particular amendments.
       </para>
       <para>
        In summary, the amendments provide for: additional objects of the Bill; a fuller description of Austel's consumer protection functions; obligations upon all participants in the telecommunications industry to cooperate with law enforcement agencies; certain new arrangements in relation to licences and licence conditions-particularly in relation to the role of parliament with respect to those instruments for carriers to develop a telecommunications industry ombudsman scheme, and a tightening of the operation of the provision providing carriers with an exemption from State and Territory laws.
       </para>
       <para>
        In this regard I note that regulations can still be made under clause 116 of the Bill to exempt carriers from specified laws of a State or Territory. Under section 46(2) of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 specified laws may be interpreted as classes of laws. It would be the Government's intention, in making regulations under clause 116, to rely on this interpretation and specify classes of laws which would not apply.
       </para>
       <para>
        The amendments also provide for a draft of the national environmental and planning code to be published and a public inquiry to be held before it is finalised; the limits on carriers' torts liability to be determined by Austel and to be disallowable by the Parliament; immunity from action to be given to people who make statements or give documents in good faith to Austel public inquiries; an increase in pecuniary penalties under the Bill from $5m to $10m; and for Austel to include in its annual report a copy of all directions that it has issued to carriers subject to appropriate safeguards in relation to confidential information in those directions.
       </para>
       <para>
        Basically, most of the amendments that have been moved we think-in some areas of this place, not in others-are designed to expand parliamentary oversight of the operations of the Bill. It is possible that there will be a difficulty with one of the amendments related to disallowance of licence conditions. However, the preliminary advice that we have received from the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) suggests that that is possibly not the case and that there is an area where that may well be worked around.
       </para>
       <para>
        I must say that when I initially, with some surprise, saw carriage of the Opposition's position in this regard I was, to some extent, alarmed on behalf of the alternative carriers to Telecom Australia. I have since discovered that in fact the position, disallowed or otherwise, does not impede their capacity to put out their network. So, at least on the advice we have to this point, that is not a matter of great concern to anyone. But we will keep an eye on that. If we get subsequent expressions of concern we will consider moving legislation in the Spring session. Given that we do not expect that to be a difficulty, rather than clutter up the Senate at this stage when we are trying to finish this business by the end of tomorrow, the Government has decided to wear it all.
       </para>
       <para>
        I conclude this matter by saying again that I appreciate the service by members of the Department of Transport and Communications in briefing honourable members here. They have had one of those rare experiences for public servants-an experience they would like to keep as rare as possible-of sitting in the Senate while this sort of legislation was handled and trying to respond off the top of their heads to a whole variety of propositions. I think they have done very well in that regard. Also with regard to this particular legislation, as opposed to some others, I thank the Opposition's cooperative attitude that has generally prevailed-both here and in the Senate-when it has had the opportunity to consider these matters. Likewise, as far as the Senate is concerned, I also thank the Australian Democrats.

         â€”I thank the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) for his remarks with regard to the Telecommunications Bill 1991. This is a rather historic Bill. It puts in place a totally new regulatory regime for telecommunications in this country. This Bill goes through with the support of the Opposition. It is interesting to see that the amendments which the Minister has been talking about-some 42-that have been made by the Senate have all been agreed to by the Government and we certainly welcome that. This is not the occasion to go through all of those amendments but, indeed, if one looks at them closely and looks at the debate one will see that the Opposition and the Australian Democrats combined in several areas in order to pass the amendments and the Government, while opposing some, did agree to others.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        As a consequence of a long and detailed debate in the Senate, I think we have a far better Bill. I likewise thank the Minister for the cooperation I received from his officers; they were very helpful. It was a long and tedious debate but I think it was one that was worth having. The impact of this law on Australia and future telecommunications is going to be profound and all of us would want it to work as best it can.
       </para>
       <para>
        There are a couple of points I should make. There are two key areas that the Opposition sought to amend and we were unsuccessful in doing so in the Senate. One was clause 67, where the Opposition sought to remove the term that was to be imposed in the licence to be issued to the new second carrier, whoever that might be; that is the term that will be putting in place the 1997 duopoly. I restate the Opposition's clear view that a duopoly is not the optimal structure we would like to see for the future telecommunications of this country, and that is why we moved to have that clause deleted. The Democrats joined the Government to ensure that that amendment was not successful.
       </para>
       <para>
        The other clause we sought to have deleted was subclause (3) of clause 70. That related to an agreement the Government is going to enter into with the second carrier about the extent of compensation to be paid in the event that licence terms or other licence conditions are changed. We believe that will put a fetter on a future government in dealing with the matter of changing licences; that is, if it wanted to bring forward a more competitive telecommunications system by issuing additional licences to third and fourth network operators.
       </para>
       <para>
        We moved for that clause to be deleted to give effect to our very strong preference to try to create an early environment for competition. We believe that there needs to be a paramount concern to provide the environment for early competition, and that is our priority. The sooner we can get to a better competitive arrangement with network competition, the better we will be. That clause is not one that we believe ought to be in the Bill. Clearly, what we are saying is that we do not recognise that compensation ought to be paid if there is to be a variation of the duopoly term.
       </para>
       <para>
        Some other amendments that came by way of negotiation between the Government, the Democrats and the Opposition are significant-one of which the Minister mentioned in his brief remarks concerning the environment. A new national code with regard to the environment is to be set up to facilitate the roll-out of the new network. That is to ensure that we do not snag up the roll-out of that network by having to comply with a multitude of State planning laws. The important thing-the Democrats made this point, and so did we-is to ensure that there is consultation on the terms of that code and that there is a public inquiry opportunity in advance of that code being settled; it ought not to be a matter between the current Minister for Transport and Communications and the current Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly) at the national level. There needs to be a broader consultation process.
       </para>
       <para>
        That amendment was successful, and I think to have the Government agree to it is significant. We are pleased to have been the ones who helped instigate that change because it signals to the broader community that, whilst we need to facilitate the roll-out of the network, we should always take account of the needs of the environment and the necessity to meet those needs.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Minister also mentioned the amendments that I guess can be encapsulated in the term `greater transparency of ministerial discretion'. There was some doubt, as he said, about one of the amendments we moved and for which we unexpectedly saw the support of the Democrats, for which we are grateful. The Minister's advice, as he has told me now, is that his early concerns were not necessary, and we felt that there was a greater priority to ensure there was transparency. We believe that will be such that it will not fetter the exercise of the licences and issuing the licences.
       </para>
       <para>
        The other points I wish to make relate to another Bill that is yet to be discussed, and I will save my remarks for that. During the debate in the Senate some considerable concern was expressed about the 0055 services offered by Telecom. In one of those services, verbal pornographic type material is provided. Many of us have concerns that it can be accessed by children and we would want to see some restriction on that. How best to deal with that problem is one that faces the Parliament and the nation. We felt it was best that that be dealt with separately from this Telecommunications Bill. We ought not to be visiting upon Austel, the economic and technical regulator, a role in this area, at least not until having canvassed all other alternatives that might be available.
       </para>
       <para>
        We combined with the Democrats, I believe with the understanding and support of the Government, to set up a special Senate select committee on community standards for the supply of telecommunication services. I understand that that committee will be set up tomorrow. I think there will be many in the community who would want to take the opportunity to make submissions to that committee, because out of that we will get a solution to this problem. It is not just a matter of dealing with the 0055 service. The rate of technology movement in this area is significant. We are not dealing just with today, we are dealing with a whole range of future possible options-delivery of computer images into homes, pay television content, and so on. All those issues need to be considered. This committee will give the opportunity to people in the broader community to voice their concerns and for the Parliament to take a focused view of these and to come forward with recommendations.
       </para>
       <para>
        With those few remarks, I reiterate that the Opposition supports this Bill. We think the Government has made a wise decision in accepting all these amendments. Many of them are significant, but at the end of the day they make it a far better Bill. There will be problems with this Bill, as we all know, and it will not be long perhaps before we have to deal with some further amendments. In any event, this is a fast-moving area. It is the growth industry in this nation, and we are pleased to have played a very positive part in ensuring that the rule book-this legislation-is a better rule book and one that will facilitate change and bring about far more quickly than otherwise a better competitive arrangement in the telecommunications industry in this country.

The Government is prepared to accept all of the amendments-with great reluctance-but it retains some policy difficulties with some of them and uncertainties arise because of the drafting of others.
       </para>
       <para>
        One amendment made by the Senate is that the interpretation clause of the Bill is to provide that a person appointed to certify that specified transactions or matters are to be exempt from tax is to be appropriately qualified and experienced. We do not have a problem with that. Another amendment is that the Minister for Transport and Communications is to cause a copy of the constituent documents of the Australian and Overseas Telecommunication Corporation (AOTC) to be laid before each House of Parliament within 15 sitting days of the merger. We do not have a great problem with that.
       </para>
       <para>
        Another amendment is that the Minister is to determine the initial capital of the AOTC and that the Minister's determination is subject to disallowance. This does create some substantial drafting uncertainties. The expression `initial capital' is not used in the corporations law under which the company's capital will be determined. Moreover, the corporations law provides that the issued capital of the company should be determined by the company's board. Nevertheless, in accordance with the terms of the amendment, I will consult with the board and make a determination based on the advice received from the board.
       </para>
       <para>
        I have been advised also that my determination will have no legal effect on the capital structure of the company as that capital is determined under the provision of the corporations law. Accordingly, it is not clear whether disallowance of my determination would have any practical effect. The advice given to me by Attorneys-General to this point is absolutely clear: disallowance will have no practical effect. But it is something that we will continue to need to be advised on. That is as it stands at the moment. Again, we thought that the advice which had been offered to us in that regard needed a little further examination and ought not to delay consideration by this Parliament any longer. If there is a substantial problem with it, we can come back to address that in the spring session.
       </para>
       <para>
        Another amendment details that no fee is to be paid or is payable by Telecom Australia, OTC Ltd or AOTC as a result of, or in connection with, the merger. I make no secret of the fact that this is a matter of considerable disappointment to the Government. The Government considers that the Australian community has a right to share in the financial benefits which will flow from any increase in the efficiency and profitability of the Government's business enterprises as a result of the merger.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government does not believe that the telecommunications carriers themselves should get windfall gains from policy changes. The Government has not given up the idea of seeking an appropriate return from the carriers in recognition of the benefits of the merger to them. We may return this matter to the Parliament in the Budget sittings, once we have considered the advice of the interim board on the full range of financial questions. I note also that the proclamation of the Act to bring about the merger is entirely at the discretion of the Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        We do not think that it would be wise for us to send it back to the Senate at this time, certainly in the absence of a final piece of advice to the Government from the interim board on its view about what the financial structure ought to be and whether a merger fee, if any, should be paid. These matters were deliberated in great detail both in this House and in the Senate, and to send the Bill back to the Senate at this point, when the Government does not have a completely finalised position, in our view, would be fruitless.
       </para>
       <para>
        If the Opposition and the Australian Democrats are going to change their minds, they will probably want to view that possibility within the context of a specific series of propositions. For the reasons that I have outlined, it is not possible to place that series of propositions before them. Therefore, to send the Bill back to the Senate at this point would be an exercise in futility in which we do not wish to engage. I give notice that at some time during the next session there may be a need for us to come back and work this through again.
       </para>
       <para>
        Another amendment goes to the Government's ability to determine, by way of regulations under the Bill, which Commonwealth, State and Territory laws may or may not apply to the AOTC. When this was deliberated in the Senate I had just flown in from Western Australia and, having nothing better to do at 1 o'clock in the morning, I turned on the television set to find a matter of some substantial dispute proceeding between my representative in the Senate, the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Collins), and the Democrats on whether they were supporting the Opposition in its benighted amendments. The Heritage Act had inadvertently been knocked out and, on my behalf, Senator Collins gave an undertaking-at some risk, given that he had not picked up the phone-to assure us all that the heritage legislation would cover it and promised that we would move accordingly here. Indeed, we would have, if we had believed it to be necessary. As I now understand it, on advice that we have received to this point, the heritage legislation covers it anyway; therefore, the requirement to specify that in the legislation is not there.
       </para>
       <para>
        Finally, the Environmental Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act will continue to apply to the AOTC in conjunction with the national planning and environment code. In the end, we found this acceptable, if somewhat messy. We had discussed this with the Opposition before the Bill went to the Senate. We anticipate that the national planning and environment code probably will be a considerably more updated and modern approach to the environmental issues involved than is provided by the Act. After all, the Act is now very old-at least a decade old. Certainly, it would be most unlikely that in the national planning and environment code we would come up with a set of requirements which would be less restrictive than the Environmental Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act currently is. We do not see any great difficulty in the co-existence of the two; accordingly, we find that amendment not unacceptable.
       </para>
       <para>
        Overall, we expect that the organisation that will emerge from this legislative process will be a very powerful organisation in Australian terms, but not so much so when compared to operations elsewhere. As was pointed out in the initial debate on this, it is the norm that the main telecommunications carriers in each country operate both domestically and internationally, so what is being created here is the equivalent of the sorts of telcos that operate throughout Europe and most of the Asian region. There are a few exceptions to this sort of practice-Japan being one-but, by and large, this is the case.
       </para>
       <para>
        Given the contemporary nature of communications technology, the creation of artificial divisions, as we have had in years past, is no longer sensible or efficacious for Australian industry. We are pleased that, even though we have some problems with bits and pieces of the amendments that have been moved, fundamentally the Senate has agreed with us that the merger ought take place and that it will strengthen the Australian role in international communications as a result.

         â€”The Opposition opposed the Australian and Overseas Telecommunications Corporation Bill when it first came to this chamber, and the Opposition also opposed it when it was before the Senate. It comes back here amended and it will pass because the Australian Democrats have joined the Government to enable it to do so. When it was in the Senate we moved several amendments. Most of those amendments are now incorporated in this schedule that the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) has presented, and we are extremely pleased particularly with one of those amendments that is included and has been accepted.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Let me comment on some of the matters that the Minister has raised, the first being the amendment to clause 9 which required that the memorandum and articles of association of the new Corporation be tabled in the House and laid before the Parliament. This was a proposal along with several others to try to provide the Parliament with the opportunity to look more closely at the formation of what will be, next to Broken Hill Proprietary Co. Ltd, the largest corporation in this country. We moved further amendments to recognise that, in so doing, we wanted it to be truly reflective of a commercial organisation with a proper capital base.
       </para>
       <para>
        The amendment that appears there as No. 3 is a combination of the sentiments expressed not only in our amendments but also in those of the Australian Democrats. That requires the Minister to consult with the board. True, he comments about the interpretation of `initial capital', the effect of his consultation with the board, and whether or not under the corporations law in any event the disallowance would apply. But, it is Parliament's clear intention that the Minister consult and take account of the board's advice to him; after all, the board will be charged to act commercially under all the requirements of the corporations legislation and it would not be, in our view, good commercial practice for a Minister to intervene and try to put in place non-commercial requirements on the board. To have it as transparent as possible and to require consultation is the thrust of that amendment.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Minister made other points relating to clause 11b, being the merger fee which is the issue with which the Minister is most disappointed, and understandably so. The honourable member for Bruce (Mr Beale) will elaborate on the reasons for the merger fee proposal. However, it would be appropriate to say that the merger fee amendment, which says that there shall not be a merger fee, is very significant because the merger fee arose out of a special privatisation conference; it was the cost that was promised to those to come across and vote for the privatisation of the airlines.
       </para>
       <para>
        The idea was to get the cash-and I think it was Senator Richardson who put the figure into the marketplace of about $1 billion. It was proposed to take $1 billion out of Telecom-OTC and put it into Consolidated Revenue; it would be earmarked for infrastructure spending, the first of which was to be for railways. That would therefore guarantee that the votes, particularly from the Centre Left out of South Australia, would be where the Government wanted them to be. The Minister for Transport and Communications then could get his privatisation up with regard to Australian Airlines and regrettably only 49 per cent of Qantas.
       </para>
       <para>
        So, that was and is the reason why the Government would want this merger fee to go through, and that is the reason why the Opposition and the Democrats combined to make sure that there was not to be a merger fee or at least to attempt to make sure there will not be a merger fee, because it is clear that the Parliament has indicated that it does not want there to be a claim for a merger fee by the Government. It is all right for the Minister to argue that there be an appropriate return, but these are two public institutions being combined together. We believe that to take a merger fee out has two evils, the first being that it will weaken the capital base and the commerciality of the new organisation prior to it starting, and the second being that, in so doing and in so weakening it, we then have to see the organisation take further borrowings or increase its revenue, and it can only do that by increasing its fees to customers and, therefore, ipso facto, we would see the charges to consumers go up.
       </para>
       <para>
        So they are the reasons why we do not believe there ought to be a merger fee. It ought to be rejected. I did make the comment the other day that now it has been rejected there ought not to be a backdoor approach to try to give effect to what was really a political deal. We do not know whether or not there will be a claim against Telecom under the interim dividend provisions of the Act, prior to that Act ceasing by effect of this Act-and I note, as did the Minister, that the proclamation date of this Act is flexible. I would not like to see that happen because that would have the same effect.
       </para>
       <para>
        If my understanding of the interim dividend clause is correct, one can make a claim for an interim dividend so long as it does not exceed the profit of the organisation in any year. That, of course, would lead to the possibility of the Government being able to obtain a very large sum out of Telecom in advance of this new organisation being formed. I think that would be regrettable, and I think the Parliament's intention here is that it clearly does not want that to happen.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Minister has indicated that he may be coming back, I take it with legislation, so we will await with interest to see what it is he is proposing. But I felt it important to make those remarks. The final points the Minister made were with regard to Senator Collins's performance in the Senate. I sat through that marathon debate as well and I thought Senator Collins did a creditable job with what was a very difficult piece of legislation. I am pleased to hear that his unauthorised undertakings have not ended up causing trouble for either himself or ourselves.

        I want to make a couple of remarks about the Australian and Overseas Telecommunications Corporation's initial capital and the merger fee relating to the financial viability of the merged corporation. To that end, I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard two graphs which will assist with the explanation that I am about to give on the balance sheet of the merged company.

        <para in-line="1">
         â€”I thank the House. The question of the balance sheet of the merged Corporation is very important. It is important because that Corporation will be competing with organisations from overseas that do, on the face of it, appear to have balance sheets that are much stronger than the merged Corporation's. I refer to the two documents that have just been incorporated into Hansard and start with the comparison of the debt ratios of the merged Telecom-OTC and its international competitors.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The Minister made the point that he thought Telecom-OTC was now in a position to compete with those overseas companies. As far as the debt ratio comparison is concerned, the merged Telecom-OTC shows a debt ratio of 51 per cent. Bell South which, for example, as I understand it, is one of the companies that is leading a consortium to compete with Telecom-OTC, shows a debt ratio of 39 per cent. The 51 per cent by the merged Telecom-OTC puts it into a Standard and Poor's benchmark rating of BBB, whereas that for Bell South puts it on the edge of A and running close into a Standard and Poor's AA ratio. Telecom's current Standard and Poor's ratio is AA as a result of the implied guarantee by the Government. As far as interest cover is concerned, the merged Corporation of Telecom-OTC has a 2.4 interest cover, Bell South has 4.2 and Ameritech has 5.4.
       </para>
       <para>
        So, we are concerned that the balance sheet of AOTC will simply not be strong enough to enable it to compete with these other organisations. Not only that; its balance sheet does not seem to me to give an appropriate debt-equity ratio for any organisation, whether it be a government business enterprise or otherwise. It is extraordinary that, on the one hand, the Minister is talking about extracting a $1 billion merger fee from the merging of Telecom and OTC and, on the other hand, Telecom has got its hand out to the Government for immediate borrowings of $300m.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Minister made some remarks about the initial capital of the merged Corporation and it would seem to me to be fairly clear that, whatever the wording and whatever the legal position, the intent is that when Telecom and OTC are put together there will be an amount of equity that could, I think, equally well be described as its initial capital.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is therefore within the Minister's power to determine the extent of that equity or initial capital; and it is in the Minister's power, if he chooses to do so, for example, to convert some of the debt owed by the merged Corporation to the Government into that initial capital. I think that is the intent of what the Senate is saying. Certainly it is the intent of what we have proposed and, as I understand it, with which the Democrats have agreed. So the Minister does have it within his power to determine that initial capital and to do so after having had regard to relevant advice that the board may give the Minister.
       </para>
       <para>
        I need hardly say to the Minister that members of Telecom, members of OTC and members of the board have publicly expressed concern about the capital structure of the merged Corporation, and I think it would be surprising if they did not tender advice to the Minister which suggested that he should strengthen the equity or the initial capital of the Corporation. We would quite understand if the Government chose not to make an additional equity injection in order to get the debt-equity ratio of the merged Corporation under control, but it is certainly within its capability to convert debt to equity or to initial capital. We would ask the Minister if he would follow the spirit of what the Senate clearly requires and give appropriate consideration to the board's advice.
       </para>
       <para>
        I believe it is also true that the intent of the Senate, as far as the merger fee is concerned, is that no fee should be paid. It does seem a bit surprising to me that the Government should require the two corporations to merge and, as a result of that, extract a merger fee. If the two corporations voluntarily decided that as a result of the merger they were so grateful to the Government that they wanted to pay the Government something, that would be one thing; but as one looks at the two balance sheets of the separate companies and then looks at the balance sheet of the merged company, it is quite clear that financially they cannot stand that merger fee. Our intent in moving this amendment in the Senate is to ensure that no fee or payment or consideration should be paid. I think we would take a rather dim view of it if, with the intent of no merger fee on the table, the Minister then found an alternative device that enabled him to extract money from the merged Corporation and, in doing so, to weaken the balance sheet of the organisation.
       </para>
       <para>
        There were a couple of remarks passed by Senator Schacht in the Senate during the debate on those particular clauses that have resulted in this amendment. I think he interjected on three occasions that our purpose in seeking to have the balance sheet strengthened was so that we could privatise the organisation. It is true, as the Minister knows, that provided we do have a competitive framework established-and it is a competitive framework that the Minister is seeking to establish-provided there is a contestable market, we would in due course seek to transfer the ownership of the merged Corporation from the public sector to its employees and private investors. But that is not the reason why we are seeking to have the balance sheet in proper shape at the moment.
       </para>
       <para>
        If we were to privatise the merged Corporation-the AOTC-the balance sheet would need to be improved, and the Minister has discovered this in all the discussions he has had about the airlines. In fact, I understand he is on record as saying that if he sells 49 per cent of Qantas Airways Ltd, the proceeds will be reinjected back into Qantas in order to make it viable. There is the same sort of situation here with AOTC.
       </para>
       <para>
        However, I want to underline that the reason we want the balance sheet of the merged Corporation in shape now is not solely that we want to privatise the organisation; we want to see the balance sheet in shape so that we can have an open, viable, competitive Australian owned telecommunications Corporation to compete with the second carrier that the Minister is in the process of organising.
       </para>
       <para>
        I will close by again saying that we regret that we are not able to have Telecom and OTC in competition, but we are very pleased that these amendments-and particularly amendments numbered 3 and 4-are back here, so that we can have the merged Corporation as a very competitive organisation to compete in this most important area.

         â€”Now that the would-be entrepreneurs have finished their spiel on the flotations and their understanding of the finances in the current depressed climate, I want to raise a fairly fundamental matter relating to Telecom Australia. Prima facie, it seems to be a small matter, but it is not.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        It has come to my notice that the benefit of being issued with these very handy Telecards-all members of parliament have them and members of the Australian community can purchase them to make their calls-is that they are charged to a particular number, the caller gives a personal identification number (PIN), and they either use an operator or they dial automatically. With certain systems there are some telephones that are not set up for automatic calling, so an operator assisted calling mechanism is used where a particular number-11333-is dialled, the caller asks for the operator and gives the Telecard number and the PIN number, and is then connected to the number that is called.
       </para>
       <para>
        I have discovered, both by dint of complaint made to me and by my own dialling, that operators actually listen to the conversations. This is the only instance I know of at this moment of operators seemingly being instructed to listen to conversations, although-as I am instructed today, having been in contact with an officer from Telecom-they are instructed to do so for a limited period, and it is for an understandable reason. It is evident that Telecom, which of course, understandably, is paranoid about the number of complaints in the community about overcharging, instructs the operator to listen to the conversation to determine when the conversation has actually occurred and-in the words of the officer speaking to me-until the operator is satisfied that there is a two-way conversation. When she is satisfied that there is a two-way conversation, she will plug it in and the charges start.
       </para>
       <para>
        I can understand that, but there are occasions-apart from when the Leader of the Opposition in Victoria calls me on a car phone-when I sometimes do not necessarily respond to the party on the other end that I am calling. That may surprise honourable member opposite, but in this technological age there are such things as answering machines. For example, when I am travelling, I will call my home base answering machine to get the messages that are left for me. On the occasions that I have done that, the operator, having been told to listen to a two-way conversation, has dutifully listened to all my messages being played over while I am taking those messages. I have not, in the course of the past few weeks, been calling, as Labor members have been calling, one P. J. Keating or one R. J. L. Hawke, but it would be very interesting to learn whether on occasions when they have had cause to ring me in the past people have known of this.
       </para>
       <para>
        More to the point, the mere fact that it is permissible for operators to be listening to conversations ought to be something which we should have a good look at. I am certainly going to look at this question because I think that even if the Telecommunications (Interception) Act does not apply-and I had not anticipated being able to speak on this matter; I have risen without any checking on this, having spoken to the Telecom officer only this afternoon-I believe it applies generally to listening devices, recorded conversations and things like that.
       </para>
       <para>
        If it does not apply, then it might be necessary to look to see whether the Privacy Act applies and whether Telecom is in breach of the Privacy Act. The Privacy Commissioner is empowered under the Privacy Act generally to look at a whole range of matters, but they are usually files and other matters that are kept on people. I do recall only a matter of months ago the Privacy Commissioner indicating that he had investigated a complaint by a New South Wales citizen-I think a New South Wales member of parliament-alleging that the New South Wales police force was making nuisance calls to him, or threatening calls, et cetera, and the Privacy Commissioner, as I recall, did investigate that.
       </para>
       <para>
        That leads me to the view that it could be possible under the Privacy Act for the Privacy Commissioner to have some power in this arena. I do not know, but during the recess I will check out the application of those Acts. I do not think, even though prima facie it appears an amusing thing, that the great bulk of Australians would want operators listening to their telephone calls. Most of them have not experienced reading about them on the front page of newspapers, as I have, but the majority of them would defend their right to call whoever they want and speak to them in privacy about whatever matter they, as Australian citizens, are entitled to and express themselves in whichever way they choose-save and except for engaging in treasonable or other seditious activities, which would be actionable, of course, by various means.
       </para>
       <para>
        Meanwhile, subscribers ought to be warned that operators are empowered to listen to calls. I am sure Telecom is justified in saying that it simply wants to ensure that it does not overcharge the subscriber, and that I totally understand. I would not want this to be taken as some attack on Telecom's ham-fistedness. I believe that it just wants to ensure that there is a proper record of the actual time rather than charges being rendered when people did not get through or some other mistake occurred. It is a classic case, as so often happens, where there can be a conflict of principle, and perhaps we have to look at this question of ensuring the privacy of telephone calls on the basis also of reasonable charges from the commencement time.

         â€”I want to add to what was said by the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock), because I had a personal experience which bore out his point. I had some difficulty getting an operator to get a phone call through to my home. When I eventually, after several tries, did get through to my home, my first comment to my wife was to complain bitterly about the standard of the telephone service. I was rather surprised when the operator broke in and started arguing with me. I just mention that to the Minister for Transport and Communications (Mr Beazley) because it did cause me a bit of a shock. I suppose most of the calls I make to my wife would be described as profoundly boring to anyone but her and me. However, I think my constituents and others that I telephone would probably be a little surprised to think that there is a third party listening. I must say that I was surprised on that occasion, and eventually the altercation subsided.

        I mention it to the Minister simply to bear out the point made by the honourable member for Kooyong. It did shock me but, unfortunately, I did not follow it up as assiduously as he appears to have done today. I simply say to the Minister that I hope he is able to take on board the honourable member's comments and see whether some better procedures can be devised.

         â€”I must say I am very grateful that there are at least a couple of people in this House who are prepared to feed my paranoia as well and have presented me with evidence. I think Telecom listens to my conversations all the time! How else would these stories keep appearing in the newspaper on a weekly basis, which are alleged to be my views-and sometimes are. I can think of only one place that I have expressed those views.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        It is quite clear that there are some serious implications in what has been put forward by honourable members. I will definitely look into this matter now and get them some appropriate responses. I think honourable members would comprehend from all this that it is very easy for people's conversations to be listened in on. There are in place very serious laws that became somewhat more serious after the conversations of the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) managed to make it to the front pages. At least there is a situation applying now where, if anyone tries to do that again, that newspaper will find itself in the choky; and if they can discover who gave it to the newspaper, that person will find himself in the choky as well and the honourable member will no longer be able to be successfully prosecuted for obscenity or anything else. So clearly there are better protective devices for disclosure of conversations.
       </para>
       <para>
        I find even more extraordinary the proposition of the honourable member for Pearce (Mr Chaney) that he had an argument on the subject of whether or not he was being competently served. I cannot for the life of me think of any justification for that happening. It reminds me of an occasion when I was visiting one country a fair distance from here and there was some suspicion as to whether or not one's conversations were being recorded. We decided we would test that by going through a similar process to that engaged in by the honourable member for Pearce, though in his case his complaint about the service was inadvertent. I complained first about the absence of soap in the rooms. I went out and about an hour later came back and every single ashtray was full of soap. I thought I would go one further and complain about the absence of alcohol in the room and came back and found that that had been dealt with satisfactorily as well.
       </para>
       <para>
        So the honourable member for Pearce was obviously testing the system in that cunning and innovative way of his. Perhaps he might make suggestions to the honourable member for Kooyong as to how he should go about testing whether or not his answering service is being properly utilised. Perhaps we could make a link between the 0055 number and the answering service of the honourable member for Kooyong and actually get something interesting on it. However, that matter will definitely be looked into and I will give both honourable members a response in due course.

         â€”I do not want to take up the chamber's time unduly, but I think comment is warranted on these amendments since the Education Services (Export Regulation) Bill returns to this chamber a substantially different Bill from the Bill that left it. I understand that in the Senate the other night some 29 amendments were moved to this piece of legislation and that the Opposition moved nine amendments to the Bill which were accepted by the Senate. The fact that this has occurred is a very sobering commentary on the way in which the export of education has been dealt with by this Government and, I would say, the lack of care that has been taken, particularly by the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins), in the preparation of this legislation.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        When the legislation was introduced into this House originally, the Opposition pointed out that it was, first of all, an extremely poorly drafted piece of legislation that included provisions which, on their face, would have regulated every provider of education in Australia whether or not overseas students were the recipients of that education. The music teacher down the road who never had any overseas students would have been regulated by this Bill.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill also included draconian provisions which, had they survived the Senate's considerations, would have had a very damaging effect on the education export industry in this country. The Government proposed to compel all providers to present quarterly audited reports on the state of accounts. These accounts were to be regulated in the most detailed way. Given the circumstances of the industry, providers were to be required to take out insurance that would undoubtedly have been expensive insurance. Apparently these provisions were put into this legislation without any consideration as to their likely impact on the industry. Indeed, one of the features of this legislation was that it came forward without consultation with any of the significant providers of education services to overseas students. This has been denied by the Minister. I repeat the claim because every provider knows that to be the case. Providers discovered that this legislation had come into the Parliament when they were notified by the Opposition. The Opposition has provided the opportunity to this industry to be fully consulted on this piece of legislation.
       </para>
       <para>
        During the period when this legislation has been before the Parliament two reports have been received by the Government from the Industry Commission-one by Tony Harris acting as a consultant, the other being a report from Tony Harris with another commissioner. Both these reports have called into question the need for this legislation at all.
       </para>
       <para>
        The most recent report received only two weeks ago struck at the very roots of this legislation and made it quite clear that in the view of the authors of this report-it is a draft report-this legislation is misconceived legislation and does not effectively address the issues which are really troubling this industry. In particular, the Industry Commission draft report made the point that the real focus of attention of this Government ought to be on the immigration regulations and the policing of those regulations and not on the regulation of the providers in the detailed and centralised way which was proposed through this legislation.
       </para>
       <para>
        This statement by the Industry Commission fully vindicated the criticisms made of the original Bill by the Opposition, it fully vindicated the criticisms of the legislation by the industry itself and it demonstrated and highlighted what the Opposition has been saying over many months in relation to the Minister's gross mishandling of this area; that is, that the industry has been used by the Government as a scapegoat for the totally unsatisfactory policy which was pursued by this Government over the course of the last three years and which led to the creation of the circumstances in which many thousands of students lost their deposits; their money was lost and their studies were disrupted.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government is culpable in this area and not the industry. The original legislation which came before this Parliament was punitive legislation of the worst kind, and we said so. Since the legislation was introduced there has been the most extensive consultation by the Opposition with the industry and with students. As a result, amendments have been brought forward by the Opposition in the Senate. There were also government amendments. The government amendments addressed criticisms that were made by the Opposition when the Bill was first introduced into this chamber. So right down the line to today's re-presentation of this greatly amended piece of legislation to this chamber, the Government has been forced to concede by its actions that the original Bill was a disgrace and should never have been introduced into this Parliament in the way in which it was.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Opposition has taken into account the views of the industry: the need to provide a viable regime for the industry because it is potentially an industry of enormous importance to this country and the need not to misrepresent to students what this legislation can secure to them because the protection that it offers to students must not be exaggerated for reasons which the Industry Commission makes very plain in its report.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Opposition in the Senate has also inserted a sunset clause to this legislation which acknowledges the fact made to the Government at the time when the original legislation was drafted that there was only a temporary need, if any need at all, for this Bill. The current situation is, and I quote the Industry Commission report:
       </para>
       <para>
        It is clear that education exports are being impeded by current arrangements.
       </para>
       <para>
        That means by current government policies. It cast its nets wide, and I think appropriately wide, to point out that the impediments to the industry are impediments which arise from the characteristics of the highly regulatory policy for higher education which the Government pursues.

         â€”I thank the honourable member for Pearce for his very public spirited intervention in this debate. As I was saying, the Industry Commission report claims that the impediments to the export of education which still exist in this country are not impediments which arise from difficulties within the industry, they are impediments which arise from the nature of the policies which the Government currently has in place.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        They are impediments which arise from the Government's immigration policies and the failure-one must say the very consistent failure over a number of years-of the Government to establish proper coordination between the Department of Employment, Education and Training policies in this area and the policies of the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs. That lack of coordination has been a matter of comment on the public record by many of the most respected providers of education services to overseas students, including the university sector. It is an area which still needs to be addressed by the Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Opposition was particularly interested, however, to read in the Industry Commission report that there are serious difficulties which arise out of the inflexible arrangements which the Government has provided for higher education. In particular, the report concluded that it was highly desirable that institutions be given the right to provide additional places to Australian students as well as to overseas students, even if this meant charging Australian students fees for those places. It made that recommendation on the basis that Australian institutions believe that there is a limit to the number of places that they can offer to overseas students who are fee paying students because the occupancy of these places by overseas students limits the number of places that can be offered to Australian students.
       </para>
       <para>
        The report makes plain that this is not a technical limitation; but it is a limitation in terms of the educational objectives of these institutions. Institutions believe that they must have an appropriate balance between overseas students and Australian students, and anyone with a knowledge of higher education in this country will be aware that this is a continuing consideration by institutions in determining the number of overseas students that they are able to admit.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Industry Commission takes the view that there should be much greater flexibility on the part of institutions to offer additional positions to Australian students so that the services which they have to offer can be offered to a broader number of students in the overseas student market.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Industry Commission made a number of other comments on the restricted nature of the market for education services in Australia, and it urged the further deregulation and freeing up of this market in order to provide these institutions with the maximum capacity to take advantage of what is a very large international market in this area for education services. It requested a further reference to consider an appropriate method for allocating places in higher education. This method, it said, should be one:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . which takes better account of the value to society and to the student personally of education services.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Industry Commission meant by this that we should move away from a system for controlling higher education in this country which looks like the poor shadow of a system borrowed from eastern Europe before the changes that have taken place in recent times, and exchange that for a system for managing higher education which is more appropriate to a society which understands the importance of independent institutions with the flexibility to respond to the market provided by those they are supposed to serve.
       </para>
       <para>
        I want to say on behalf of the Opposition in this House that we support the view of the Industry Commission that there should be a further reference to it to enable it to explore appropriate mechanisms for higher education which would allow a freeing up in this sector.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let me conclude by saying that the presentation of the Education Services (Export Regulation) Bill to this chamber this evening is not the end of this sorry saga. The Bill before us is a minimally acceptable piece of legislation. It has been made minimally acceptable by the enormous effort that certain of our senators have put into examining this legislation through the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Education and Training. Our senators have put in many hours of work. I want to pay tribute particularly to Senator John Tierney, Senator Winston Crane, Senator Teague and Senator Paul Calvert for their efforts on behalf of the exporters of education from this country so that we now have a Bill which, it is plain, will not be destructive and disruptive of the activities of this industry.
       </para>
       <para>
        But the Bill is only minimally acceptable. It does not address the fundamental problems which are holding back the export of education in this country. Those problems will not be addressed until the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) decides to take an interest in this area. We have seen a history of quite disgraceful neglect. It is characteristic, I regret to say, of the Minister that, following the original flashing of the light bulb which suggests that there is a good idea to be followed, there has been very little follow-up to make sure that the idea is being implemented appropriately.

         â€”Maybe the Minister at the table, the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Tickner), would care to contribute to this debate and defend the Government in this area; if he were to do so, I would say he would be a Minister of considerable courage, because there is no convincing defence to be made.

       <para>
        We have here a piece of legislation which was drafted at the last moment because no proper consideration was given by the Minister to the need to bring it into the Parliament, which accounts in large part for its disgraceful character. Then, again at the very last moment, after months of further neglect, the Minister decided that he had to get something through the Parliament, so he decided to accept amendments that had been put forward so that there is some legislation here and so that he has something to show for all those undertakings which he gave on his recent trip to the countries sending students to us. I am sure he assured them that there would be a framework, and at least there is this Bill, which we have managed to produce in a minimally acceptable form. But the job remains to be done, and until it is done this country will not be taking full advantage of the very high quality services that we are able to offer to the world.

I made that point then.

        The old gag about the opera being over when the fat lady sings seems to have more than passing application. The failed ex-Treasurer has claimed to be the Placido Domingo of economic gurus in Australia. By the same token, the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) might claim to be a sort of Luciano Pavarotti when it comes to application of the guillotine in this place. In any event, when he sings, debate on his own Government's legislation is over, curtailed or contracted to the extent that it all becomes pretty meaningless. When Big Luci sings in this place we can forget, arguably, the prime task we were elected to undertake-that is, to critically examine all legislation, if only to help ensure that that same legislation will meet the Government's stated objectives. Plainly, that is not possible under the guillotine. That point was made-I repeat-by me during the debate on the second reading.

        While on the subject of guillotines, to put it in some broader context, 114 separate Bills have been guillotined through this Parliament in the little over a year that has elapsed since May 1990. Forty-eight of those Bills were guillotined through the House during the past two sitting weeks, indicating that the treatment we have to endure is getting worse rather than better. With 114 Bills guillotined through the House, I estimate that-although I cannot claim to be exact because I have not done the exact count-25 to 30 per cent of all Bills passed through the House in the thirty-sixth Parliament have been under the guillotine. I will continue to make that point for as long as the Leader of the House and the Government treats the House with the contempt they do, and as often as I get the opportunity to do so.

        As to the 17 amendments to copious legislation, comprised of some 76 pages of complex tax legislation, ranging over not just one principal Act but others, we get some idea of the extent of the Government's inadequacies and inefficiencies in the first place when it framed this legislation. It is not as though many of the amendments now under consideration were not foreshadowed by both myself and Senator Watson in the other place during the second reading debates.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is also interesting to know-I hope I am correct because I cannot see him-that the Minister with responsibility for carriage of this Bill in the first place, and therefore presumably with an interest in these amendments, is not in the chamber to respond to any views we might like to express in this place. It is another example of the contempt with which the Government treats the House of Representatives.
       </para>
       <para>
        We have 17 amendments before us. I say so with reluctance because it is not his fault that the Minister at the table, the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Tickner), has not spoken to these 17 amendments. I have the schedule in my hands. Its eight pages comprise 17 amendments. Not one word of explanation is given to this Committee as to why Government-initiated changes in the Senate are necessary. I know why some of them are necessary, but that is not the point I wish to make. The Committee deserves an explanation of why these further changes to such complex legislation, debated only a few weeks ago in this House, are required now.
       </para>
       <para>
        As to the substance of the amendments, given Senator Watson's thorough examination and proposals he was able to make, I have cause to be confident that what is proposed is acceptable. Like Senator Watson, I qualify that acceptance and that confidence.
       </para>
       <para>
        I would like to touch on a few of the specific measures. Again, because the Minister at the table-who is not the responsible Minister, I hasten to add-was not able to discuss any or all of these 17 amendments, I am at a loss to know from a reading of the schedule which amendment applies to what clause of the Bill. Some of the clauses are familiar to me, but some are not.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the first place, when the Bill went through the House we made the point that when talking last year about the Taxation Laws Amendment (Foreign Income) Bill 1990 it was abundantly clear that further changes were required. They were required then and they are still required. We see some evidence of those in these amendments, although in my opinion and in the opinion of the coalition they do not go far enough and we do have some reservations.
       </para>
       <para>
        Regrettably, the power of the Commissioner remains enhanced because he has a requirement placed on him to issue rulings to clarify obscurities in the legislation. Those obscurities can be attributed to the drafting of the legislation. With a little more care and with the objective which the Government claims of introducing plain English into its legislation, it should not have been necessary for us to make special comment on it here.
       </para>
       <para>
        The thin capitalisation amendments are okay with us. There are further changes proposed in these amendments to the amending Bill dealing with deductibility for new fencing to prevent land degradation. That was an issue that I canvassed during the second reading debate. My understanding of the amendment under consideration now is that it is far better and meets my objections, and I think most of the objections of the coalition.
       </para>
       <para>
        Cross-compliance costs were to be higher; these amendments will reduce them significantly. That is also welcome. They are still too high and, in my opinion, unnecessarily high. But we can live with that. There is some improvement and that, as I mentioned, is acceptable.

         â€”Thank you, Mr Deputy Chairman. I also mention the concerns which we expressed during the guillotined debate on the second reading. We were worried about the lack of treatment, as it were, of tax deductibility for expenses incurred in the rehabilitation of exploration, mining and quarrying operations. In particular, we canvassed the views of the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association (APEA) and ran up against a blank wall from the Minister who had the carriage of the Bill.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        However, I am pleased to note that Senator McMullan, in a much more cooperative and constructive approach to tax legislation, with my colleagues in the Senate, now acknowledges that there are matters which have to be rectified in the legislation in this connection. Unfortunately, again because of the use of the guillotine and our inability to canvass and suggest alternatives, these concerns will not be rectified in the amendments before us.
       </para>
       <para>
        Senator McMullan has indicated that the Government intends to address these concerns in the Budget session. That simply should not be necessary, as I have already said. The matters calling for rectification should have been stitched up in the original legislation. If that was impossible-I fail to see why it should have been-it could have done in the Senate with these other amendments. The Government is so far behind in its thinking process in these matters that it cannot accommodate the need for change. Perhaps the Government should consider getting the legislation right in the first place and not have this dog's breakfast approach that we now have to contend with.
       </para>
       <para>
        The APEA made its concerns known; those concerns were available to the Government. Only now, after being hammered in the Senate and being criticised by me in this place, is the Government considering rectifying the concerns of the APEA and the coalition in the Budget session. If nothing else, this shows that the Government is way ahead of the field when it comes to failing to consult with people in industry. That is equally apparent in amendments now before us concerning securities and the Australian Stock Exchange.
       </para>
       <para>
        I do not intend to go through each of the 17 amendments clause by clause. If the Government does not have the decency to have the relevant Minister in here, after the coalition has moved amendments in the Senate, to give us reasons for not accepting them I suppose we could be forgiven for letting the Government stew in its own juice. And stew it will.
       </para>
       <para>
        In much of the legislation before us, as amended first by the Bill and now by the schedule of Senate amendments, there will have to be further change. In some cases, that has already been acknowledged by the Parliamentary Secretary Assisting the Treasurer (Senator McMullan).
       </para>
       <para>
        This is, and continues to be, a disgraceful state of affairs. The guillotine has been applied ruthlessly on important legislation which imposes tax obligations on many hundreds of thousands of Australians. When the Government is forced to change that legislation, as a result of the assiduous work of Senator Watson and some of my other colleagues in the Senate, it does not even have the decency to have the Minister responsible for the legislation in the House. I repeat: it is a disgraceful state of affairs.

         â€”The amendments moved by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs (Mr Tickner) are essentially technical and flow from a report of the Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills presented to the Senate. The Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Amendment Bill was not dealt with at quite the same rushed pace as a lot of the other legislation we have dealt with over the last few weeks. The Bill is an illustration of the value of having a technical scrutiny of Bills being finally dealt with by the Parliament. I mention that with some satisfaction as I was the progenitor of the Scrutiny of Bills Committee.

        I draw to the attention of the Committee of the Whole the fact that, on a non-political and generally bipartisan basis, Bills such as this are submitted to technical examination by a committee which has the assistance of counsel. As often occurs, some technical defect is found. I welcome the fact that the Committee exists; that it made the recommendation; that the recommendation was supported by the Government; and that the amendment was put forward.

        The legislation which has come before us in the last few days is a very good example of the dangers of the sausage machine approach, the pressured approach, which is very often a feature of dealings in this House. I enter a plea for a chance to give legislation more careful and more timely consideration. On behalf of the Opposition, I welcome any attempt by the Parliament to avoid doubts and uncertainties in the law. I think the doubts and uncertainties which exist with respect to the standard of proof in the particular clause which is dealt with by the amendment are well out of the way. For that reason, I support the motion.

Under the recently introduced migration rules, as from that date a two-year conditional resident's permit can be granted to a person who has entered into a formal marriage or de facto relationship with an Australian citizen or resident.
       </para>
       <para>
        The proposed change would allow special benefits to be paid to such persons and, if necessary, backdated to the commencement date of the new rule. It must be presumed that applicants for such conditional entry permits and, indeed, the overwhelming proportion of migrants to this country are able-bodied citizens who are entering Australia with adequate means of support and who will make a constructive contribution to this community. To allow newly arrived migrants immediately to receive social security income support sends precisely the wrong signal to prospective entrants. The impression should not be created that Australia will provide a haven for those who cannot pay their own way in other countries.
       </para>
       <para>
        We believe there is no justification for offering welfare payments to people who come to this country on what is, in a sense, a probationary basis. We therefore proposed that these relevant clauses be removed from the Bill but, sadly, the Government and the Democrats did not support us in that regard. However, these other amendments are merely correcting drafting errors and improving arrangements in relation to the eligibility for a fringe benefits card as a result of the deeming provisions and they have the Opposition's support.

        <para in-line="1">
         â€”The Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Amendment Bill has the support of the Opposition as far as it goes. I have recently been advised that the Government proposes to introduce further amendments during the committee stage. In a sense, one might draw a slightly different lesson from the fact that the Bill is to be amended before it even passes through this Parliament from the lesson we might have drawn from the frequency of amendments over recent times. Most of those amendments arise from the fact that legislation has been rushed through this House and, where the Government can do it, rushed through the Senate. As a result, the legislation is often defective.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I think in the case of the present legislation the need to amend the Bill before it actually passes into law also reflects the fact that this is a shifting scene, that the issues of how we best protect Australia's and the world's wildlife are issues that are still being developed. I hope in this speech to deal with some of the directions that are required. I think this is a fairly fluid situation; I think it should be a fluid situation because I and, indeed, the Opposition are not satisfied that the legislative framework and the international framework we have in place so far are necessarily the best way to protect our wildlife, particularly our endangered species.
       </para>
       <para>
        As far as the detail of the Bill is concerned, it increases custodial penalties from five to 10 years for wildlife smuggling; it tightens the definition in the Act to prevent importers using Australia as a holding area while they arrange markets in other countries; and it restricts to six the maximum number of household pets people may take with them when leaving Australia-this avoids people moving in and out of Australia as a subterfuge for carrying large quantities of Australian wildlife; and it gives the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories greater flexibility in determining whether to allow trade in certain common species without the need for a management plan.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is this aspect of the Bill that has caused some disquiet amongst those people who have an interest in this area and where the Government will be moving regulations to make it clear that it is not proposing either a degree of flexibility that is unwise or to move without an appropriate opportunity for public consultation.
       </para>
       <para>
        I think in explaining our support for the Bill it is worth referring to the coalition's environment policy in the form in which it was published in February 1990. We expressed our strong support for the Act and specifically called for stronger penalties. The Opposition policy states:
       </para>
       <para>
        The Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act 1982 will be kept up to date, the penalties under it increased and more resources devoted to its enforcement. The States will be encouraged to introduce complementary legislation to support this regime.
       </para>
       <para>
        I interpolate here that at the moment the Commonwealth Government is under great pressure not just from the Opposition but from organisations concerned about Australia's wildlife to do what our policy says, which is to have more resources devoted to the enforcement of the law. Our policy goes on:
       </para>
       <para>
        The Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) will be supported fully and Australia will play a more active role in its further development.
       </para>
       <para>
        We will continue to cooperate with the excellent work done by TRAFFIC.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is, the Trade Records Analysis of Flora and Fauna in Commerce. That is our existing policy. Clearly this Bill in a substantial sense is in accord with that. I would, however, like to quote another section of our policy to which I wish to devote the major part of my remarks. At an earlier stage we say:
       </para>
       <para>
        The Liberal and National Parties will maintain the current prohibition on the export of native birds but will subject this matter to re-examination on our election to Government. We recognise the damage done frequently to crops and property by some species of native birds and will encourage research into more effective methods of controlling these birds and reducing such loss and damage.
       </para>
       <para>
        The broad points I want to canvass tonight are the views that, with respect to species that are in profusion, and indeed at times in plague proportion, there are significant arguments being advanced not just within Australia but elsewhere that there is need for management programs that permit the trade in those species. At a time when Australian farmers are suffering mightily from economic pressures, many of them see a certain illogicality in being permitted to slaughter very substantial numbers of birds but being denied the right to trade in those birds. There is a lack of logic in the fact that, as I was advised by some of the departmental advisers and by people involved in the field, birds may be netted and crushed to death, yet the law prohibits their being exported and some value being obtained from them.
       </para>
       <para>
        With respect to those species that are at the other end of the spectrum, those that are endangered, there are also significant arguments, which I hope to canvass briefly in this debate, that perhaps the best method of dealing with them and protecting them for the future and ensuring their survival is not through a system of statutory prohibitions but by giving people a vested interested in their survival. I will go into that in a little more detail, but I think it is pretty obvious that any animal that has a domestic value is not an animal that is going to be in danger of extinction. We have about 170 million sheep in Australia. One could not get a more vulnerable animal than a sheep, but the fact is that we bred them up in profusion because at the time there was value in doing so.
       </para>
       <para>
        There are so many valuable lessons to be drawn from the African continent in terms of wildlife management that suggest that where the peoples of the country concerned get a legitimate economic interest in the preservation of the species, then the species is likely to be enhanced, to survive because people will protect it so that they can protect their own economic interests. Unfortunately, in those jurisdictions where the reliance is on prohibition, it often occurs that the people, who may be poverty stricken, have a vested interest in assisting the poachers, and one gets the most frightful destruction of game even though there are serious laws that protect them.
       </para>
       <para>
        So the Opposition policy is to look at alternative means of protecting native Australian wildlife. We have committed ourselves, and our support of this Bill is part of that commitment, to supporting the present Government's efforts in the existing legislation. But we flag the need for the consideration of alternative approaches that might be more productive. Before going on to deal with those in a little more detail, I would like to acknowledge the important role of non-government organisations in pursuing the objectives of preserving Australia's and the world's wildlife. I have already referred to TRAFFIC, which is a body supported by the World Wildlife Fund (WWF) Australia. We specifically in our policy support their work and say we will continue to cooperate with them. I renew that commitment here tonight.
       </para>
       <para>
        Beyond that, however, there has been sensible collaboration or at least sensible communication between those bodies, that is, WWF and TRAFFIC, and the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service, between those bodies and the Minister's office, with the Opposition, with Greenpeace and with the Australian Conservation Foundation. I find increasingly that I am getting direct representations from members of the farming community as well, many of whom are actively engaged in preserving both plant and animal species-as far as plants are concerned through programs like the remnant vegetation program-with an increasing interest in seeing the preservation of threatened wildlife. The work of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation in that regard is a very valuable contribution.
       </para>
       <para>
        I think this is an area where, when we look at all those bodies, we see one of the emerging pluses of the broader concern about the environment. We find here a substantial involvement of people who perhaps have traditionally been at odds but find themselves with a common objective and a preparedness to cooperate.
       </para>
       <para>
        The National Farmers Federation, which tries to represent the often quite disparate views of farmers, responds to the economic problem that I referred to earlier and to the apparent illogicality of birds being poisoned or otherwise disposed of when they might have some commercial value. These are birds which are in profusion. One sees, in the way that these issues are developing in Australia-whether in the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service or among the non-government organisations-a growing sense that we need to canvass other matters.
       </para>
       <para>
        I draw attention also to an extraordinary aspect of this matter, which is comparatively recent, in my experience-that is, the international campaign. Late last year I first started receiving correspondence from people in the United States who were urging an end to the practice of destroying birds rather than allowing a legitimate trade in them. I recently received a series of letters dated 2 June which were addressed not to me but to someone called `Senator Ros Kelly, the Australian Minister for the Environment'. That is how they are addressed. It is not one of my customary flips; they are actually addressed to her in that capacity-no doubt a hangover from Senator Richardson's days.
       </para>
       <para>
        These have come from a group called `A Safe Alternative' from Grand Rapids in Michigan. I will pass on the 137 letters which have been sent care of me, which apparently are a part of 4,800 individual letters of protest and 15,350 signatures on petitions from the United States, which call upon the Government to reconsider policy in this area. They refer to four particular species-rose breasted galahs, bare eyed corellas, slender billed corellas and greater sulphur crested cockatoos-and say that these species are being slaughtered by methods such as shooting, poisoning, explosives and gassing. The letter reads:
       </para>
       <para>
        I believe these birds should be selectively culled under a sound approved management program, by trappers, under State Government control, used as a resource, and an overseas export industry established.
       </para>
       <para>
        It would be possible to have a very wide-ranging debate on this matter. In the autumn 1991 edition of the Commission for the Future's magazine 1C there is an interview with Peter Singer, who is well known to people who are concerned with policy in this area. I do not wish to go into Peter Singer's views at length because I am not familiar with them in great detail. But I was struck by the complexity of these areas and the philosophical issues which he raises.
       </para>
       <para>
        He talks about the spreading circle of concern that will include animals and refers to the blatant racism which once used to permit people to accept the herding of black people from Africa into ships as slaves, their death-many of them dying en route-and their treatment as animals and beasts of burden and as the chattels of people. He refers to that as something of the past, something that we have cast aside. He talks about the fact that we continue to treat animals in a way that we once treated people and suggests that the attitudes are changing and should change. I do not wish to canvass that in detail because I do not think time permits tonight-for me, anyway-but I think those issues, which are capturing a degree of popular support, raise very serious questions when we look at the difficulties of feeding the world and at the feeding habits of most of the world, which often involve the consumption of fish, birds and animals.
       </para>
       <para>
        The thoughts which lie behind the animal liberation movement and some of the issues which are of very serious concern to the rural industries in Australia need to be considered carefully and put into proper perspective. I put that forward at this stage as a caution and as something which makes this an even more complex debate.
       </para>
       <para>
        In referring to some of the difficulties involved, I move to some of the thinking which was developed within Australia by international bodies as recently as last December. I also want to refer quickly to the book On Wildlife ``Conservation'' by Ron Thomson, who is from South Africa. Perhaps one will be permitted to quote South African authors in these days of some political thaw, following the attempted dismantling of apartheid. I think it is interesting to look at some of the propositions that he develops.
       </para>
       <para>
        He writes very effectively about the need to ensure that the rural people of Africa support conservation rather than poaching. He suggests that poaching cannot be crushed by the imposition of legal constraints, because that tends to lead to both avoidance of the law and corruption. I commend Mr Thomson's publication to those who are interested in the field. I think it is a very powerful argument in favour of making sure that the economic incentives are in favour of maintenance of the species rather than its destruction.
       </para>
       <para>
        He makes the point powerfully in this book that the primary cause of loss of species is loss of habitat. He says that the pressing population problems in Africa and elsewhere mean that habitat will be under ever greater threat and, whilst there may be 1.3 million elephants in Africa at the time of writing, much of the habitat is under threat and that is as great a threat as poaching. I think it is important to ensure that the preservation of habitats can be afforded by the countries concerned and their citizens.
       </para>
       <para>
        In chapter 40 he deals with birds. He refers to the capture and sale of wild birds as having been an emotive issue for many years and one that needs an in-depth review. He puts forward the view that they are a renewable natural source, like other wild creatures and domestic animals. He says:
       </para>
       <para>
        They are a product of the land and there is no valid reason why they should not be harvested like other animals for the benefit of man.
       </para>
       <para>
        I understand that these propositions will be regarded as contentious by many people in the environmental field. My appeal in this debate is for a sober analysis of the factual situation rather than a simple knee-jerk reaction.
       </para>
       <para>
        We have to decide what it is that we are seeking to preserve, knowing that, as the report of the Brundtland World Commission on Environment and Development points out, we have a human world of some five billion people which, in the words of that report, `will have to make room for another five billion people'. In those circumstances, the pressures on habitat will be enormous. We do need to find ways which make it realistic to expect that substantial areas will be preserved to preserve species.
       </para>
       <para>
        Why should we preserve species? I think that is a matter on which there would be broad agreement within this chamber. The loss of genetic material, be it plant or animal, reduces the capacity of the world to adjust to future change and to evolve. There are significant values in maintaining the range of genetic material as far as is possible. For that reason, these are not issues of mere emotion; they are issues of intense practicality for the future, as well issues that raise important philosophical questions of the sort that people such as Peter Singer raise. More and more people are querying the view that we treat animals, or any form of life, as something which is simply expendable. How does one marry that with the need more and more to utilise these resources so that people may lead more human lives?
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr Thomson, in the chapter in his book about birds, says:
       </para>
       <para>
        The manner and control of that harvest, however, requires the employment of competent people, who can humanely catch and properly market the product. If such an industry is to be successful, however, it is imperative that legal bird catchers be supported by wildlife management agencies and, in turn, the bird catchers, must support the philosophies and policies of those agencies. In other words it needs co-operation on both sides. It also needs proper control, which is the administrative responsibility of the wildlife management agency itself.
       </para>
       <para>
        For those people who feel that any talk of this sort is inhumane and shows a carelessness about the preservation of species, I can only say that I think it is important to remember how brutal nature itself is.
       </para>
       <para>
        The last strong rains in central Australia saw the most amazing profusion of bird life, including pelicans, in central Australia. I saw the most splendid photographs, though I did not have the benefit of going out to see it. There was a most amazing sight of tens of thousands of pelicans and other waterfowl on and around Lake Eyre. The advice that I received on that was that the bulk of those birds would die-literally tens of thousands would die; I think one estimate was 80,000 pelicans, but the precise number does not matter.
       </para>
       <para>
        The fact is that in this extraordinary and unusual cycle of nature there was a profusion of life and then an enormous number wiped out. I fail to see that the issues of proper management programs of wildlife which will guarantee that it will be sustained in the future represent any more brutal a regime than the regime which is imposed by nature itself. All of that in a sense is by way of preface to what I think is the very cheering reality of the direction in which things are moving.
       </para>
       <para>
        We in Australia were the hosts to the international environment union; the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) conference was held in Perth in December of last year. That is the largest gathering of environmental bodies that is held in the world; it represents a great collection of both government and non-government organisations and it represents the gathering together of interests which are substantially concerned with the maintenance of bio-diversity, with the maintenance of a world which will be livable for all of its species, not least for mankind. I must say that I was most impressed by the opening remarks of the President of IUCN when he made the point-and I may not quote him exactly, but I would be close to exact in saying this-`We will only be taken seriously in these matters when we show that we care for people as much as we care for penguins'. I thought it a most salutary reminder at the beginning of a substantial conference on environment: that to ignore the human element is extremely foolish and ultimately futile.
       </para>
       <para>
        One of the good things which came out of the IUCN conference, once one got beyond the initial theatre-and I separate this from the theatre of the first few days, which I must say I thought was something of a waste of some of the taxpayers' funds that went into it as there seemed to be more theatre than substance-and got into the working parties on issues such as bio-diversity, was that there was, I think, incredibly valuable work being put forward.
       </para>
       <para>
        Tonight, I simply want to refer to the material that was put forward and the ultimate resolution of the IUCN, 18/24, headed `Conservation Of Wildlife Through Wise Use As A Renewable Natural Resource'. I regret that the procedures of this chamber do not permit as much incorporation of material as in the other place, because I would quite like to see the whole text of this available to anyone who might refer to Hansard. Whilst I am familiar with the abuses and extraordinary provisions that apply in, say, the United States Congress, I would simply put the personal view that at times it would, in fact, I think, assist the capacity of this chamber to contribute to public debate if things like this two-page resolution could be incorporated, but I do not seek to do so. I seek at some later time, Mr Speaker, to change your mind about the procedures.

         â€”Thank you, Mr Speaker, but that might take longer. Let me refer, first of all, to some of the introductory comments which, in the way that these international organisations proceed, are what we would regard as the substantive resolution which was put forward. The resolution in part says:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        NOTING that some member countries successfully conserve many species of their wildlife resources without using them consumptively, and that in many other countries the use of wildlife is necessary for the wellbeing of their people;
       </para>
       <para>
        RECALLING that two fundamental aims of the World Conservation Strategy are to ensure the conservation of species and ecosystems both for their intrinsic value and for the benefit of humankind-
       </para>
       <para>
        So I interpolate picking up both, if we like, the philosophic or spiritual value of these things as well as their utility; it goes on to say:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . that the mission of the IUCN is to provide leadership and promote a common approach for the world conservation movement in order to safeguard the integrity and diversity of the natural world . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        It recognises the problem of ensuring its sustainable use and is conscious of the roles of different people. It continues:
       </para>
       <para>
        UNDERSTANDING that a country's lands (including its rivers, wetlands, and territorial seas) are fundamental assets due to their potential for producing food and other natural products and that there are economic and humanitarian constraints on the extent to which they can be maintained as natural habitats;
       </para>
       <para>
        RECOGNISING that more effective mechanisms must be found that contribute toward the future economies of countries through wise use and conservation of their renewable natural resources;
       </para>
       <para>
        CONCERN that species' decline and loss of genetic diversity are often due to loss of suitable habitat and exploitation at levels that cannot be sustained;
       </para>
       <para>
        And I think most importantly it goes on to say this:
       </para>
       <para>
        BELIEVING that properly managed projects for the sustainable use of wildlife can enhance the conservation of wildlife populations and their ecosystems because of the economic and other benefits that such use provides.
       </para>
       <para>
        Again I interpolate and move away from the document. We already in Australia-and I had contact with this in my early work as Minister for Aboriginal Affairs-see the farming of crocodiles. I remember visiting Edward River and being glad that I was only looking through the fence. Of course, again in Aboriginal Affairs, I had contact with some early attempts to farm emus. I think that in Australian terms there could be a lot done for the Australian landscape if we farmed native animals more than the exotic animals which trample with their cloven hooves over most of our paddocks and outback. But it is, I think, important to see that at the international level, at what might be called the most active conservation-minded level, there is this recognition that properly managed projects for the sustainable use of wildlife can enhance the conservation of wildlife populations and their ecosystems because of the economic and other benefits that such use provides. The document then goes on to record:
       </para>
       <para>
        The General Assembly of IUCN, at its 18th Session in Perth, Australia, 28 November-5 December 1990:
       </para>
       <para>
        1. AFFIRMS that ethical, wise and sustainable use of some wildlife can provide an alternative or supplementary means of productive land use, and can be consistent with and encourage conservation, where such use is in accordance with adequate safeguards-
       </para>
       <para>
        It then goes on to list four safeguards which are eminently sensible and which the Opposition agrees with and supports. It states:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . sound, scientifically-based monitoring mechanisms to ensure that such use is maintained at levels which can be sustained . . . compliance with national and international legal obligations . . . provision for the protection of wild animals from avoidable cruelty and suffering;
       </para>
       <para>
        We would apply that to any animals which are being utilised by man. It then refers to guidelines which will be developed in more detail later in the document. The document goes on to urge all countries to:
       </para>
       <para>
        establish an adequate system of protected areas . . . consider whether such sustainable use programmes, based on the IUCN guidelines . . . would create economic and other incentives for the retention, rehabilitation, and management of natural habitats and their biological assemblages outside of such protected areas;
       </para>
       <para>
        Again-and I do not have time to deal with it all-the resolution goes on to suggest that:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . the Director General in consultation with the Chairman of the Species Survival Commission . . . develop guidelines based and implemented on scientific, socio-economic, and traditional knowledge-
       </para>
       <para>
        And so on. I have made lengthy reference to that because, as I have said in other debates, I think that the environmental debate in this country during the 1980s was unnecessarily divisive. I think that, when we look at what is happening in this area, there is a coming together of quite disparate groups of people who are finding areas of common interest, and I think that that is very important.
       </para>
       <para>
        I think the fundamental things which will drive the realities as against driving the debate over the generation or so that lies ahead-and it is hard for any of us to look ahead more than that-are the pressure of population and the demand, in Africa, southern America and in the balance of Asia which remains to be rescued from poverty, for increased economic activity. We see in Thailand real abuses of the trade in wildlife, and I think that it really is incumbent upon us to come to this issue in a positive and constructive way and to find proper economic outlets which are consistent with the maintenance of species, consistent with the proper treatment of species and various birds and animals about which we are concerned, but which provide a positive option for the vast part of the world population which still leads, in our terms, lives which are less than we would regard as human.
       </para>
       <para>
        So I think one needs to look at these things in a very holistic way. I think that it is very easy to grab a small piece of this problem and to hare off and be very enthusiastic and, indeed, very righteous about it. I am greatly encouraged by IUCN preparedness to look at this in what is a broader social and economic context, without in any way trading off the importance of maintaining species, maintaining bio-diversity in a hard pressed world. I commend the Bill but suggest that it is but a very small step in what is a very important journey that we have yet to undertake.

It is obvious that he has given great consideration to this matter. However, I cannot agree with him when he says that the environment debate of the 1980s was unnecessarily divisive.

         â€”No, I cannot. It is a sort of pleasure to walk in here, where there is almost no-one to touch me and I can speak freely, though not at length, on this less contentious issue.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I am grateful to the members of the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service for the information which they have been able to provide for me in this debate. It seems to me that we are witnessing a period when courts, for instance, are imposing very heavy fines upon persons who illegally export wildlife. I mention this to illustrate that as a government we are not totally against the export of wildlife and, in appropriate situations, we support well-managed commercial exports of wildlife products, but not live species, so long as their export is not detrimental to the status of the species involved in the export.
       </para>
       <para>
        I think it is valuable to read a list of some examples of export industries currently approved under the provisions of the Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act 1982, and they are as varied as these: under the management programs, for instance, there are export examples of kangaroos in a number of States-Queensland, New South Wales, South Australia and Western Australia; crocodiles in the Northern Territory; bush possums in Tasmania; mutton birds and tree ferns and bull kelp in Tasmania; and wildflowers from Western Australia. Under the category of captive breeding, we allow the export of crocodiles, which is a Queensland program; emus, Western Australia and Queensland programs; clams, a Queensland program; butterflies and beetles, red claw, prawns and freshwater fish from Queensland as well as from New South Wales.
       </para>
       <para>
        We also allow the artificial propagation of plants from various nurseries under the Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act. In exceptional circumstances we allow the export of the following items: sea-shells, plant foliage, flowers, non-commercial household pets such as cockatoos, and seaweed, sphagnum moss and snake venom.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is quite a debate, of course, about how we should handle the problem of pest birds-native pests-and whether or not we should allow the live export of such native birds. To give an example, the birds most frequently referred to as pests which should be exported are the galah, the little corella, the long-billed corella and the sulphur-crested cockatoo. Depending on the species and the State or Territory in which they are found, the birds have a varying degree of protection and most States protect all of the above species but will issue permits for the killing or capture of birds which are causing damage to property. I note that the poisoning of birds is illegal in most States.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is an argument that export will reduce the pest problem, but that argument is not as simple or as obvious as it appears. We find that where these birds are a problem they may occur in large numbers, as they form huge flocks in some seasons-in fact, this is one of the factors considered to make them potential pests-but trapping for export alone would not take large enough numbers in any one year or region to mitigate the impact of these so-called pest birds or the pest problem.
       </para>
       <para>
        Continued trapping could have an impact, depending on the level of trapping. However, the populations being trapped, we argue, will be added to by birds migrating from other areas and by young birds which would otherwise not survive. It is also doubtful whether the profits obtained from exporting the birds would continue long enough for the activity to be a long term solution.
       </para>
       <para>
        So exporting birds, we think, is not a solution to the pest problem, and we note that neither Canada nor the United States of America uses this as a means of controlling bird caused crop losses. In Sri Lanka, where the rose-ringed parakeet has the reputation as the most destructive pest of rice paddies, capture for the pet trade has proved a wholly ineffective control measure and is now discouraged because much rarer species are caught and sold under the pretext of harvesting rose-ringed parakeets.
       </para>
       <para>
        In closing, I refer to some notes we also have on the financial costs and benefits of exporting live species. We are aware that most studies which have looked at the value of the damage caused by birds conclude that, while there may be considerable damage in some years and on individual properties, the average cost on a regional level is insignificant, particularly when compared with the cost of damage inflicted by other agricultural pests.
       </para>
       <para>
        For example, the average consumption of seed, including sunflower, by galahs and sulphur-crested cockatoos in two regions of New South Wales in 1978 represented between a $2 and $285 loss per property when averaged over each region. Most studies indicate losses of the order of 1 to 5 per cent for birds which feed on the ripening grain.
       </para>
       <para>
        The export earning potential of the birds as pets is doubtful. While at the moment these birds are valuable overseas, their cost in Australia is much less. We have three examples. The value of the sulphur-crested cockatoos in Australia, as at April 1989, was $100 each; in the United States of America (USA), using 1988 figures, they are $US1,200 to $US2,000 each; and in New Zealand they are $US750 each, using October 1989 figures. The galah, for instance, is valued in Australia at $15 each, using April 1989 figures; but in the USA at $US1,500 to $US3,000 each on December 1987 figures; and in New Zealand $US1,000 each on October 1989 figures. The long-billed corella is similarly much cheaper here, at only $30 each on April 1989 figures; but in the USA $US1,500 to $US3,000 each on December 1987 figures; and in New Zealand $US5,000 a pair on October 1989 figures. Similar species of birds, such as the Indian ring-necked parrot, which are exported to the United States of America have little commercial value and no current known value, but were valued in the mid-1980s at between $12 and $30.
       </para>
       <para>
        Our argument runs that while the first few shipments of any of these animals could provide huge profits to the exporters, the value of future shipments would be greatly reduced. If Australia allowed such a trade and monitored it properly, the costs of a large-scale exporting industry would far outweigh the value of the birds. The costs would include trapping and providing suitable cages, holding areas, quarantine facilities and transportation, as well as government inspection and supervision. To increase their profit margins the exporters, it seems to us, would in time want to include other, rarer species which are worth a great deal more overseas.
       </para>
       <para>
        So, yes, there is argument about whether or not we should free up the export of so-called pest species. My view is that we need to exercise some caution in these matters and that currently our program of export industries under the Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act is sufficient. I have every confidence in supporting this motion.

         â€”Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, for the opportunity to speak on what is really a very important Bill. It is one that has a tinge of disappointment hanging over it because it was introduced on 22 August 1990-and we are indeed talking about endangered species of many different kinds-and it is not until half way through the following year that the Bill actually comes into the House for the implementation of very important amendments.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The title of the Bill is the Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Amendment Bill 1990. It is a very important Bill, as was said by the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly) in her second reading speech and by speakers since, not least by far the honourable member for Pearce (Mr Chaney). As shadow Minister, he very eloquently spelt out the Opposition's views on the importance of this Bill and he detailed some of our reservations about it.
       </para>
       <para>
        The purpose of the Bill is to allow the Minister to exempt the export or import of certain plant and animal specimens from the controls attached to an approved management program and increase the maximum prison term that may be imposed for the unauthorised import or export of certain plant and animal specimens. The Bill will also allow the Minister to make a declaration approving and imposing a time frame or conditions on a management program and clarifying the treatment of certain plant and animal specimens in transit. The Bill amends the Wildlife Protection Act 1982, to which I referred earlier and which regulates the import and export of fauna and flora.
       </para>
       <para>
        Australia is a party to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, known as CITES, and co-operates with another very important organisation called TRAFFIC, or Trade Records Analysis of Flora and Fauna in Commerce. As well as increasing penalties for illegal actions, the Bill contains changes aimed at increasing the efficiency and effectiveness of legitimate trade in wildlife and related products.
       </para>
       <para>
        As you would know, Mr Deputy Speaker, I represent one of the most magnificent electorates in the world, even in the universe-the electorate of Macquarie. From Wiseman's Creek way up in the Oberon area to Wiseman's Ferry, which is almost the eastern extremity of my electorate, there abounds an environment of absolute magnificence, through the Hawkesbury, the Blue Mountains, the Jenolan Caves area, the Abercrombie Caves area, the Oberon Plateau, not to mention the great grasslands of Burraga and Black Springs, where the rosellas and many other seed-eating parrots abound. A number of them are coming within the endangered species area.
       </para>
       <para>
        Whether endangered or not, those birds are native to this country and they are a magnificent part of the scenery, particularly in the Blue Mountains, where there are rainbow lorikeets and king parrots, as well as sulphur-crested white cockatoos in abundance. There are people who wish that we could export some of those, but I will not go into that. At Echo Point in the Blue Mountains, one of the most visited tourist spots in Australia and even in the world, many hundreds of thousands of people each year are entertained by the antics of these beautiful birds and, more importantly, by their magnificent appearance.
       </para>
       <para>
        I pay tribute to the tourism committees and organisations in the Blue Mountains and other areas for the efforts they make to promote the well-being of these birds by providing feed sources and so on for them. This is in contrast to the endangering of some of these species within our own country. This Bill is designed to come to grips with the illegal export of our rarer species, and not so rare in some instances, of bird and animal life. I read with interest a press clipping which said:
       </para>
       <para>
        A recent report by the NSW and Australian National Parks and Wildlife services, the Forestry Commission and Victorian Government authorities identified destruction of the Superb Parrot's habitat as another major problem.
       </para>
       <para>
        The superb parrot, or the green leek parrot, as it is sometimes known, is a very special parrot, a magnificent parrot that has been the subject of much poaching in the past. The New South Wales Government, very much to its credit, in 1988 brought in legislation imposing far stiffer penalties for people caught engaging in poaching activities, and indeed those have come into place. The superb parrot, which occurs in the Young district, in the area represented by the honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Sharp)-a very good member-received a lot of attention. The report to which I referred says that we are endangering these parrots ourselves, and we need to bring that to attention, particularly from the point of view of government. The report said:
       </para>
       <para>
        The parrots usually nest in the hollows of dead trees-
       </para>
       <para>
        as indeed do most parrots-
       </para>
       <para>
        but tree-felling to provide wood for household fires is rapidly reducing the number of nesting sites in the Young area. . .
       </para>
       <para>
        and indeed in many other areas today. That report was made three or four years ago, and I do not think there has been any decrease in the attack being made on the habitat of these beautiful parrots and many others.
       </para>
       <para>
        When we talk about cracking down on bird smugglers and people who poach and engage in the export of other animals as well, we need to bear in mind that we have very serious problems in preserving these endangered species within our own country. I am very pleased to be a part of the Standing Committee on Environment, Recreation and the Arts, which is conducting an inquiry into bio-diversity, and that will consider some aspects of endangered species.
       </para>
       <para>
        I should like to re-emphasise some aspects of the coalition's policy on this very matter. The coalition's environment policy document, which was issued in February of last year, strongly supports the Act we are amending tonight and endorses those amendments. It calls specifically for stronger penalties, and we all endorse those. The policy says:
       </para>
       <para>
        The Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act 1982 will be kept up to date-
       </para>
       <para>
        and indeed it will-
       </para>
       <para>
        the penalties under it increased . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        We were putting this on the basis that we were going to win government, and we almost did, but we are glad to see that the Government has taken on board our policies and the recommendations of the New South Wales Government and has done something about the need to increase these penalties. Our policy also states that we will devote more resources to enforcement. I notice in the digest on this Bill that the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service maintains a record of all seizures and surrenders of plant and animal specimens made under the provisions of the principal Act.
       </para>
       <para>
        The unfortunate thing about this list is that it would include items that were voluntarily surrendered. A high percentage of these items listed would not have been seized through proper searches and proper accountability by the Customs officers. People could have left the country unnoticed when they should have been noticed. Among the list of seizures and surrenders are: live birds, 127; live reptiles, 125; live fish, 81; live crabs, 6; plants, 708; turtle products, 401; and butterfly specimens, 375. These are mostly taken possession of by Customs and other officials after they have been declared and the person's luggage has been checked as a result of that declaration.
       </para>
       <para>
        As I said, the policy of the coalition is very strongly in support of this whole Act and this amendment tonight, as the honourable member for Pearce pointed out. We are very supportive of the Convention of International Trade in Endangered Species of Fauna and Flora. That is supported fully. I hope that Australia will play a more active role in its further development during the period of this Government and when the new government comes into office in 1993.
       </para>
       <para>
        As I mentioned earlier, we will continue to cooperate with the excellent work that has been done by TRAFFIC. I commend the New South Wales Minister for the Environment, Mr Tim Moore, who is a very active and effective Minister, for the work that he did in 1988 as a member of the Greiner Government. The Government promised that it would double the penalties for smuggling birds and animals from five years to 10 years. That was done. On that occasion, the State Government called for the Commonwealth to step up its enforcement efforts. I hope that the Minister will make every effort to ensure that there is an increase in the capacity of Customs officers and other officials of the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service which will enable them to enforce this legislation and implement this amendment far better than they have been able to do in the past.
       </para>
       <para>
        I remind the House of the great need to give our total support to the main tenets of this amendment tonight. It is a very vital piece of legislation. As I said earlier, I am very disappointed that it has taken so long to be debated. Nevertheless, it is here and it has almost unanimous support. I am very happy that I have had the opportunity to speak about the magnificent species that exist throughout my electorate. I am very happy to report that the number of galahs throughout the Macquarie electorate is very small. The Opposition is happy to support this amendment.

         â€”I rise to speak on the Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Amendment Bill at this time because of the delay in getting business back from the Senate. This Bill seeks to increase the penalties for smuggling and, to that extent, it is to be applauded. I think that we ought to have a good look at just what is happening in Australia. Prior to 1960 there was very little smuggling of rare species from Australia. The reason for that was that we had an industry which was controlled. While it is true that the export of rare species is prohibited, there was a trade in common species. When there were large numbers of trappers out in the field, they used to jealously guard their patch. If there was any hint of illegality they would be down on the offender like a proverbial ton of bricks. The police force was far greater than the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service or the States could possibly expect to provide. That should be borne in mind when we are looking at the end results of our actions.

        This legislation which was introduced on 1 January 1961 was brought in at the behest of the RSPCA in Victoria and Melbourne and very little has changed. We still find that pressure groups in society are able to impose their wishes on government, particularly when these pressure groups are urban based and often remote from the realities of life.

        Let us look at the costs of this exercise. In 1958-59, the last year in which the export of animals from Australia was allowed, a company in Perth trading as Ausfauna exported between 7,000 and 8,000 kangaroos mainly of the species Megaleia rufa and Macropus fuliginosus and Macropus robustus. These landed at New York and fetched 125 pounds each in 1958 dollars.

        I refer to the Pearl Coast Zoo in Broome. Those who have seen it will have to agree that it is one of the best zoos in Australia. It is a magnificent zoo. It is, in a sense, a gift from Lord McAlpine to the people of Broome. Lord McAlpine is well known in the world for his interest in zoological matters. This zoo has, in fact, bred very many rare species. It is a sanctuary for these species and the breeding there in some cases is unique. For the first time in the world certain species have been bred in this environment. However, this zoo is running at a considerable loss and, in my view, can never expect to recoup its running costs from entry fees.
       </para>
       <para>
        If this zoo were allowed to export its aviary bred component-they are often very common-it could cover that shortfall and the zoo would survive. As it is, I believe that there is a very real risk that this zoo, for financial reasons, will eventually close. Australia and the world will have lost a facility that is very good at breeding rare species and is playing a large part in the preservation of rare species. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.

        I will spend a little time giving the reasons for the Government's position. The Committee would be aware that the Bills which comprise the wool package, the Wool Tax (Nos 1 to 5) Amendment Bills, were passed in the House on 4 June, and they concern in part the rate of wool tax to apply from 1991-92. Honourable members will also know that the Government decided that the wool tax rate for 1991-92 should be set at 15 per cent, with 11 per cent going to debt reduction, 3.5 per cent to promotion and other purposes and half a per cent to research and development.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is important at the outset to understand that, whilst the level of the tax has been the focus of attention and the reason we are back in this Committee tonight on this issue, the tax itself cannot be separated out as a component part and treated in isolation. It is part of an integral package of reform measures to restructure this industry, and it needs to be seen against the need to retire debt which has been accumulated through a massive stockpile of wool and to do it in a way that, in bringing wool onto the market out of that stockpile, does not depress prices and therefore the returns to growers.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is a simplistic notion in the extreme to argue that reducing the tax from 15 per cent to 10 per cent, as the coalition would have us do, is in some way a benefit to the grower. If one looks at the tax in isolation and as a cost, it means that if the tax is less people pay less, but if the tax is less, then the Australian Wool Realisation Commission has less to operate with. The Commission has to put more wool onto the market, and that in turn depresses the price, which not only reduces returns to growers but also reduces the return off the tax. We get into a ridiculous downward spiral.
       </para>
       <para>
        Having said that, the Government is conscious of the difficulties which face the rural sector at this present time. However, we have a responsibility to take a sensible decision on the rate of wool tax which balances the need to maintain a viable woolgrowing industry whilst at the same time protecting the interests of all taxpayers by ensuring that the Commonwealth's contingent liability for the $2.57 billion debt of the Australian Wool Corporation (AWC) is not called up.
       </para>
       <para>
        As the Government has explained repeatedly, the tax is but one part of an overall strategy for getting rid of the wool stockpile and restructuring the industry on a sound and sustainable basis. Any change to one part of the strategy will place considerable pressure on the other components. The Senate has referred the wool tax Bills back to the House with a request that the maximum rate of tax from July 1991 be 10 per cent. For its part, the Australian Wool Industry Council has made available analyses undertaken on behalf of Acil Australia Pty Ltd which propose a wool tax of 12 per cent. Both these levels of tax are unworkable and have the effect of taking farmers' cash operating surpluses from a positive position, which would pertain under the 15 per cent tax, to a negative position.

         â€”That is the first test. One to me. The point is this: the reason it creates that circumstance is that under the 15 per cent tax there was no requirement on our part, under the original proposal, for wool from the stockpile to be put into the market. That would have resulted, according to our estimate through the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics (ABARE), in market prices at 485c a kilogram. However, if we go to the 12 per cent figure, the requirement for the Realisation Commission to be able to retire the debt in accordance with the schedule which the Cabinet has determined, contingent upon getting access to that $200m, would require putting onto the market 25 kilotonnes of wool, which would reduce the price to 465c a kilogram and take farm cash operating surpluses from a positive to a negative position.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        It is worse under the 10 per cent formula because under that approach one would have to put 46 kilotonnes of wool into the market and further depress the price to 450c a kilogram. The simple point which needs to be understood by people, including the honourable member for O'Connor (Mr Tuckey), is that one just cannot look at the tax as a cost to woolgrowers; one has to look at the impact of the tax and its use to retire the debt and reduce the wool stockpile, and the strategy that relates to that. One has to see it in terms of what it does to the price of wool and, therefore, the end result for growers.

It started with the proposition that the debt is not $2.57 billion but $2.37 billion, because it assumed that the $200m the Government is prepared to put forward can be retired off the debt. I refer honourable members to the media release my predecessor, the current Treasurer (Mr Kerin), put out when this package of proposals was announced. The $200m is available only to facilitate interest free loans over the two years as an advance on the sale of assets, not to retire the debt. The starting point in the analysis which leads people to the conclusion that 10 per cent or 12 per cent is workable is wrong. It is wrong by $200m. If people do not think that is significant in the context of an 11 or 12 per cent rate of interest which has to be found to fund the debt, then they are deluding themselves.

        The debt is $2.57 billion now but whilst it is relevant to stagger that column in the press release in relation to the level of debt outstanding at the end of the period, that is not the critical factor in terms of the restructuring. The critical factor is the level of debt reduction that the Cabinet decision requires the Realisation Commission to meet in order to reduce the stockpile. It is that set of figures, not the absolute level of debt, that is relevant in terms of the adjustments that have to be made sensibly over a period.

I am prepared to concede that the starting level of debt being different, plus the higher realisation on the price, does make a difference. The other factor that has changed is the level of assets sale that can be achieved quickly. In the original proposal we were talking about an order of magnitude of $200m in assets sales. That is what this figure in terms of the interest free loan was about. In calculations that have been done and checked with the Wool Council of Australia-I met with it today-it is accepted that somewhere between only $40m and $50m can be realised in assets sales, not $200m.

It does not gel in terms of any analysis or discussion that has been undertaken with the Corporation, the Council, ABARE or the Department of Primary Industries and Energy. They have to accept the fact that as much as they might like to wish list a position in terms of assets sales to get the debt retirement down earlier, it is not going to happen. They have to base their analysis on real figures in terms of the up-to-date position.

        The loan facility needs to be seen in the context of an overriding government requirement that the Commission will be required to manage the debt so as to reduce the liabilities outstanding at the end of each year by at least the amount required by the announced debt reduction schedule. This too, along with the debt reduction schedule, as I said before, is set out in the statement. It is the relevant column, as distinct from the final statement of debt outstanding.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is because of the way the $200m loan is included in the calculations prepared by Acil Australia Pty Ltd on behalf of the Wool Council of Australia that it is able to derive the lower estimate of the wool tax required to meet the debt schedule than is suggested by the figures available to me and which I have had the opportunity today to take the Deputy Leader of the National Party of Australia, the honourable member for Murray (Mr Lloyd), through.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is against that background that I repeat that the 10 per cent levy proposed by the Opposition in the Senate is unworkable and removed from reality. The so-called balance sheet document tabled in the Senate by the Opposition, on which it relies-arguing that 10 per cent is manageable-makes the same mistake as Acil in the way it treats the $200m. It reflects an unrealistic view of the possible sale of assets of that $120m. It ignores the very depressed state of the commercial property market and the best estimates of the current AWC, which owns and manages the properties now.
       </para>
       <para>
        Does the Opposition really want to force the Corporation, in holding assets on behalf of the woolgrowers of this country, to divest themselves of assets at lower prices than they could realise at a subsequent stage? If it wants to do that, it is not really acting in the interests of the constituency. It does not expect the Corporation to be able to sell more than $40m to $50m of the property in that time. The figures available to me are based on $50m of non-wool asset sales. As well, the Opposition sees stock sales generating some $74m, but the Government's strategy is based on minimal stock sales in 1991-92. The very fact that it is arguing to put more wool on to the market will depress the price. It will reduce returns to growers and that is what it should be telling them. It should tell them the whole picture, because we will.

It has simply tried to argue that the tax is a cost and if it reduces costs they are better off but it has not told them that in reducing the cost it also impacts upon the price that the market will pay for wool because there will be more wool on the market. Therefore, their returns will be reduced.

        When I came to this portfolio I took the view that because there was a lot of angst expressed about this tax and because I had not had a great deal of involvement in it before, I took the trouble not just to go through the figures that had been prepared but to get them analysed and reanalysed. I have spent the best part of the last 48 hours doing that and sitting down exhaustively with people to try to satisfy myself that the calculations that we have put up are the right ones and that those that the Opposition is relying on are the wrong ones. I am satisfied of that.
       </para>
       <para>
        I said at the outset that since the 15 per cent rate was announced on 30 April some factors in the market have changed-I acknowledge that-such as the higher than anticipated prices, some 10 per cent higher, lower production estimates and a lower expected AWC debt at 30 June, but not as low as the Opposition suggests. In the cross-chamber conversation that we had during an earlier division, the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer) acknowledged that the $2.57 billion figure is the correct one, not the figure of $2.37 billion that Acil has been relying upon.
       </para>
       <para>
        However, the problem with any decision to lower the 15 per cent rate from 1 July is that it is based on a lot of big ifs: if prices are better than the expected 475c per kilogram clean next year; if production forecasts are accurate-I have had this discussion with the Deputy Leader of the National Party; I confirmed to him that ABARE's best estimates based on the Committee that advises is still the 881c level of production, not the lower level that the Opposition has been talking about-if economies in our major customer countries perform as we anticipate; and if, as we expect, the AWC can sell a certain amount of its wool stores assets in depressed property markets. They are big ifs and they are real doubts. The trouble is that the Opposition is trying to put the best picture on all of those ifs and in the process it exposes the industry to greater risk.
       </para>
       <para>
        For every one per cent reduction in the wool tax rate in 1991-92 it becomes necessary to sell more wool to meet the debt reduction schedule. It is that schedule that is driving the decision and the commitment that the Government has made. That is the schedule that the Realisation Commission has to operate against. If it cannot get the result on the basis of the level of tax that we want to charge, if it gets less returns and therefore less capacity to retire the debt, it has to put more wool on the market to achieve it. In the process of putting more wool on the market it can only reduce the price. The Opposition has to understand that equation and it has to be honest with the constituency, with rural Australia, the woolgrowers of this country, in telling them of that interaction between the tax and the ultimate returns to growers.
       </para>
       <para>
        The more wool that is sold from the stockpile, the more prices are reduced and it impacts on growers' incomes. There therefore is a trade-off in terms of grower incomes between the level of the tax and the depressing effect on prices on stockpile sales. Analysis has shown that farm cash income in the short term is lower under a low tax and high stock release strategy compared with a higher tax and lower stock release strategy.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the final analysis this is really the revealing set of figures because it is the difference between the receipts available to the Wool Realisation Commission in the first year and the costs incurred by that Commission. As far as the costs are concerned, I think it is clear-as everyone will acknowledge-that we have to fund the $2.57 billion debt, which will cost in the order of $283m in the year, based on figures that I understand the Wool Council and ABARE now agree to.
       </para>
       <para>
        In addition to the $283m that has to be found, another $20m is required for administration, $32.5m for stock holding costs and $14m for redundancies over and above those contingently provided for in Corporation's funds. That is a total set of costs of $349.5m, or close to $350m. In terms of tax receipts-this interaction between what the tax yields and what the wool going onto the market does in terms of the lowering of prices-do honourable members know what a 10 per cent tax yields? It yields $155m of that $350m.

I said that if there were to be negotiations below it-which I did not agree to-there had to be a 15 per cent cap. While I was prepared to argue that we would not go above 14 per cent in the future, I could not guarantee that if it were less than 14 per cent it would not have to go up next year. I know, because I have spoken with them, that the last thing the Wool Council and the National Farmers Federation-and I-want is to set a tax that we have to increase next time. I think all honourable members would accept that. We have to pitch realistically now on the basis that we get it down as quickly as we can. However, we should not pitch recklessly; we pitch realistically. That is why I was prepared to offer 14 per cent, but that figure was rejected.

        I indicated that I was prepared to try to negotiate a sensible and prudent operative level for the wool tax to apply for the year; that figure was somewhat below the 15 per cent and, as I said, I had offered 14 per cent but it was not taken up. Against that background the Government is not moving that; the Government is saying that the Opposition needs to assess its position and to understand the position it is forcing: that by trying to get through the Senate a level of taxation that is unsustainable in terms of the restructuring of this industry, it is jeopardising the rest of the package and the legislative framework by which the debt will be reduced, by which the new marketing arrangements can be entered into, by which the new research and development facilities can be introduced and by which new participants in terms of the broad structures of the Corporation and the other two bodies will be developed.

        It would have been easy for this Government to agree to the 10 per cent or 12 per cent simply to get the wool package through the Parliament, but it would have been irresponsible because it would not have been in the best interests of the wool industry. Attached to that is the high probability that the wool industry will lose and will incur further debt. That is what the Opposition is proposing by the nonsense position of 10 per cent, maybe 12 per cent. The Government is not prepared to play games with the future of this industry and with the livelihood of woolgrowers in this country. Therefore the Government rejects the Senate's request for a 10 per cent wool tax and returns the Wool Tax (Nos 1 to 5) Amendment Bills to the Senate as they stand.
       </para>
       <para>
        I hope both this chamber and the Senate recognise that if the Senate persists with its current attitude and fails to pass the package of wool industry Bills before it, the Government will have no option but to have the industry continue to operate under the Wool Marketing Act 1987, with the reserve price scheme in suspension under the Wool Marketing (Temporary Provisions) Amendment Act, which was passed by the Parliament earlier this year. The Parliament needs to realise that in such circumstances 25 per cent remains the operative rate of wool tax.

        I do not know whether the Government means to do it this way-it seems an odd policy for the Government to adopt-but by having a 15 per cent tax, the Government will help the big graziers and will force out the small growers. Is that the sort of adjustment that this so-called equity Labor Government wants to have? The first year is critical and in the first year the tax will be 15 per cent. If it does force out many woolgrowers, as presumably the Government wants as part of this draconian adjustment scheme-both for woolgrowers and for towns in the grazing areas of Australia-it will reduce the tax base for later years and make it harder for those left in the industry to meet the continuing demands of this Government.

It has been shifting-quite frankly, it is shifty as well as shifting-because firstly we had a $200m loan. I quote from the second reading speech of the former Minister for Primary Industries and Energy, the Treasurer (Mr Kerin), on 30 April:
        </para>
       </talk.start>

       <para>
        In view of the state of the present real estate market, in order to give the Commission time to get the maximum value out of the property sales, the Commonwealth will facilitate a $200m interest-free loan over two years as an advance on the sale of the assets.

       <para>
        Nothing in that statement, and nothing in further statements by Minister Kerin, indicated that a $200m loan would not be made up front to the industry in recognition of this so-called difficulty in selling the assets. The Australian Wool Corporation (AWC) had presumably checked with the Department and the Minister's office and found at a later stage that the $200m had become, in its understanding and I believe also that of the Wool Council, a $22m interest payment-that is, 11 per cent on $200m for each of two years. We are now told by the Government that it is not the first position, it is not the second position, but it is a position of no value to the wool industry whatsoever because it will be advanced at some stage if the industry needs to borrow in order to facilitate the sale of those assets.

Minister Kerin has gone on the public record on a number of occasions and said that it would be $200m or its equivalent in interest payments up front. How can anybody believe anything this Government says in relation to what it will do for the wool industry? Tonight the Wool Council of Australia put out a statement indicating its lack of confidence in that shifty exercise by this Government. We have deleted completely any reference to the so-called generosity of this Government from the last series of calculations that I have given to the Minister for incorporation in Hansard and from which he has made some quotations.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        We are also suddenly told that there is a redundancy payment requirement of $14m. Okay, the Wool Corporation has general reserves of $30m which at this stage nobody has talked about or touched. Surely the appropriate use of the reserve of the Wool Corporation is in relation to a redundancy payment situation and $30m is there with money to spare for what everybody understands will be a reduction in the size of the Corporation because there is no longer a reserve price scheme.
       </para>
       <para>
        We are also told that there is an increased cost of administration: up from $45m-which the Corporation had been quoting to the Council, ourselves, Acil Australia Pty Ltd and everybody else as its total running costs and those of the Realisation Commission-to $52m. It can use some of that reserve as well because these are difficult times for the wool industry. But the most absurd part of the Government's position is that somehow or other if we sell wool from the stockpile we will reduce the price. That is the key to the Government's argument.
       </para>
       <para>
        The figures that the Wool Corporation put together for the Government, which were tabled by Minister Kerin, indicate that it believes that we can sell 40 to 45 million kilograms of wool in the first year, presumably without reducing the price. That is far more than the 25 million kilograms that we are saying. Let us look at the reality of this. All of our calculations are based on 450c per kilogram clean. The present price of wool is 600c per kilogram clean and sales are going on at the present time out of the stockpile. It is the general understanding in the industry-Vines himself and others in the industry have supported it-that over many years 900 million kilograms per year had been sold on a sustainable basis from Australia. The latest projection of the forecasting committee is down to 881 million kilograms. Because those figures were out of date when they were announced, everyone believes that it will fall further.
       </para>
       <para>
        Surely any sales from the stockpile which, in total, are less than that 900 million to 914 million kilogram figure would indicate, even on the old price for wool, that we can sell without reducing the price to growers. If we do take into account the fact that there is a lower price-and everybody in the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics and everyone else tells us that because of the elasticity of demand we should be able to sell more-that makes a complete mockery of the central feature of the Government's argument that somehow or other there is a downward spiral the moment we sell one bale of wool out of the stockpile. At the present time, the price is increasing to 600c per kilogram and wool is being sold from the stockpile.
       </para>
       <para>
        What a mockery of an argument. What an absurd argument for anybody to put forward in order to justify an ideological position which is there to drive woolgrowers out of business. I bet that in those calculations the Government has not taken into account the savings to woolgrowers from the lower levy. That is a simple fundamental thing that it would not even think of.
       </para>
       <para>
        What about the treatment of AWC assets? There is a major difference between the Opposition and the Government on this. We were advised by the Wool Corporation that it was possible to sell $120m. There are about $300m worth of assets in total-everybody recognises that. Those assets are woolgrowers' money which has been put there by levies on behalf of, and from, woolgrowers. In these difficult times for the wool industry, particularly in that first year, surely the most sensible use of that woolgrowers' money-not government money but woolgrowers' money-would be to use it to reduce the debt servicing charge. That is what makes up the big difference between the Government's figure and our figure because it is about $25m or $26m for every one per cent of the levy.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let us look at the next argument put up by the Government about meeting targets. The debt repayment schedule contained in Minister Kerin's document refers to both debt reduction of so much per year and debt outstanding required by the Government at the end of that financial, or wool selling, season. We all agree that the debt at the present time is $2.57 billion. There is no argument about that because we have all given away the $200m because it was pure fairies.

        <para in-line="1">
         â€”I thank you, Mr Deputy Chairman, and I thank the chamber. We have two figures: annual debt reduction and debt outstanding. The Minister has made the point that the Government wants to insist on those actual figures of debt reduction each year, even though there is no difficulty, on a 10 per cent or even an 8 per cent calculation, in meeting the debt outstanding figure at the end of each financial year. For example, we are on $2.57 billion at the end of this financial year. The official figure required by the Government in June 1993-two years from now-is $2.559 billion. In other words, it is basically the same as what the debt is down to now. So there is no difficulty according to our figure, or even the lower figures that I have seen calculated by other reputable people in the industry, in meeting that outstanding debt target each year and it must stand.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        To the great discredit of this Government, when the debt outstanding schedule is met at the end of the financial year it will still require its pound of flesh, in spite of how many woolgrowers it sends bankrupt in the meantime, by requiring a certain debt reduction each year. But we include the debt reduction in our figures. What does the Government really want with its debt repayment schedule? We have challenged the Government time and time again to produce its figures. We have shown ours and we want the Government to show its figures, too. They could be interesting.
       </para>
       <para>
        The schedule of repayment is seven years. The document from the Australian Wool Corporation tabled by Minister Kerin indicated five years. When the Minister made his speech he referred to certain aspects of a conversation he and I had before dinner, and I appreciate that courtesy. He mentioned certain figures in relation to that conversation which suited his argument, and I intend to mention some that suit my argument. On the Government's own figures it is now a six-year repayment schedule, with 14 per cent interest in the first year, 10 per cent interest in the second year, 10 per cent interest in the third year, 9 1/2 per cent interest in the fourth year, 9 1/2 per cent interest in the fifth year, and 9 1/2 per cent interest in the sixth year. What does that do for the Government's credibility-requiring that high interest payment? What is its real debt repayment schedule?
       </para>
       <para>
        I am pleased that the Government has changed its tack a little with the Acil report because in countering that report its argument is that it calculated in the non-existent $200m-that so-called loan that no longer exists. Before that, it was quoting 3.11 of the Acil report, but it quoted only the first paragraph. To make sure this gets in the record, I am going to quote two paragraphs:
       </para>
       <para>
        In summary, without additional variation to the assumptions likely to have been used by the Government means that no change to the wool tax would be required for 1991-92. Some changes in the industry since March work to reduce the rate of tax while others work in the opposite direction. Overall, the changes amount to a difference of less than 0.5 per cent.
       </para>
       <para>
        That was great stuff for the Government when justifying the 15 per cent to everyone who rang, but it failed to quote the next paragraph, which states:
       </para>
       <para>
        To reduce the rate of tax below 15 per cent in 1991-92 would require some combination of deferring the payment of $20 million debt, capitalising some of the debt, extending the repayment period, selling wool from the stockpile, greater sales of AWC assets and/or some form of flock reduction scheme. These options are assessed in the following section.
       </para>
       <para>
        When we look at that we see quite different figures altogether. So I hope we do not hear any more about the Acil report. The Minister has quoted from a sheet that has reworked our figures, which no longer include the $200m. I seek leave to incorporate those figures in Hansard.

        That is the end of the general assumptions from the first page, to be read in conjunction with those three columns of the incorporation. It is our understanding that a higher price will be indicated before long.

        Those calculations indicate that we will be using asset sales of $120m to assist debt servicing and stockpile sales. But the fundamental point is this: whose assets are they anyway? They are the woolgrowers assets, and they are there to be used. If it comes to a choice between the sale of AWC assets that are not essential for the continuing function of the AWC and/or its replacements and the fire sales of woolgrowers' properties throughout Australia, which one should we choose?

         â€”We should help the growers because it is the same woolgrowers' money. The Minister talks about a depressed property market in Melbourne. God help us! What sort of market is it in the woolgrowing areas of Australia? It is terribly depressed. What form of favouritism do we have in this debate about the way the Corporation's assets, which are the woolgrowers' assets, are treated on the one hand and the growers' assets on the other? Remember, we are talking here about five percentage points, which is $125m to $130m of extra cash for growers, and we agree with the Minister that their incomes are very low-negative in fact. If we have these forced sales of woolgrowers' properties, what does it mean to the total asset-debt ratio then created for woolgrowing properties right throughout Australia and the compounding effect that has throughout the wool industry?

        If the Wool Corporation has some good commercial properties and leases, this is a good time to sell. If it is not a good time to sell, it is still a damned sight better than it is for the woolgrowers' properties. We will stay with 10 per cent. We are on the side of the woolgrowers. We have shown by our figures that it is realistic, sensible and equitable.

         â€”Before I was interrupted by the preceding debate, I was saying that in 1958-59 the company Ausfauna in South Australia exported between 7,000 and 8,000 kangaroos to the United States of America at #125 each-that is, 1958 pounds-a very high price. The cost of freight in that transaction was about #25 a head.

        Within weeks of the ban being imposed on the export of Australian fauna, and therefore kangaroos, we were shooting them by the thousands. This was when the human consumption market for kangaroos was opening up in Germany and a lot of kangaroos were shot in Australia and sold on the German market as Australian venison. It is to our eternal disgrace that the hygiene maintained at that time was so appalling that the Germans stopped the importation of Australian kangaroo meat for human consumption. Since then kangaroo meat has languished as a pet food. That just goes to show that the consequences of our actions are often not clearly understood.

        I want to move to the export of birds, in particular. I feel privileged to have been involved in the opening of the Nullarbor Plain, the last great pastoral development Australia will ever see. One of the significant things of the Nullarbor was that in a good season there used to be flights of budgerigars, in their hundreds of thousands, and the sky would turn from green to gold as they banked and twisted in the sun, all in unison. It was one of the most magnificent sights I have seen. Not quite so magnificent was the spectacle of 20,000 gallon concrete tanks chock-a-block full of drowned budgerigars, budgerigars which were dying in their thousands as water became short and not a single one could be exported. There has to be a nonsense in this arrangement.
       </para>
       <para>
        I looked at the figures for Western Australia some time ago. If we were to allow the export of non-rare species and tax them on the basis of 100 per cent-which would still allow a very good return to the seller-we would have something like $40m to $50m available for the management of national parks, many of which are today merely lines on the map. It is something that I think we are going to have to seriously consider.
       </para>
       <para>
        Once more, I want to say that we do have to consider the export of aviary bred birds. If we do this we have the potential for creating industries in some of our Aboriginal areas, industries in which Aboriginal women would very easily become involved. It certainly cannot be logically argued that allowing the export of aviary bred birds is in any way depleting the fauna. As I have said earlier in this speech, allowing the export of aviary bred birds would permit the Pearl Coast Zoo to survive, a zoo which performs a mighty job for the world in the preservation of rare species.
       </para>
       <para>
        In his speech, the Minister for Science and Technology (Mr Crean) said something about the fear of loss of species. This is a very emotive issue and I would like to quote something which I included in the Campbell Nebb report a couple of issues ago. Dr Vernon Heywood, chief scientist, plant conservation, for the International Union for Conservation and Nature (IUCN), said:
       </para>
       <para>
        A lack of adequate scientific information had been used by conservation biologists to exploit community fears about species lost.
       </para>
       <para>
        It turns out that, according to Mr Michael Kennedy, the coordinator of the Federal Government group assessing Australia's endangered species, and Mr Graham, former director of the Wilderness Society, environmental groups learned about Dr Heywood's paper before the IUCN Perth conference and applied pressure to have it suppressed.
       </para>
       <para>
        An acrimonious debate was promised and the result was that Dr Heywood and his co-author were dissuaded from formally presenting the paper. These are the kinds of tactics used by extremists to prevent their views from being challenged. It was a disgraceful episode, hardly likely to enhance Australia's image as a country which protects freedom of important discussion and which encourages the contest of ideas. I put that into Hansard because I think it is a sad situation that on a subject as important as this we are seeing vested interest groups distort and lie about the facts, often for the express purpose of causing unnecessary fear and concern in the community.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill also deals with penalties imposed on people importing animals and plant material into Australia without proper quarantining. This is a very dangerous phenomena, but I put it that it is far more likely to be done by what one might call the amateur than by professionals. The amateur is the one who sees something nice that grew in his home country and thinks that one will not hurt. There is no great motive for commercialisation. It is usually just a desire to satisfy a whim or to fill some perceived gap in their lives. I am not sure that this legislation is going to do a lot about that. It is my view that the only solution is consistent education of people, continually impressing on them the great danger posed to Australia by the introduction of these species without proper quarantine precautions.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the second reading speech the Minister also talks about the value of these animals. The case is cited of 10 gang-gang cockatoos, 23 Major Mitchells and four musk lorikeets, which had a value of $325,000. The reason they had that value is that they were rare. It is true that since we banned the legitimate export of Australian fauna, we have seen an enormous explosion in illegal smuggling from Australia, and this smuggling is often done with great cruelty. Because of these high prices, smugglers can accept a very low level of survival. They very often do, and they are very well rewarded for it. It really is pie in the sky to think that we are going to suppress it in this way. It needs enormous resources, resources which we simply cannot provide. As I said earlier, it was a much better situation when we had a managed industry where every licensed trapper was a policeman and a custodian of the proper management of the environment.
       </para>
       <para>
        We have problems with birds in many agricultural areas. They do become a pest. So we have the phenomenon where we simultaneously ban their export, yet we shoot them. We should ask why this has occurred. I think it is quite simple. In Australia originally there were vast numbers of trees. One of the characteristics of the cockatoo species is to ringbark around the holes in trees. I am not talking about dead trees; they make their nests in living trees. These holes are quite common in eucalypt species, certainly in older eucalypt species. The bird will ringbark around its nest basically to protect itself from goannas.
       </para>
       <para>
        When we cut down the trees and plant grain, what we do is reduce the habitat of the cockatoo but exponentially increase its food supply. So there is an enormous increase in the number of birds and an enormous reduction in their habitat. One finds many birds nesting in the same tree and the tree is extensively ringbarked, which very often leads to the death of the tree. That is something we have to consider, and we have to devise management strategies to overcome it. We are still faced with a situation where very often we ban the export of these fauna while at the same time trapping, poisoning or shooting them.
       </para>
       <para>
        Just to digress, snakes are not everyone's cup of tea. Back in the late fifties I could supplement my income by catching tiger snakes, which were very easy to catch in the south-east of South Australia. I used to get the princely sum of #5 each for them. Now, #5 for a tiger snake was not bad when wages were #6.10 a week. It is still legal today to kill snakes, and people do kill them almost without question; but to catch a snake and export it is a crime. The logic of that I find hard to digest, but I might add that I find it very hard to digest the logic of a lot that happens in this House.

        However, the tragedy is that the second reading speech of the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment, Tourism and Territories (Mrs Kelly) reveals something quite different. I would like to read a segment where the Minister refuses point blank to consider the export of live native fauna. She said in the speech on 22 August 1990:
       </para>
       <para>
        The changes will not alter the current ban on private and commercial export of live native fauna.
       </para>
       <para>
        Later on she said:
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government has affirmed that relaxing current controls is unlikely to be effective and is not in the best interest of the species concerned. The ANPWS has provided funding for research on methods of protecting crops from bird damage as this problem is central to the arguments of those advocating commercial export of live birds. It is considered that developing a better understanding of the birds' biology and behaviour and using this knowledge to vary agricultural methods will provide long term solutions while exporting birds will not. I am pleased to note that this approach has been wholeheartedly supported by responsible animal welfare agencies such as the RSPCA.
       </para>
       <para>
        Not only is a lot of that wrong but much of it is also nonsense. I do not necessarily blame the Minister; she would not know. She covers a very wide portfolio area and has only been there for a year or so. This sort of stuff has been written by the National Parks and Wildlife Service personnel and one would not expect much better from them.
       </para>
       <para>
        I believe that we should be able to export certain native birds, which I will talk about shortly. I say that from the position of being a veterinarian by profession before I got into this job and a farmer by trade, and I have studied this issue in some detail. I have rung these National Parks and Wildlife Service officials in Canberra to try to ascertain their thinking. Quite frankly, the more I talk to them the more hopeless it seems. They have no understanding whatsoever of this problem, and that is reflected in the second reading speech of the Minister.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is clear to anyone with any common sense and anyone who has been in the field that there are four species of native birds in this country whose export should be permitted. They are the greater sulphur-crested cockatoo, or cacatua galerita, the galah, or cacatua roseicapilla, the little corella, or cacatua sanguinea, and the long-billed corella, or cacatua tenuirostris. There are very good reasons why these four should be allowed to be exported, and I will go into some detail on that. Basically the reason is that there are hundreds of thousands of these birds now in certain areas where crops are grown along rivers and near large water storage areas and these birds are now being killed, both legally and illegally, by frustrated farmers. It is ridiculous not to allow exports of the birds under these circumstances.
       </para>
       <para>
        They have bred up into plague proportions. The galah is a classic case. Their habitat has expanded vastly across Australia in recent years, and in my electorate alone they are along the river systems, the Macquarie River and the Darling River, where crops are grown. They are so bad in some areas that farmers cannot grow summer crops at all-things such as sunflowers and sorghum crops. It is even very difficult to grow winter crops such as wheat in some areas. Farmers when they go out to sow no sooner put the seed in the ground than the birds are scratching it out and eating it. In some areas they virtually have to have someone riding shotgun on the tractors as they go around.

         â€”I rise tonight to respond to a report in today's Australian newspaper and possibly other newspapers of a speech made by the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Dawkins) on the subject of girls, science education and career choice. Mr Dawkins states:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Mathematics and one science subject should be compulsory for all Year 11 and 12 students . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        This would enable women to study different subjects and widen their career options. The article states that the Minister will ask State and Territory governments to make maths and science compulsory. I hope that the people involved consign this harebrained idea straight to the wastepaper basket.
       </para>
       <para>
        I speak as a former teacher of maths and I taught girls. The challenge of introducing girls who do not want to study maths to the wonders and the delights of solid geometry is really something. I loved teaching maths, but I have some knowledge of why girls resist being taught maths. Forcing them to study it longer than they want to is not the way to entice them into looking at careers in engineering or whatever else it was that the Minister had in mind. According to this newspaper report, Mr Dawkins stated:
       </para>
       <para>
        Subject and discipline choice are the key determinants of the range of occupations available to young women.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is certainly true. I ask: what are the key determinants to discipline choice? In my experience, the range of reasons why a number of girls certainly used to be very reluctant to study maths was very much linked to social attitudes. Those social attitudes need to be addressed in primary school, not year 11.
       </para>
       <para>
        If we say to a 16-year-old, `You must study any subject, whatever it is', that is just asking for disaster. I speak on this matter with some feeling. Without telling the House my story, I want to mention that I was a humanities person and my best subject was maths. It is a very common misconception that maths and science go hand in hand; they do not. If one wants to study science, then certainly one must have maths. If one wants to study humanities, it is as logical to link it with mathematics. Mathematics is a subject which flows through all levels of mental discipline and it is not inextricably linked to science. The reason I say that with some feeling is that my parents and my school made the mistake that because maths was my best subject, therefore, I ought to study science. I was one of those students who was forced to study science.
       </para>
       <para>
        I cannot tell the House with what enthusiasm I dismembered my chemistry textbooks page by page. The day finally arrived when I convinced them all that I was not cut out for science and I was allowed to drop the subject before total disaster befell my entire school career. That is not the way to address the matter.
       </para>
       <para>
        Whoever is coming up with this nonsense, I beseech the Minister to stop it now-whether the source is the Department of Employment, Education and Training, the Office of the Status of Women or whatever. Whatever social engineers are coming up with this nonsense that all secondary schools in Australia ought to study maths and science, they should stop now before total disaster is brought onto our education system.
       </para>
       <para>
        There are those who think that every student in Australia should study a language. I certainly would like all students in Australia to be exposed to the study of language so that at an appropriate level they can decide whether they want to go on with it or not. I suggest that the appropriate level of choice would be after year 10.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is precisely what happens with maths and science now. They are subjects that students are exposed to up to year 10 and from there on they choose according to their inclination. They can change their minds later in life; it is not an irreversible process. In any event, who told the Minister that the path to success in this society is in careers that are science linked? They are not. How many members of the Hawke Cabinet studied maths and science to matriculation level? How many members of all sorts of professions, eminent people in their own spheres, did it through studying maths and science? There are many paths to success in Australia. Let us stop this nonsense right now.

         â€”I want to refer tonight to a subject that interests me; that is, the Western Australian Royal Commission into Commercial Activities of Government and Other Matters and some of the evidence coming before it. The name of Arthur Tonkin probably will not mean much to members in the chamber, and neither should it. Arthur Tonkin was a monumentally ordinary man. He was Minister for Water Supply in the Burke Government. I can say without hesitation that I have never met a Minister more obsessed with his own self-importance and his own egocentric ideas. He was a man who believed that Perth did not exist beyond the Darling Scarp.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        It is true that whatever differences Arthur Tonkin had with him, Brian Burke stood by him in very difficult times when he was charged with having homosexual relationships with a young fellow. The charge was eventually dismissed, but it is a matter of fact that Brian Burke stood by him. I therefore felt appalled and quite sickened when Arthur Tonkin appeared before the Royal Commission making gratuitous remarks about the Government in which he was a Minister.
       </para>
       <para>
        Under questioning he did admit that it may have been that the tenderer for the casino did win it on merit. It was certainly manifest under cross-examination that he had no evidence whatsoever to the contrary. However, this did not stop the West Australian giving great prominence to the statements made by Arthur Tonkin. It is quite an appalling performance.
       </para>
       <para>
        This leads me to the problem that I see with this Royal Commission and, in fact, all royal commissions. I think there is a distinct chance that good people can have their characters irreparably damaged and slurs cast upon them quite without reason which lasts all their lives. I certainly urge that royal commissions in Australia adopt the principles on royal commissions set down by the House of Commons in 1966.

         â€”Today I wish to bring to the notice of the Minister for Administrative Services (Senator Bolkus) a matter concerning distribution of preferences. This matter exercises the minds of many candidates from time to time. I particularly want to talk about a practice now being followed in Western Australian elections, of which I approve; that is, for the returning officers to do a calculation of notional distribution of preferences on the election night. It is not a new idea, it was instituted in the recent Geraldton by-election by Mr Les Smith, the Electoral Commissioner in Western Australia. Of course, Geraldton is in my electorate. I understand that it was also used in the Federal by-election for the seat of Menzies in Victoria. In that case the outcome was very clear from the primary vote; in Geraldton it was not. Those of us who were extremely interested in the outcome found it very helpful that the Electoral Commissioner decided to undertake this particular practice.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I do not know that the press was particularly concerned. I think the press wanted to see a cliff hanger for another couple of days. The point I want to make is that the outcome of the notional distribution was supported almost within a handful of votes by the final count, so the technology used these days by the Electoral Commission works, and it is obviously very good.
       </para>
       <para>
        I would welcome the Minister taking some steps to implement this method in a formal fashion in the Commonwealth Electoral Act. Hopefully, it will be given more formality in State legislation. It is a great help, and it is now proven technology through its use in recent times. I would like to record my congratulations to the Western Australian Electoral Commissioner, Mr Les Smith, for the introduction of this innovative system. It does give an early indication, and on many occasions that is helpful to all concerned.
       </para>
       <para>
        I also welcome the efforts of Senator Beahan in the other place in putting a question along these lines to the Minister, and I welcome the Minister's fairly positive response in which, amongst other things, he suggested that the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters should be investigating this matter. I would urge that that reference be sought, because a lot more would be known as a result. Had the system been used in the recent New South Wales election, the outcome in certain seats may not have been held up. The delay denied New South Wales a government for a time. The system may have enabled the winner-as it turned out in this case, Mr Greiner-to approach the Governor at an earlier stage, and that would have been helpful too. New South Wales seemed to continue in the absence of us politicians, but there could have been circumstances in which it could not have done so.
       </para>
       <para>
        We have a situation where the notional distribution of preferences has been proved to be quite successful and accurate. I speak here tonight both to congratulate the Electoral Commissioner who took this innovative action and to request the powers that be to give this some formality.
       </para>
       <para>
        The honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) is still here. In his speech I thought he overlooked a simple fact-that there is a body of evidence which says that certain applications for a casino in Western Australia were simply not opened. I think he overlooked that fact in bringing those matters to the attention of this House. Probably the facility offered by the winner was the best one, but there is a lesson here for all politicians, and I point it out to the honourable member for Kalgoorlie: if one calls applications for a casino, one should make sure that one at least looks at all the plans.

I said in the Parliament on that night that this was really just the forerunner of a much broader plan that the Kennett Opposition had in mind, and that was to do an airline pilots job on State public transport workers. When I made those comments, Victorian Liberal Party members from all over the House came running into the chamber and said to me, `Where is your evidence?'.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The point I was making was that the game plan was to engineer-as soon as possible after an election were the Liberals to win office-a major public transport dispute in Victoria, sack the transport workers, pay out only their contributions and a bit of interest and, in doing so, save all the government contributions to the superannuation fund. That was the real game Mr Kennett was on about. The people on the other side got really uptight and accused me.
       </para>
       <para>
        But what do we see in today's Melbourne Herald-Sun? There is an article headed `Tough Medicine'-tough medicine for the transport workers. Let me quote from the article. The former Leader of the Opposition, Mr Brown, who I believe is being recycled for another run, given that Mr Kennett is trying to snatch defeat out of the jaws of victory for the Liberal Party, lays out in bald terms his plans for public transport in Victoria were he to become the Minister. The article says:
       </para>
       <para>
        He has promised massive reform if the coalition wins the next election and vowed no mercy for the militant and powerful unions if they stand in his way.
       </para>
       <para>
        He then goes on to say:
       </para>
       <para>
        If it means the system is shut down by industrial action then it will stay closed until the unions go back to work on our terms.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is what this whole superannuation lark in Victoria is really about. Mr Kennett was not going to be able to make the politicians' superannuation plan stick, of course. That was absurd. But he was laying the ground rules for the right to deprive the people who did not come up to his expectations of their rights to the government component of their superannuation fund.

         â€”Exactly. As the honourable member for Eden-Monaro said, like Joh did with the South East Queensland Electricity Board. The article goes on to say:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Mr Brown said thousands of the PTC's 21,000-strong workforce, many in management, would be shed over the next few years under a coalition government.

       <para>
        The remaining workforce would be made to work harder as long-standing inefficient work practices were eliminated.
       </para>
       <para>
        I think there is a pretty clear message there. For any public transport workers-in fact, for any public sector workers in Victoria-who want to know what Mr Kennett is really on about, he is on about engineering disputes. I repeat that he said:
       </para>
       <para>
        If it means the system is shut down by industrial action then it will stay closed until the unions go back to work on our terms.
       </para>
       <para>
        `Our terms' means `You do what you are told or you are sacked and you lose your superannuation entitlements'. That is the real game. No wonder, once a bit of pressure was put on, Mr Kennett hastily withdrew from his public commitment on superannuation. The game plan is starting to unfold only now. I will take every opportunity I can between now and the next State election to spell out to public sector workers in Victoria that this is what the superannuation game plan is.

         â€”I rise tonight to speak briefly about the World Summit for Children. There is an organisation in my electorate named `Results' which has been very active in promoting the cause of prevention of malnutrition, death, starvation and hunger in children all over the world. Last year in the lead up to the Summit-which unfortunately our Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) could not make, but many other Prime Ministers and heads of state did-I was very fortunate to be the patron of the World Summit for my electorate and to light a candle on top of Mount Dandenong for all those children in the world who are disadvantaged.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I would ask Senator Evans please to get together with the Prime Minister to see whether we can do something positive to meet the aims of that World Summit which the Prime Minister missed. It is appropriate that I read to the House briefly some of the goals which that Summit, which was held on 30 September 1990, decreed should be aimed for. The overall goals were:
       </para>
       <para>
        - A one-third reduction in under-five death rates (or a reduction to below 70 per 1,000 live births-whichever is less).
       </para>
       <para>
        - A halving of maternal mortality rates.
       </para>
       <para>
        - A halving of severe and moderate malnutrition among the world's under-fives.
       </para>
       <para>
        - Safe water and sanitation for all families.
       </para>
       <para>
        - Basic education for all children and completion of primary education by at least 80%.
       </para>
       <para>
        - A halving of the adult illiteracy rate and the achievement of equal educational opportunity for males and females.
       </para>
       <para>
        - Protection for the many millions of children in especially difficult circumstances and the acceptance and observance, in all countries, of the recently adopted Convention on the Rights of the Child. In particular, the 1990s should see rapidly growing acceptance of the idea of special protection for children in time of war.
       </para>
       <para>
        We have certainly seen the results of what can happen to children in time of war in the recent conflict in the Middle East. We have a situation around the world today where many millions of children die needlessly without the kind of protection that we could give them. It does not need billions and billions of dollars. I bring the House's attention to the Rotary Club's international program called Polio Plus, which raised some $40m or $50m worldwide and has the objective of eliminating polio in this century. That is certainly on the cards. It is a matter of delivery of the systems. It is not the money; the vaccine and the needles are very inexpensive. We simply need the delivery programs to get out there and do the work.
       </para>
       <para>
        Rotary sponsors many programs. It works to sink new wells in areas that do not have safe, clean water. It works to help train local people, to teach women in villages about hygiene and health prevention, rather than cure. These are simple things-they are not expensive-that are very important to help preserve and maintain the children of our world.

         â€”I rise to speak about the attempted takeover by Tate and Lyle of Bundaberg Sugar Co. Ltd. It is a matter that I have been following for some time with some interest. I am concerned for two reasons. I note the following in a newspaper article today:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Tate &amp;Lyle Plc intends to pay brokers a handling fee to process acceptances from shareholders in its takeover target, Bundaberg Sugar Co Ltd.
       </para>
       <para>
        A director of Tate &amp;Lyle Australia Pty Ltd, Mr Paul Cooper, said in Sydney yesterday: ``The payment of the handling fee in these circumstances is not unusual, and recognises the costs incurred by brokers in processing acceptances tendered by their clients.''
       </para>
       <para>
        The move comes as Tate announced to the stock exchange it had just 5.68 per cent of its target, despite a huge campaign and a war of words with Bundaberg management.
       </para>
       <para>
        ``We recognised the fee will give an incentive to the brokers,'' . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        ``We have spoken to many brokers and analysts in the past few days, and many have given verbal advice to their clients to sell.
       </para>
       <para>
        ``At least one major broker will be putting out a written recommendation.''
       </para>
       <para>
        Tate &amp;Lyle's offer of $4.10 a share has been extended to July 9 following receipt of federal government approval for the $325 million takeover to proceed.
       </para>
       <para>
        But shareholders have been put under pressure to deliver more than 50 per cent of the company by June 28 to enable Tate and Lyle to declare the offer unconditional without further extension.
       </para>
       <para>
        However, the chairman of the Bundaberg board, Mr Roy Deicke, has urged the company's shareholders ``not to feel pressured'' by this deadline.
       </para>
       <para>
        Tate &amp;Lyle has warned that the offer is final and will not be extended again.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am concerned about the takeover because Bundaberg Sugar is one of those companies that we regard as well managed-that is, it is asset rich. Unlike many corporations, it has managed to remain debt free. I am concerned on two grounds. Firstly, I cannot help but believe that Tate and Lyle see it as a prime asset stripping target, as was certainly the experience in Australia during the 1980s. One only has to refer to Bruce Judge and Ariadne Australia Ltd to see what happens to decent companies, such as Repco, when asset strippers go about their work. We have also seen that in many corporate takeovers in my own State of Western Australia and other States of Australia. It has not contributed to the proper conduct of business in Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        Secondly, Tate and Lyle also market an artificial sweetener. I cannot escape the feeling that there will be a conflict of interest between its two roles in marketing an artificial sweetener and then attempting to market Australia's sugar product.
       </para>
       <para>
        Thirdly, Tate and Lyle has been found to be involved in price rigging in the United Kingdom market. I do not believe that we need to bring to the Australian corporate scene people whose practices engage in price rigging. We have had enough problems with the Australian corporate scene in recent years-in fact, leading to royal commissions-that one does not need to have a takeover activity which may lead to this sort of exchange of ownership.
       </para>
       <para>
        I do not reflect upon the Foreign Investment Review Board decision in this respect, because in many senses the market place is working itself out. One is entitled, as a member of parliament, to have a view about this takeover. I do not believe in this circumstance that the takeover will necessarily benefit many Australian shareholders. I am interested that it has only yet got a 5.68 per cent acceptance rate. Clearly, many Australian shareholders prefer to hold on to their shares.
       </para>
       <para>
        One of the things that really bothers me-it is a matter that we are looking at in respect to the takeovers code-is that I hold the view that it is good that Australians should own shares. I think it is important that we have an increasing level of shareholder ownership in Australia. But if minority shareholders are subject to predatory takeovers all the time, which has been a recent experience, then people are discouraged from operating in the marketplace. In this case, it is up to the big institutions that are the major holders of Bundaberg Sugar scrip that they show some commitment to an Australian company and operate in the market place to retain those shares of Bundaberg Sugar.
       </para>
       <para>
        The end point has to be that it is in Australia's interests that we have a properly managed company and a company that currently is debt free that remains an Australian company, not because of some crazy xenophobic attitude, but simply because it is difficult for me to understand where the benefits will come to Australia from allowing the Tate and Lyle takeover to succeed. I believe it is better that the Bundaberg Sugar arrangement remains as it currently is.

         â€”In the short time we have left tonight, I wish to talk about the crises facing the rural industry. Over the last two weeks the rural sector has had a break. The woolgrowers, in particular, in this country have had a break, as well as the wheatgrowers. I am talking about the weather. Mr Speaker, you may well be aware of the amount of rain that has fallen in New South Wales and Victoria. I assume that Queenslanders have had some as well.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The woolgrowers of this country now need a realistic appraisal of the level of wool tax that they can afford. The reality is that 15 per cent is not a realistic level; the reality is that 10 per cent is and the reality is that even 10 per cent may be too high. The coalition has done its homework. It knows full well that 10 per cent is an achievable level. I am absolutely horrified that again this matter has gone back to the Senate without any resolution. We are talking about the future and the livelihood of the woolgrowers of this country. I rather suspect that we may be talking about the future of this country itself. We can never underestimate the contribution that the agricultural primary sector of this country makes and that export of all exports, Australian wool.
       </para>
       <para>
        I believe that the new Minister for Primary Industries and Energy (Mr Crean) now has an opportunity to establish himself in the bush. I am afraid that he has let that one opportunity that he was going to be given slip very sadly past him. He needs to have a second look tonight at his position.
       </para>
       <para>
        I urge the Australian Democrats to support us. On not too many occasions can they be trusted to do anything for the rural sector. They at least did support the 10 per cent tax in the Senate the other night. We will see whether they have the backbone to continue with the support for the 10 per cent tax over the next 24 hours. If they do not, they will be judged for what many believe they already are. They sail with the wind. Let us see where their spines are. More importantly, let us put the new Minister for Primary Industries to the test, see whether he is prepared to accept the 10 per cent and see whether he is prepared to accept that the woolgrowers of this country quite simply cannot afford more than 10 per cent and they most definitely cannot afford the 15 per cent that has been mooted by the Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        This is an extremely important issue and I urge all Government members, especially those who represent rural interests and rural sectors, to sit back and have a long hard look at this. If it goes back to the Senate tonight or tomorrow they should instruct their senators to support the coalition's position on a 10 per cent wool tax and not this ludicrous and potentially heart-breaking and farm breaking tax of 15 per cent that has been proposed.

       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) No. A 008 information service provided by the Department of Community Services and Health to answer queries on revised Pharmaceutical Benefits arrangements has received more than 17,000 calls, 48% from pensioners and 15% from community pharmacists. No reports from either pensioners or pharmacists support this claim.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) The $2.50 charge for Pharmaceutical Benefit Scheme (PBS) prescription items for fringe benefit pensioners was introduced from 1 November 1990.
      </para>
      <para>
       The compensatory increase in pension for these pensioners commenced from the first pension day in November. For Department of Veterans' Affairs pensioners this was 1 November 1990. For Social Security pensioners the increase applied from pension payday 8 November 1990.
      </para>
      <para>
       Although the increase for Social Security pensioners commenced 8 days after the introduction of the charge, a number of steps were taken so that no pensioner would be out of pocket. These steps included:
      </para>
      <para>
       - All pensioners were given ample notification (approximately ten weeks) of the introduction of the charge. This allowed pensioners more than sufficient time to obtain essential prescription items they may need, free of charge, to use between the introduction of the charge and the payment of the supplement. There is clear evidence both anecdotal and factual of widespread stockpiling of medications in the period leading up to 1 November.
      </para>
      <para>
       - All maximum rate pensioners, both DVA and DSS pensioners, on the first pension payday in November were paid $50 ($25 each for couples) advance of the Pharmaceutical Allowance. This was to ensure those pensioners who needed a number of prescription items at once would have the funds available. Further advances are available for these pensioners if they are higher users of prescription items and in financial hardship.
      </para>
      <para>
       - Once a pensioner, or pensioner couple, spends $150 on PBS prescription items between 1 November 1990 and 31 December 1991 any further items are provided free of charge. This safety net level is equal to the total amount of Pharmaceutical Allowance during this period.

The grant is for the construction of a 20 place hostel, which includes two respite places. The grant was calculated on the basis of the facility accommodating 90% financially disadvantaged persons. This entitled the organisation to maximum capital funding. (a) the Grant of $1,607,320 is comprised of a figure of $1,464,320 for the building and $143,000 for the land.

        â€”The answer to the honourable member's question, based on advice from Telecom, is as follows.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) In deciding whether to provide a public payphone Telecom Australia Payphone Services takes into consideration a number of community and commercial matters. Such judgements attempt to embody the relative importance of each of the factors applicable to the particular situation. Thus the factors do not have dedicated weights and, as a result, Telecom Payphone Services has a range of installations across Australia that reflect practical, commercial and humane considerations.
      </para>
      <para>
       A list of the factors which are evaluated consistently include the following:-
      </para>
      <para>
       - availability of line plant and continuous commercial power facilities that must meet the requirements of the local power authority and Telecom specifications,
      </para>
      <para>
       - physical remoteness which impacts on accessibility for maintenance, coin clearance and cleaning,
      </para>
      <para>
       - the revenue earning potential-to offset the capital investment on ongoing maintenance costs,
      </para>
      <para>
       - the penetration of residential telephone services in the community,
      </para>
      <para>
       - community needs, for example, safety, backup for domestic services, a service for tourists, visitors and the local community when away from home,
      </para>
      <para>
       - the proximity of other public payphones, including privately leased services,
      </para>
      <para>
       - the relative priority of an individual application for service against other outstanding work, and
      </para>

        â€”The Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support has supplied the following answer to the honourable member's question:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       A three month trial of enhanced version of simultaneous runway operations (SIMOPS), which uses aircraft performance category, temperature and weather conditions to determine the length of runway required for aircraft operations, commenced at Sydney Airport on 2 August 1990. The trial proved successful and the procedure is continuing to be used at the airport.
      </para>
      <para>
       (a) The average delay per aircraft during the three month trial from August to October was 3.53 minutes. Since October the average delay with the enhanced SIMOPS procedure in operation has been 2.66 minutes. In the four months preceding the trial the average delay was 5.20 minutes.
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) The Civil Aviation Authority monitors and analyses noise patterns around Sydney Airport. At present, it is possible for the CAA to provide only preliminary estimates of the noise impact of its enhanced SIMOPS procedures, which were introduced last August. For valid comparisons to be made, it is desirable to have data for a period of at least twelve months, to take account of short term variations.
      </para>
      <para>
       The preliminary estimates indicate that the number of persons seriously affected by aircraft noise in the vicinity of Sydney Airport in 1990 was around 44,800. The CAA has estimated that, had the enhanced SIMOPS not been introduced, the number of persons seriously affected would have been around 39,800.
      </para>
      <para>
       Both these figures are substantially below the figure for 1988. (The figures for 1989 were distorted by the effects of industrial disruptions.) The number of persons seriously affected by aircraft noise in 1988 was 56,200.

       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) The new initiatives build on and extend previous programs of support for the aerospace industry. In particular they provide a link between the offsets program of the past and a sustainable, internationally competitive aerocomponents industry.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Access to markets will be facilitated through fair trade agreements with major overseas aerospace companies and industry competitiveness will be supported by initiatives to improve research, industry structure and firm level capability.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) The major cost of the program will be support for the Aerostructures Co-operative Research Centre at $12.5m over seven years. Other initiatives will be delivered through NIES, State Governments and industry associations at an entire cost to the Commonwealth of $1.5m per annum.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) The program, which runs for ten years, will absorb most of the costs in the first 3 to 5 years. Overall global costs are estimated as $5 million.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) The program commenced immediately following the Statement of March 12. The first fair trade agreement was signed with Boeing on April 16.
      </para>
      <para>
       (6) The Department of Industry Technology and Commerce reviewed existing and future programs through discussions with Australian firms, overseas companies and a study of the assistance programs of other countries. This review is not available as a formal report.
      </para>
      <para>
       (7) The program objectives are to establish an internationally competitive capability in the design and supply of aerocomponents to the world's major aerospace firms. The problems it is seeking to redress are restrictive international marketing practices and the levels of capability of Australian firms to participate in risk sharing ventures in the international aerocomponents market.
      </para>
      <para>
       (8) No. The program was not a response to the failure of industry. It is intended to assist an already competitive industry to better position itself for future growth.
      </para>
      <para>
       (9) In terms of the aerocomponents industry this question is restricted to suppliers of large civil aircraft and engines. This industry is dominated by a few suppliers (Boeing, Airbus, McDonnell Douglas, Pratt and Whitney, GE, Rolls-Royce, SNECMA) and there are substantial barriers to entry including capital, technology and restricted markets. The present strengths and weaknesses of these firms are reflected in their market shares. Boeing and GE have a dominant position. Smaller suppliers are generally forced to compete with each other to become either risk sharing partners or sub-contractors for the larger firms.
      </para>
      <para>
       (10) This program is designed to allow Australian firms to participate from the outset as smaller joint venture partners in the development of new aircraft or aero-engines.
      </para>
      <para>
       (11) The major beneficiaries of the program will be Hawker de Havilland, AeroSpace Technologies of Australia and Turbine Components of Australia. Other smaller firms are expected to benefit as subcontract suppliers to these firms.
      </para>
      <para>
       (12) The civil offsets program has been the principal vehicle through which the Australian aerospace industry established itself as a competitive sub-contract supplier of aerocomponents. The fair trade agreements build on the previous program and are being offered in lieu of existing and future offsets obligations.
      </para>
      <para>
       (13) As at 30 June 1990, 51 firms were in a combined offsets surplus of some $442.6 million. On the same date, 53 firms were in offsets deficit to an aggregate amount of $446 million. This indicates an aggregate net deficit of $3.4 million. This is a reasonable figure given the natural lag between obligation and achievement. Many projects on the achievement side take time to build up and will continue for several years after the obligation has been established. Only a small number of these firms will be involved in the aerocomponents industry initiative.
      </para>
      <para>
       (14) This information is commercial-in-confidence between the buyer and supplier and is not available. However, during the 1983-90 period Australian airlines brought into service twenty-six Boeing supplied aircraft at an estimated cost of $1,000 million. This does not include some Boeing manufactured aircraft which were brought into Australia on short term lease.

       <para in-line="1">
        â€”The Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) The technologies covered by the Advanced Manufacturing Technology Development Program (AMTDP) will be broadly and flexibly defined. As indicated in the March 12 Industry Statement, the AMTDP will support a wide range of advanced manufacturing technology products and services, including, but not limited to:
      </para>
      <para>
       - advanced materials and related process technology;
      </para>
      <para>
       - advanced computer controlled or microprocessor based equipment used in the design, production testing or handling of a product; and
      </para>
      <para>
       - advanced manufacturing techniques or services.
      </para>
      <para>
       Given the pervasive nature of these technologies, it is expected that there would be a wide range of manufacturing applications.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) The AMTDP will operate within the Innovation Program and will be established under the Industry Research and Development (IR&amp;) Act. The new program will be modelled on the National Procurement Development Program (NPDP) and the NPDP Committee, a committee of the IR&amp; Board, will be responsible for selecting applications for AMTDP funding. Members of the Committee are drawn principally from the business sector.
      </para>
      <para>
       Applications for AMTDP support will be assessed against established eligibility and merit criteria. It is intended to develop these criteria in consultation with the appropriate industry associations (for example, the Council of Australian Machine Tool and Robotics Manufacturers) and other relevant groups in the research community and industry generally.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) The AMTDP will be administered along the lines of the NPDP and be grants based. It will provide grants of up to 50% of agreed project costs. There will be no grant ceiling but applicants may be required, at the discretion of the Selection Committee, to finance over half of all project costs. The duration of grant funding will be limited to a maximum of three years.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) As I pointed out in the Government's March Industry Statement, the use of advanced manufacturing technologies and techniques can make important contributions to efficiency and productivity, skills enhancement, employee well-being and general competitiveness. Their use will be vital to the successful restructuring and revitalisation of the manufacturing sector.
      </para>
      <para>
       At the same time, we also need to encourage and foster the local development of key competencies able to assist firms to meet their requirements for new technologies and techniques and to apply them effectively.
      </para>
      <para>
       A recent study by Andersen Consulting, commissioned by my Department, had as one of its objectives the identification of major constraints impeding development of the AMT sector. That study highlighted a requirement for effective diffusion of enabling technologies as a basis for developing structural competitiveness, the need to apply and adapt advanced manufacturing technologies to suit local conditions, and the importance of linkages between suppliers and users in these processes.
      </para>
      <para>
       This study also concluded that there were local producers of AMT products with world class potential, but that they currently lacked credibility in the local market and overseas. It perceived a need for research and development in the AMT area to have a stronger market driven focus, with greater collaboration between producers and end-users and the formation of strategic alliances.
      </para>
      <para>
       The study referred to has been widely distributed and a copy may be obtained on request from my Department.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Pappas Carter Evans Koop/Telesis study for the Australian Manufacturing Council (``The Global Challenge: Australian Manufacturing in the 1990's'') identified, as specific areas of AMT which Australian companies have been slow to adopt, computer aided design, numerically controlled and computer numerically controlled machine tools, robotics, and flexible manufacturing systems. These findings are consistent with the 1988 Survey of Manufacturing Technology by the Australian Bureau of Statistics.
      </para>
      <para>
       These are the sorts of key, enabling technologies which Australian industry must adopt to become more competitive, but we also need to build up our supply capability. The need to do more to encourage the development and diffusion of AMT has also been recognised by peak bodies on both the employer and union sides.
      </para>
      <para>
       The revised bounty for production of machine tools and robots and the AMT Development Program are designed to address the supply side issues. On the demand side, a number of Government programs are aimed at encouraging and facilitating the use of new manufacturing technologies and techniques. The effectiveness of these is currently being examined in a review for the Australian Industry and Technology Council, which has called for development of proposals for their improvement.
      </para>
      <para>
       In the meantime, the 1990 Manufacturing Survey by KPMG Peat Marwick indicated that firms were focussing more on new manufacturing techniques, such as Total Quality Management (TQM), Just-In-Time (JIT) and Value Added Management (VAM)-this is encouraging.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) The objective of the AMT Development Program is to encourage and support more local development, production and use of AMT products and services. By assisting with development, trialing and demonstration of new products, it seeks to alleviate problems faced by local producers during pre-production and market development phases. These relate not only to the heavy financial burden of these phases but also to the problem of gaining customer acceptance and credibility in the market, which joint research and development can help provide. This can also create strong linkages and synergy between the partners which can contribute much to improvements in supplier performance and quality, technology diffusion, and the general competitive advantage of the Australian manufacturing sector.
      </para>
      <para>
       (6), (7) Covered by the response to (4).
      </para>
      <para>
       (8) The AMT industry contains a core of highly competent and competitive companies which have successfully penetrated niche markets internationally, in some cases exporting as much as 70% of their production. This can be primarily attributed to their technological advantage, achieved in part through their high level of R&amp;. Companies in this industry typically spend more on R&amp; (for example, 15% of turnover in the case of machine tools and robots producers), in sharp contrast to manufacturing generally, where expenditure is less than 2% of turnover.
      </para>
      <para>
       (9) No.
      </para>
      <para>
       (10) Local companies compete with imports of a wide range of products in four broad categories:
      </para>
      <para>
       - automated materials handling;
      </para>
      <para>
       - production equipment, such as machine tools and robots;
      </para>
      <para>
       - inspection and quality control equipment and systems; and
      </para>
      <para>
       - integration, communication and control equipment.
      </para>
      <para>
       (11) Mainly from abroad-around 80% of requirements.
      </para>
      <para>
       (12) Imports, principally from Japan, Europe and the US.
      </para>
      <para>
       (13) In the study mentioned in the response to (4), the size of the Australian market for AMT goods was estimated to be of the order of $700 million in 1988/89. Data are not available for other years.
      </para>
      <para>
       (14) The AMT Development Program will operate for four, not three, years. $20 million in grant funds has been committed to the program-$5 million over each year-to be discharged over a seven year period as follows:

        â€”The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       The meaning of the word ``project'' as used in this series of questions appears to be interchangeable between the entire sheep blowfly genetic control project (1966-present), and the Furneaux (Flinders) Is trial and concurrent R&amp; and assessment activities (three financial years, 1988-91). The reply attempts to cover both interpretations, where this is feasible.
      </para>
      <para>
       (1) The Flinders Is (Bass Strait) trial is nearing completion, which is scheduled for June 1991.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) The sheep blowfly genetics and strain development research project has not been terminated. The CSIRO Division of Entomology is committed to maintaining essential blowfly strains and basic research for the 1991-92 financial year, using Appropriation funds.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Flinders Is trial will end in June 1991:
      </para>
      <para>
       a. because the agreed term of funding for the trial will have expired;
      </para>
      <para>
       b. the trial has run for 4 years (July 1987-June 1991)
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) The Australian Wool Corporation (AWC), the CSIRO Division of Entomology and Dept. of Primary Industries Tasmania (DPIT) provided funding for the Flinders Is project.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) Support for the Flinders Is trial was not prematurely terminated.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) (a) Yes. The AWC was approached for an extension of the Flinders Is project and to assist with essential strain maintenance during 1991-92, pending completion of the economic cost-benefit analysis; (b) this proposal was unsuccessful.
      </para>
      <para>
       (6) Prior to the Flinders Is project, the program was mainly funded by:
      </para>
      <para>
       - CSIRO Appropriation funds (genetic studies since 1966 and ecological studies since 1971); and
      </para>
      <para>
       - the Australian Meat Research Committee (AMRC) and its successor the Australian Meat and Livestock Research and Development Committee (AMLRDC) (genetic and ecological studies 1971-1988).

      <para>
       The long-term genetic control project (ie since 1971) has successfully fulfilled the primary goals of (a) quantification of the dynamics of blowfly populations, and (b) developing and testing of genetic methods for suppression of sheep blowfly populations.
      </para>
      <para>
       (8) The prospects for development of the project into a successful large-scale blowfly control program are good, providing funds are available after June 1992 for:
      </para>
      <para>
       - essential strain development and maintenance
      </para>
      <para>
       - involvement of production/process engineers in development of mass-rearing and release technology to further reduce the capital and operating costs of a large control operation.
      </para>
      <para>
       (9) If no further external support is forthcoming, the body of research findings accumulated during the life of the project would be preserved in the form of scholarly and technical publications, and reports to the AWC.
      </para>
      <para>
       However, genetic strains of sheep blowfly are expensive to maintain and, unless external support can be found, maintenance of this important resource cannot be guaranteed beyond 1991-92.
      </para>
      <para>
       - It would take an estimated ten years of research to recover to a similar position with regard to strains useful for blowfly population suppression.
      </para>
      <para>
       - Several other major research programs depend on the genetic strains of sheep blowfly being maintained by the Division, including:

       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) (a &amp;b) The real impact of the rural downturn on CSIRO research has not yet been felt. However, it will affect work funded by wheat, wool and sugar funds in 1991/92.
      </para>
      <para>
       Individual projects will be affected and CSIRO will be seeking to negotiate with funding agencies to ensure that cuts are made selectively so that research of highest priority can still be carried out effectively.
      </para>
      <para>
       So, with respect to the CSIRO Institute of Plant Production and Processing, reductions signalled for 1991/92 include a 54% fall in operating funds to be provided by the Grains Corporation for 21 continuing projects in the Division of Plant Industry. Also, the Division has had only five new projects approved by the Corporation, which is 50% down on the rolling 2-year average, and there has been a 60% reduction in the operating funds allocated for these projects.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Division of Plant Industry's new wool-supported projects will suffer a 26% reduction in operating funds. The Division is faced with meeting the salaries of 6 people whose wheat or wool funding will be curtailed after June 1991.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Division of Soils will similarly incur reductions in funding for continuing projects. Also, it has achieved a low success rate for new projects which were submitted for funding.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Division of Plant Industry is renegotiating an R&amp; contract with one of its commercial partners for the development and marketing of computer-based decision support packages, which has been adversely affected by the rural downturn.
      </para>
      <para>
       There could be a continuing reduction in support for wheat research with the termination of current projects in 1992 and 1993. The downturn will also affect research on other cereals and oilseeds funded by the Grains Corporation.
      </para>
      <para>
       So far as CSIRO's Institute of Animal Production and Processing is concerned, the effect of the rural downturn is limited to wool research.
      </para>
      <para>
       Wool textile research funding will be maintained in real terms for 1991/92. However, substantially fewer new projects in wool production, wool harvesting and raw wool marketing have been funded for 1991/92 as a result of the Wool Research and Development Council's decision to cut its budgets for research in these areas by 10 per cent nominal. Although, strictly speaking, no continuing projects have been stopped, some of the new'' projects were intended to replace existing ones, which have therefore effectively been terminated.
      </para>
      <para>
       From CSIRO's knowledge of projected income for the Wool R and D Council, it appears that the 10 per cent nominal reduction per annum will continue for some years. If the situation does not improve, by the end of the next five years CSIRO's wool research (excluding textile research) may well have fallen to half its present level. This would mean not only a reduction in the amount of research conducted but also a substantial reduction in available research skills because of the inevitable reduction in staff numbers.
      </para>
      <para>
       Under the policies of the present Wool R and D Council, textile research is to be maintained for the time being, but it is unlikely that this area will remain protected,particularly in the face of the continuing 10 per cent cuts elsewhere. If these reductions do take place, it is inevitable that textile research will also be cut, and that staff and skills will be lost from this area too.
      </para>
      <para>
       In the Institute of Natural Resources and Environment, rabbit research by the Division of Wildlife and Ecology stands to be affected by the reduction in wool funds. The Division is trying to find alternative resources for this work. Also affected by the cut in wool funding will be research into large scale drought prediction by the Division of Atmospheric Research.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) On a wide front, some existing projects will be discontinued and operating funds will be reduced. Inevitably, CSIRO will need to reassess its research priorities in the light of the situation.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) Funding bodies have not foreshadowed what will happen if the rural downturn continues.

        â€”The following answer is provided to the honourable member's question:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) In its 12 March Industry Statement the Government announced that it would `strengthen and develop effective links between research and its application. To this end the Industry Research and Development Board will focus more on the commercialisation of Australian innovations.'
      </para>
      <para>
       In developing a greater commercialisation focus the Board is actively investigating what role it might play in the post-R&amp; phases of IR&amp; projects. One study undertaken looked at factors contributing to successful innovation and commercialisation of R&amp; projects undertaken about a decade ago.
      </para>
      <para>
       Consideration is also being given to the Board's role in increasing the level of development capital available to its client base. It discussed this issue with representatives of major fund managers at its May meeting. The Government recognises capital availability is a major barrier to successful commercialisation.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Board will also need to take into account the findings of the commercialisation analysis announced by the Government in the Industry Statement, in addition to the findings of the Public Accounts Committee inquiry into research and development.
      </para>
      <para>
       The market orientation of the Board has been further enhanced through a broadening of its program base. This includes an extension of the Discretionary Grants Scheme to include market research and a substantial widening of eligibility for support under the National Procurement Development Program.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Yes. The Board has undertaken two formal reviews and is currently undertaking a third formal review of selected Board programs. These reviews are additional to the Board's regular on-going monitoring of Program performance.

      </para>
      <para>
       (b) The review was of the Information Technology, Biotechnology and New Materials Technology components of the Scheme. It was based largely on a project-by-project evaluation and on experience with the Scheme to date.
      </para>
      <para>
       (c) The objectives of the review were to evaluate the effectiveness of support for R&amp; activities in each of the three generic areas as a legislative requirement prior to their consideration for redeclaration until mid-1991.
      </para>
      <para>
       (d) There were three key findings of the report. The first was that most projects supported by grants were making good technical progress and were assessed as having a reasonable chance of leading to commercial benefits. Secondly the differences in stage of industrial development of industry sectors served by the Scheme gave rise to some confusion as to the nature of the research to be supported. The third was that the successes of the scheme, both current and potential are such that the Minister should be asked to extend the period of declaration for the three technologies under review until mid-1991.

       (d) The key findings were that the Communications Technology component of the Scheme is at too early a stage to assess its commercial impact, given the long term nature of the type of research it supports. The Review found that the Committee's activities have significantly strengthened the R&amp; infrastructure supporting the Australian communications industry and have successfully encouraged both transnational and indigenous companies to undertake longer term strategic research in collaboration with research institutions.

       On-going monitoring of each grant since the program's inception in 1987 is undertaken. The effectiveness of each grant in meeting its objectives cannot be assessed since it normally takes four years after technical completion for projects to achieve their commercial objectives.
      </para>
      <para>
       However most of the completed projects are currently being commercialised, with 23 known to have achieved domestic and export sales of $48.2 million and $4.8 million respectively. It is not possible however to provide detailed performance figures for individual grant recipients for Commercial-in-Confidence reasons.

        â€”The Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support has supplied the following answer to the honourable member's question:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) has a contract with the Australian Artificial Intelligence Institute (AAII) to study and investigate the application of artificial intelligence to the problems of air traffic flow management. This study is not related to services such as the separation of aircraft, but concerns the management of arriving and departing aircraft streams to increase capacity and minimise delays. This function is, at present, handled by a manual system.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) AAII have developed computer programs to optimise sequences of arriving aircraft to the runways and have a test system running with synthetic data at their offices in Melbourne. They will shortly commence the development of a final prototype system which the CAA plans to install for tests and evaluation at Sydney Airport by the end of 1991. The prototype will be able to accommodate the new air traffic control procedures (SIMOPS) introduced at Sydney and also aircraft using the proposed third runway.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) The only overseas airports known to the CAA that have automated flow control systems are Frankfurt, Germany and Orly, France. These are simpler systems than that being developed in Australia in that there is normally only one arriving stream of aircraft to Frankfurt and Orly. Additionally, the Australian system will, unlike those at Frankfurt and Orly, provide advice to air traffic controllers on optimum aircraft speeds.
      </para>
      <para>
       The latest information available to the CAA indicates that in 1988 Frankfurt Airport had 281,500 movements, Orly Airport had 193,000 and Sydney Airport had 219,075.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) Cost to the CAA over the three years to 1991/92 to achieve the prototype system in Sydney will be in the range of $0.98M to $1.13M. In addition, the project has attracted a grant of $0.25M from the National Procurement Development Program administered by the Industry Research and Development Board of the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce.
      </para>
      <para>
       If the trials on the prototype system in Sydney are successful, the CAA will have a working system. The CAA will then need to decide between the alternatives of maintaining the prototype for operational use or seeking commercial support for the manufacture of an operational system. In the longer term the system could be integrated into The Australian Advanced Air Traffic System (TAAATS) currently being planned by the CAA. The cost of the latter two options cannot be estimated at this stage.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) The flow control system being developed will help reduce delays and delay costs to the users of Sydney Airport. The benefits are likely to be worth several million dollars per year and justify the modest outlays in the project.

      <para>
       (1) The financial arrangements are the same as those that existed before the establishment of the CAA as a government business enterprise. Expenditure incurred on actual search and rescue (SAR) is recouped directly from Government. A notional amount is allocated in advance ($900,000-1990/91) and this is adjusted up or down depending on the level of expenditure actually incurred. Expenditure incurred on training and equipment is funded from the Safety Contract. The Treasurer, in his 1990 Budget speech, announced that the Government would continue to pay for the search and rescue activities of the CAA even though the rest of the Safety Contract payment would be phased out over three years.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) The CAA is presently conducting an internal examination of the adequacy of existing funding arrangements to determine whether they cover the costs incurred. There is no intention at this time to contract the CAA's SAR obligations to another body.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) No arrangements have been made to contract out the CAA's SAR obligations. Offers have been made by private bodies to enter into such an arrangement but the CAA does not intend, at this time, to employ the services of such organisations. This matter will be considered more closely during the course of an impending review of SAR services.

       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       By way of background, in July 1989 Telecom introduced a range of maintenance agreements offering various hours of contract coverage and guaranteed fault response times for small business systems. The Standard package offers service from 8am to 5pm Monday to Friday excluding public holidays.
      </para>

       The Quality Service packages, which offer wider hours of coverage and guaranteed response times, cost more than the Standard package to reflect the increased cost in providing and guaranteeing such maintenance service.

       The answers to the honourable member's specific questions are:
      </para>
      <para>
       (a) Yes. $350 is the fee applied by Telecom for customers who require service outside the hours as agreed between Telecom and the customer (Standard or Quality Service Maintenance Agreement).
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) No. There is no charge for a call-out within the hours specified in a customer's maintenance agreement. The labour charge for service outside the contracted hours of the maintenance agreement is $25 per 15 minutes.

      <para>
       (i) See answer to (b) above.
      </para>
      <para>
       (ii) The charges cover cost of recalling staff (the current minimum payment is 3 hours at double time) and effecting the necessary repairs. Telecom considers these charges are competitive with other maintenance providers.

      <para>
       (1) It is not valid to draw a relationship between course fees and student training days. Student training days applies to all training centres in Australia. The ``income'' shown as course fees in the Authority's accounts relates only to moneys collected from participants on residential courses at the Clyde Cameron College towards a ``fares equalisation scheme''. By this means participants from all over Australia effectively pay the same fare to attend these courses. The lower than usual figure for course fees in 1989-90 resulted from a drop in attendance at College courses due to the disruption to Australia's domestic air services during that period.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Apart from the fees collected from participants on College courses, as outlined above, TUTA does not charge fees for its services except as follows:

      <para>
       (1) The March 1989 Special Premiers' Conference on Housing endorsed the setting up of an expert taskforce drawn from Commonwealth, State and Local Government, the design professions and building industry, to examine the scope for significant reforms of technical regulation of building codes and standards. The Federal Government agreed to provide a program budget of $1.5 million over three years for the Building Regulation Review Taskforce to undertake the required examination. In 1990-91 BRRTF program expenditure amounted to $777,635. The remainder of the overall $1.5 million program budget is likely to be expended in 1991-92. The BRRTF has expedited the examination to enable its recommendations to be considered at the November 1991 Special Premiers' Conference on Microeconomic Reform.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) The Federal Government is the sole provider of the BRRTF $1.5 million program budget. However, the Taskforce has cooperated on a number of joint and related initiatives with the Australian Uniform Building Regulations Coordinating Council (AUBRCC). The State and Territory Governments collectively contribute $75,000 annually to the AUBRCC program budget apportioned according to the annual value of building work in each State or Territory.

      <para>
       The Government's policy, which I announced on 14 August 1988, is to integrate all Repatriation General Hospitals (RGHs) into the State health systems by 1 July 1995. This is being done to ensure the future of the RGHs as acute-care teaching hospitals. With the ageing of the veteran and war widow population, their medical needs are changing. They require access to local doctors, specialists and hospitals together with more emphasis on chronic care.
      </para>
      <para>
       Integration of the RGHs may occur earlier than 1 July 1995 where suitable arrangements are agreed with State Government and other interested parties. As far as RGH Hollywood is concerned, the State Government has not yet begun negotiations. A Western Australian committee of ex-service officials chaired by the RSL and consisting of representatives from the Australian Federation of Totally and Permanently Incapacitated Ex-Servicemen and Women (TPIs), Perth Legacy, War Widows' Guild, Ex-Prisoners of War Association of Australia (Ex-POWs), Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF), Naval and Vietnam Veterans' Associations is considering its position on a range of matters of particular interest to the veteran community.
      </para>
      <para>
       Officers from the WA Branch of the Department of Veterans' Affairs have assisted the Committee by attending meetings for information sharing purposes and to help clarify issues as they are identified. State Health Department input has also been sought.
      </para>
      <para>
       In February 1991 the Western Australian Minister for Health announced a review of the State public health system. Department of Veterans' Affairs has met with officials from the Review team and briefed them on progress with the integration process.
      </para>
      <para>
       Failing integration the Commonwealth's only feasible alternatives will be either sale or progressive wind-down as veteran and war widow demand inevitably declines.

      <para>
       Sufficient resources have been allocated to enable 400 recruits to be trained within Western Australia during the next financial year. This figure, while below the number of recruits to be trained this year, is based upon recent Army Reserve recruit figures in Western Australia. The number of recruit courses to be conducted within Western Australia is also to be reduced from around seven to four. This reduction is aimed at reducing the waste of resources which has occurred in the past by courses being only partly full.
      </para>
      <para>
       The reduction in recruit courses is not related to any Army overspending on rations.
      </para>
      <para>
       The reduction in the number of recruit courses will mean that some enlistees will be required to wait longer before attending recruit training than in the past. With the courses spread across the year it is expected that, in the worst case, a wait of ten weeks may be involved.

      <para>
       (1) Under President Hrawi the Lebanese Government has made progress in implementing the Taif Agreement, which provides for political reforms aimed at equitable power sharing between Muslims and Christians and a process for extending the authority of the central government. The Lebanese Parliament has approved constitutional reforms reapportioning power between the President and the Cabinet and providing for equal Christian and Muslim representation in an enlarged Parliament. A confessionally-balanced Cabinet has been formed. The Lebanese Army has successfully deployed throughout about 25 per cent of Lebanon, including all of Beirut, and President Hrawi has recently commenced the disarming and disbanding of the militias. This process is not complete.
      </para>
      <para>
       President Hrawi has laid the basis for overcoming the bitterness left by years of civil war. The continued cooperation of the various elements of Lebanese society will be important in bringing to fruition the gains already made. However, the role of outside forces is still a serious complicating factor. Israel remains in occupation of its self-styled security zone in defiance of United Nations Security Council Resolution 425. Syrian forces also remain in Lebanon. Although their presence is agreed to by the Hrawi government, Lebanese sovereignty will not be fully realised until they depart.
      </para>
      <para>
       Syria and Lebanon concluded this month a Treaty of Fraternity, Cooperation and Coordination. Reports indicate that the Treaty consists of a six-point plan dealing with cooperation and coordination in education, trade, foreign policy, security arrangements and the economy. Some Lebanese Christian representatives and Israel have claimed that the treaty may be a vehicle for increasing Syrian influence in Lebanon. It is too early for us to make such a judgement at this stage. As we have made clear over several years, we oppose any activity in Lebanon by Syria or any other country which compromises Lebanese sovereignty.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) The US Ambassador and his staff returned to Beirut on 30 March after being evacuated in January for security reasons.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) The operations of the Australian Embassy in Beirut remain suspended because of the security situation there. The Government does not yet regard the security situation as having improved sufficiently to allow the Embassy's resumption of operations, but continues to monitor closely developments in this regard. Our Embassy in Damascus noted in a recent assessment that security continues to be below what it would regard as an acceptable level for Australian officials to live and work.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) Two officials from our Embassy in Damascus visited Beirut on 13-14 May. They reported after that visit that there has been an improvement in the security situation in Beirut in recent months, but that the improvement is from a very low base: the situation could change quickly given the fragility of the situation. The dimension of the continuing security problems in Lebanon is indicated by the very extensive and costly security operations which those few Western embassies open in Beirut maintain in order to protect their diplomats.

       (1) Yes. From November 1987 to 20 July 1990, Senator Alston occupied two offices-an official electorate office at Box Hill and also an office at the Commonwealth Parliament Offices, 400 Flinders Street, Melbourne.

       (c) On 10 July 1990, after being briefed by his Department, the Minister for Administrative Services directed that Senator Alston immediately vacate his office at the Commonwealth Parliament Offices and occupy only his electorate office at Box Hill. After several attempts to negotiate a removal date and after the telephone services provided to him at the Commonwealth Parliament Offices were disconnected on 20 July, Senator Alston moved his office effects from the Commonwealth Parliament Offices to his Box Hill office on 23 July 1990.
      </para>
      <para>
       (d) Costs such as rent, electricity, cleaning and outgoings incurred at the Commonwealth Parliament Offices, Flinders Street, Melbourne are not attributed to individual occupants. However, an estimate of the probable cost, at July 1990 prices, is $1,590 per month (a total of approximately $50,000 for the period of dual occupancy). Additional telephone charges, which cannot be separately costed, are not included.

      <para>
       A Member may locate his or her electorate office at a location of his or her choice within his/her electorate or may choose to be located with the Commonwealth Parliament Offices of his/her State capital city.

      </para>
      <para>
       In accordance with approved Accommodation Guidelines, an electorate office should be approximately 120 square metres in size. Actual size depends on several factors such as cost, location, availability of suitable premises in the area and useable office space.
