          —The Committee's first report on its inquiry into the prescription and supply of drugs was tabled in the House on 24 March this year. The second report of the inquiry was tabled on 8 October. I wish to direct my comments to the second report, titled
          <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
           Prescribed health: prescribing and medication management
          </emphasis>
          . In gathering evidence for this report, the Committee heard from witnesses in Adelaide, Alice Springs, Canberra, Melbourne, Newcastle and Sydney. A number of issues were addressed in the report. One of the more important, perhaps, was the undergraduate training of general practitioners. We found, in looking and in talking to hospital personnel and to practitioners in the community, that much of the prescribing habit of doctors was learnt in the actual hospital itself, in their years as an intern. The quality of their prescribing depended very much on what took place in those internship years.

          Hospitals vary in the way they treat their interns. Some are thrown in and left to survive, while others—as happens at Flinders Medical Centre, the medical school near where I live, near my electorate—give their interns extensive training. We have recommended that it be a requirement for all medical courses that interns be given special training in interactive skills and communication with their patients. There should be special intern support programs, as there are at Flinders University.

          I mentioned communication. This was taken in the report as a very special issue, because one of the big problems that we are finding in the community is a breakdown of communication between doctors and patients. This is not necessarily the fault of the doctor. The doctor gives what he believes are very clear instructions, but what happens is that the patient, for one reason or another, misunderstands those instructions. Frequently, it is because the patient is embarrassed to ask for clarification. We had one particularly horrific report of a patient being prescribed liniment for her arthritis. She understood it to be a medicine, ate it, and died. That is not a single report. There are others, perhaps less dramatic, out there in the community.

          When we speak of communication, it is not just that doctors have to pick up their speaking skills and have the ability to inform their patients. Rather a whole course in communication is needed so that they can start to recognise the signs when the consumers themselves are not picking up on these types of things. Consumers have to take responsibility for learning what they have to do and it is part of the doctor's training to know that consumers have in fact taken that responsibility.

          Consumers are a focus of the report. There is concern growing in the community that consumers are not given enough responsibility for their health and that doctors traditionally have not trusted consumers with all the information. A few doctors said to us that consumers do not want to know. I do not think this is the answer and in the report Committee members do not think it is the answer. We think it is important that consumers realise that they have responsibility for their own medication, to follow the prescription and to understand what is happening to them. There are many consumer groups out there who are acting with that in mind.

          Another issue the Committee addressed was polypharmacy, which is a growing problem in the community. Particularly in the older community, consumers will take medicine from one doctor and then, for whatever reason, will go to another doctor for medicine which may contraindicate the first, but the second doctor does not know the patient is taking the first medication and the patient gets a reaction.

          There also can be a build-up of drugs. Quite coincidentally, I got a fax from my office yesterday relating a rather horrific story of a gentleman who had died. His daughter went to his house to clean it out and gathered together two green garbage bags full of medication. She was absolutely horrified. She said there was also a drawer absolutely full of Medicare slips and prescription slips. We have not followed the story up and we do not know exactly how this one person could have had so many medications in his house, but certainly his daughter is very concerned and so are we. This is a point addressed in the report, and how to stop polypharmacy going on has to be looked at.

          One of the ways is a computerised system, whereby every time somebody goes into a chemist's shop and takes a particular drug it is registered on the computer. This in itself has problems for privacy and I do not know how that issue can be resolved. When I went recently to a chemist's shop which I had not visited for a year and then only once, I found he could press a button and tell me what I had got in a prescription exactly one year ago. Frankly, I felt my privacy had been violated. Yet that same system could have prevented somebody who was older taking a drug that was contraindicated by a drug she was already taking. These are some of the issues that we address in the report and some of the issues that society has to address with regard to what is happening in this area.

          The Committee has also recommended that education about drugs be started at a very early age when children are at school so that they understand what is happening when they do take drugs and when they abuse them. We also suggest—I think a little hopefully—that non-drug remedies be looked at, including a change in diet and exercise rather than sleeping pills and other types of medication. Perhaps that has been a little hopeful or optimistic on the Committee's part. However, certainly there is room for doctors to look at alternative therapies, but we have to acknowledge that the time doctors are given to see patients is limited.

          This report was prepared in a context of considerable activity by other government bodies on the subject. Jenny Macklin, in preparing the Government's national health strategy, released two papers on the future of general practice and pharmaceutical drug use, which tended to cover the field of this report. The Trade Practices Commission produced a draft on self-regulation of the advertising and promotion of therapeutic goods. It then finalised that report and dealt with issues such as rational prescribing practice and promotional activities that distort such practice. Most importantly, the Pharmaceutical Health and Rational Use of Medicines Working Party, which is called PHARM, published a draft policy relating to education and strategies to encourage the better use of medicines. The Committee took these three valuable works under close consideration in finalising its wider report on the functions and responsibility of prescribers and consumers in the drug distribution chain.

          For those who would imagine that all is rosy in the world of drug prescribing, expert testimony before the Committee indicated that some 1,400 Australians die each year from the misuse of prescription drugs and some 40,000 are hospitalised. The report estimates that the cost to the Australian taxpayers could be as high as $69m annually. I notice that Dr Shepherd wanted to challenge those statistics, which are drawn from learned studies published in the
          <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
           National Health Strategy Issues Paper No. 4.
          </emphasis>
          However, the Australian public has learned to treat Dr Shepherd's utterances with a great deal of caution. What he will not admit, and what some members of his own profession admit, is that considerable responsibility for these tragic statistics lies in bad prescribing practices by Australian doctors, whose initial training and continuing education leaves much to be desired.

          However, the evidence would seem to suggest that the largest problem lies in the field of communication between doctors and patients. In the matter of the education of doctors, the report makes a series of recommendations to take measures that I am sure the general public assumed were happening anyway. Principally, that consists of codifying a core curriculum in clinical pharmacology to be taught in all medical schools. Some schools of medicine provide little education in prescribing, and clinical pharmacology is a low priority subject in most universities.

          It is hard to imagine that highly educated members of our community, such as doctors, may be lacking in communication skills, but there was overwhelming evidence before the Committee that that was the case. As the Consumers Health Forum pointed out:
         </tab>
        </para>
        <para font-size="-=2">
         It is no good treating someone if the person does not understand what the treatment is about.

        <para>
         For those who still find this problem hard to believe, anecdotal evidence was put before the Committee detailing cases—and they were referred to by the honourable member for Hawker—such as where a pensioner who had been prescribed a liniment for arthritis, ate it and died. Suppositories were taken orally, and massive confusion reigned in patients' minds over the timing and quantities of prescribed medications, frequently leading to serious illness and death. That is why the Committee has recommended that the interactive skills of medical undergraduates be honed and that communication units be incorporated in their studies. The Committee also recommended that these students be given work experience with general practitioners. The evidence pointed to the likelihood that prescribing habits acquired during internship had a great deal of influence on the prescribing patterns of GPs.

          As with all disciplines, medicine is besieged by rapidly changing technology, with new drugs and treatments appearing daily. Continuing medical education is naturally vital if the GP is to cope. The quality and the content of that education are very important. These days, most continuing education emanates from drug companies, which lack the objectivity that is absolutely essential in matters involving life and death. That is why a range of recommendations, including support for independent academic detailers, is included in the report.

          Improvement in the drug database was another area that the Committee felt that the Government should give higher priority to. Of necessity, that involves the cooperation of the States, which is always difficult in our federal system, plagued as it is by childish State rights disputes. One of the most important aspects of this issue was the need for public hospitals to strengthen the adverse drug reporting processes as well as encouraging professional and consumer associations to find better ways to facilitate reporting.

          The Committee believes a computerised national drug information service is the way to go. The Committee, cognisant of the development of a national health strategy, also made a series of recommendations relating to the strategic application of Federal funds to improve Australians' health so far as prescribed drug usage was concerned. The work of the PHARM working party was seen as vital, particularly in developing a national centre for the quality use of medicines. The Committee thought that the centre would be best located in Academe and that it should be primarily government funded to give it the objectivity essential to the development of acceptable policies.

          The Committee also urged the Government to rationalise the current cumbersome general practice consultative process. Consumers, of course, were not forgotten in the report. Indeed, the report is characterised by its consumer orientation. The Committee accepted the fact that quality drug use could be achieved only by a team approach to health care in which the health professionals and their patients had a mutually informed interdependent relationship which, of necessity, should also involve interaction between the various health professionals involved.

          The Committee's first concern was with the consumers' right to be fully informed about the drugs that they were taking. That, of course, is not a one way process. Educated consumers can play a very important role in providing the professional with information which will ensure the highest quality of drug use. Consumer education programs are essential and government funding of such programs is vital.

          An issue that cropped up frequently in this context was polypharmacy; that is, adverse reactions from multiple medications. This is especially important in the case of elderly patients, who tend to suffer multiple medical problems. One obvious solution is to find alternatives to drug treatments for some of the patient's maladies. For example, problems such as insomnia, constipation and mild hypertension can often be simply treated not by drugs but by changes in diet and regular exercise.

          A related concern in this area is the inadequacy of medication record management. Patients frequently have a number of medical advisers who often have difficulty keeping track of their colleagues' prescriptions. Unfortunately, the real civil liberties issues raised by the computerisation of a patient's medical records have left this problem unresolved. However, the Committee remains optimistic that telecommunications networks and smart cards can be devised that will overcome the proper Big Brother fears of the community.

          Finally, I wish to say something about the role of nurses in ensuring quality drug usage. Nurses play a vital role in monitoring drug treatment and ensuring patient compliance. In particular, nurses in remote rural areas play a truly heroic part in delivering health care where neither doctors nor pharmacists are available to dispense drugs. That is why the Committee recommended extension of a nurse's licence to dispense drugs such as antibiotics.

          I was concerned to read the response of Malcolm Roberts on behalf of the hospital pharmacists opposing this particular recommendation. No group that came before the Committee impressed me as much as the hospital pharmacists, but they simply do not understand the problems of remote Australia. The highest professional standards are easy to impose in our public hospitals but, if one is a nurse treating a serious infection suffered by a tribal Aborigine in the Kimberleys without the benefit of a doctor or a pharmacist, then the distinction between prescribing and dispensing is meaningless. I was honoured to serve on that Committee and to work with the secretarial service that supports that Committee. I give my support to this report.

          There is a practical reason for our inquiring into these particular issues and it is as simple as this: 20 per cent of people who were admitted to our hospitals in Australia were there as a result of the inappropriate use of prescription drugs. The cost to the Australian community as a result of that is enormous and any work that we can do in this Parliament that can reduce the cost of the Australian health system, the cost of hospitals and the cost to individuals is very important.

          —It is a pleasure to rise to support this report which my colleagues the honourable member for Hawker (Mrs Gallus), the honourable member for Corinella (Mr Broadbent) and the honourable member for Robertson (Mr Walker) have already spoken on this morning. I would also like to convey my thanks to the Committee secretariat and to the honourable member for Scullin (Mr Jenkins), who chaired this Committee so ably and who will continue to chair it for the duration of our report activities. As has already been mentioned, we do have another report to bring down on this inquiry into the prescription and supply of drugs. We have already tabled one report. The one which was tabled recently by the Chairman is the second in the trilogy.

          The focus of this report is the professional practice which influences the prescribing of pharmaceuticals and the range and quality of information and education on appropriate drug use, as opposed to commercial promotion and marketing. This is an area that the Committee has given very serious consideration to, as it has a very widespread impact on the costs of health in Australia in monetary and personal terms.

          As mentioned by the honourable member for Hawker, the question of doctor communication skills was one which was raised in the Committee's deliberations. The report has attempted to address that question. The other matter that was of considerable concern was the question of consumer education on drugs and whether or not people understand properly the drugs that they are taking and the reasons that their doctors have prescribed the drugs.

          Polypharmacy was also mentioned by the honourable member for Hawker as being a continuing problem in the Australian community. People are attending more than one doctor and making it very difficult for any medical person to understand the full situation as regards their health. This is a matter which may be addressed, in part, by changes that the Government has introduced to general practice. There will be more encouragement in the near future for GPs, for instance, to have a steadier clientele and for people to try to reduce the number of doctors that they actually visit.

          Consumer education and GP education will also assist in this area. For instance, there is no point in patients going to more than one doctor if they know that a doctor has an understanding of their health needs, and that going to one doctor would actually ensure that they were not taking incorrect drugs or drugs that were not going to assist their condition because they might counteract drugs that they were taking for some other condition. In this regard I draw the House's attention to the situation confronting asthmatics in our society. This is very topical, given that the National Asthma Foundation had a meeting in Canberra this week at the old Parliament House—

Nevertheless, the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services (Mr Staples) was there to represent the Government and to make sure that the National Asthma Foundation was fully aware that the Government treats this matter as a very serious problem. This Committee has in its report made mention of this type of problem in the Australian community. The reason why I raise the question of asthma is that it costs Australian society an incredible amount of money but, until this point in time, nobody has identified what that cost might be.

          We all know that more Australians and New Zealanders suffer asthma than people in any other nation in the world. We do not always know why that is but we certainly know there is a cost involved. The National Asthma Foundation has now identified that cost for the first time in its report

         With such a widespread disease—and it is a life threatening disease; there should be no mistake about that—it is absolutely crucial that doctors understand the problem and properly prescribe drugs for people and that consumers of those drugs, the asthmatics themselves, are aware of what their drugs do and why they need to take a complete range of drugs. Hospitalisation of asthmatics frequently occurs because they are taking incorrect medication or incorrectly taking the medication that is prescribed for them.

As members of this House would know, the treatment of asthma can be preventive as well as spasmodic, and there are two or three different types of treatment which should be administered for all asthmatics at various times.

        Australians, as we know, have been watching very closely the drama being played out currently in Victoria. Over 150,000 people—men and women, young and old—marched in the streets of Melbourne on Tuesday to protest against the industrial vandalism of the Kennett Liberal Government. In May who would have believed that Mr Kennett would put on such a fine performance? Who would have believed that, in the same week as he arbitrarily robbed workers under Victorian awards of their holiday leave loading, his Minister responsible for industrial relations, Mr Gude, would give himself an $8,000 pay rise in a clandestine late sitting?

        I applaud this motion. The Faustian drama being played out in Victoria highlights the need for severe penalties to be introduced for breaches of Federal awards. The need for tougher penalties for award breaches is especially necessary in the Australian shearing industry. In that great industry, workers have had to rely on the enforcement of awards as protection against a deliberate campaign by groups such as the NFF and the UGA being prodded along by the extremists in the Liberal and National parties to lower their wages and break down their working conditions.

        These groups have been actively encouraging the employment of visitors to Australia in the shearing industry. This has made it increasingly difficult for Australian shearers to find work in that particular industry. At a time of high unemployment, this has led to conflict in many rural communities between Australian shearers and non-Australian shearers. Honourable members on the other side of the House, of course, love a bit of conflict—look at APPM and Robe River. And, of course, we know the honourable member for Bennelong loves it.

        I have nothing against New Zealanders or New Zealand shearers, but I do have a problem with the fact that the industrial relations system that applies in New Zealand is causing Australians to be put out of work, especially Australians in the shearing industry. The statistics back up the perception that it is New Zealand shearers who are posing a threat to Australians in that industry. In 1990 there were 288,900 New Zealand born persons living in Australia, representing 1.7 per cent of the Australian population. I understand that almost 50 per cent of these New Zealanders are shearers. The AWU estimates that 42 per cent of the Australian wool clip is now being shorn by New Zealanders.

        I believe there are a number of factors that, added together, have attracted New Zealand workers to Australia in droves. These factors include: the draconian industrial relations policies of the Bolger Government in New Zealand; the favourable taxation position of New Zealand workers in Australia; and the favourable foreign exchange rate for New Zealanders. These factors are working together to put Australian shearers out of work and to break down hard fought for Australian awards and conditions. In view of this, we should renegotiate the closer economic relations agreement between the two nations, and our current open door employment and social security arrangements with New Zealand.

        According to the 1986 census, there were about 211,600 New Zealanders living in Australia, making up 1.37 per cent of the population. The number of New Zealanders in the Australian work force as at May 1992 was 184,100, or 2.1 per cent of the work force. The total New Zealand full time labour force, according to the 1986 census, is about 1.2 million, including a component of 17,000-odd Australians. In other words, Australians make up about 1.4 per cent of the New Zealand labour force.

        It is obvious from these statistics that more New Zealanders prefer to work in Australia than vice versa. A report on temporary movements of people to Australia, released yesterday, shows that 400,000 New Zealanders came here on a temporary visa in 1991. I think this is understandable, in light of draconian industrial relations and social policies of the Bolger Government. Unions have been decimated and the minimum wage is barely higher than unemployment benefits available in Australia. The fact that only 17,000 Australians have chosen to work in New Zealand shows that New Zealand's deregulated market is not the huge drawcard that the coalition claims it to be. Clearly, New Zealand workers are better off working in Australia where they have the protection of negotiated awards and strong unions.

        The threat to the hard fought for award conditions in the shearing industry, posed by the influx of New Zealand shearers, is serious and should concern all workers. As I said earlier, I believe there has been a deliberate attempt by some peak rural bodies to undermine award conditions in the shearing industry. The bona fides of the Troubleshooters group should be investigated. This organisation appears to have embarked upon a deliberate attempt to undermine the AWU and all the hard fought for gains of the Australian union movement. Part of this campaign, I believe, involves the deliberate recruitment of New Zealand shearers. New Zealand shearers generally do not pay tax here and they have the benefit of a favourable foreign exchange rate. This means that some can afford to breach Australian awards by working for less pay or out of hours. Once the award is breached by foreign shearers it puts pressure on Australian shearers to do the same in order to maintain employment.

        As honourable members know, New Zealanders currently have open access to the Australian job market and social security benefits. Whilst I appreciate the spirit in which the CER agreement was entered into, I believe that the political situation in New Zealand has changed, to the extent that the Government should reconsider its open door policy. A form of work permits should be introduced so that when there is an Australian worker who can do the job, it should not go to a New Zealander.

        It has been estimated by the Bureau of Industry Economics that, per capita, New Zealanders benefit from CER around eight times more than do Australians. As a nation, we cannot afford to continue to carry economic refugees from New Zealand in our work force and thereby displace local workers. Whilst the impact of current policies is being felt markedly in the shearing industry, I believe it applies to other industries as well. Displaced Australian shearers are having to move to other areas which puts pressure on the workers in those particular areas. A system of work permits for New Zealanders should apply across the board. We must protect the award system against the tyranny proposed by those opposite. We must increase the financial penalties for award breaches and we must learn from the tragedy being played out in Victoria and New Zealand.

It is a total furphy to suggest that the New Zealanders were breaking award conditions. The AWU and people such as the honourable member for Kennedy have gone to great efforts to try to run that line. When it has been investigated, it has been found that award conditions have been adhered to, and that the shearing industry is working quite well.

        This whole debate really goes back to the arguments in May about the shearing industry and about award conditions. It is quite outrageous that Government members are putting forward this motion that there be a substantial increase in penalties, to ensure that employers comply with award conditions. There is no mention, of course, of the rights and responsibilities of the workers, and of what will be the penalties to the workers, if they do not obey the award conditions and do not help in the workplace. It is really just a policeman attitude: the employers will do exactly what the trade union movement wants them to do, and they will be forced to do so by penalties. This is very much against the current approach of the coalition's industrial relations policy, which is one of cooperation, increasing productivity, and making a more flexible workplace.

       In June 1991 the Department found compliance with award based superannuation was at a high level, around 80 per cent, and it has further increased. It is exactly as I have been saying. This was found by the market research carried out for the Department of Social Security earlier in that year by Brian Sweeney and Associates, of which I obtained a copy in an answer to a question on notice. The Department's award management section dealt with almost 200,000 requests for information on awards in 1990-91. The award officers—some would call them inspectors—visited more than 12,000 employer establishments, where 3,300 complaints about awards were raised. We can see from the information from the Department itself that awards were being looked at and were being complied with.

        I totally reject the suggestion that we need an increase in penalties just to ensure that the bosses pull into gear. Despite the best efforts of the ACTU to confuse matters, employees and employers are really in a contractual situation when they are at work. The duties of an employee are relatively straightforward. They generally have to work as directed, although in many industries so far the employees have unfettered rights because of union directives. Employees have to be courteous, they have to be punctual and they have to work to the best of their ability. In the more enlightened work situations they are encouraged to think of ways of improving work productivity.

        —Of course, now the Liberal Opposition in this Parliament is 100 per cent behind the Victorian Government. I am not surprised. Let us get this issue down to its simplest form: what is the industrial relations policy of the Opposition about? Let us not go on with this nonsense about wanting flexible working arrangements or co-operative situations between employees and employers. It is all about reducing wages; it is about this perception that the members of the Opposition have that people are paid too much and it is necessary for the Australian economy for wages to be reduced.

        That is why they are saying that leave loading is unnecessary and an outrage. The previous speaker, the honourable member for Corangamite (Mr McArthur), said that Australia was the only country in the world where people were paid more to go on holidays. That is actually factually wrong. Something like one-third of the countries in the OECD have holiday leave loadings, bonuses or other payments for employees on leave.

Let us decode this, let us cut through all the rubbish and the rhetoric. They are saying, `I want to reduce your wage by about 1.3 per cent'; it is as simple as that.

That is fine, of course, for a shift worker or a nurse or an occupation like that, where a large part of the income comes through the application of penalty rates. They are telling those workers that they want to reduce their wages and that that is going to be good for them and for Australia.

         Fightback!

What is going to be the outcome of the high road scenario? Their projection of productivity growth is 0.8 per cent annual growth. That is less than what they proclaimed to be the low rate during the 1980s. That is amazing. We are going to go through all this pain; we are going to reduce people's wages; we are going to have industrial confrontation; we are going to destroy the industrial system of this country, and our outcome, our shining achievement, is going to be a productivity outcome, at its best, with the high road scenario lower than what was achieved by Labor during the 1980s.

What was the answer of the leading Australian economists? Unemployment would be higher under the Opposition's Fightback policies than under the Government's policy. So all of that confrontation can take place; people's wages can be reduced; the industrial system which has produced low inflation and the lowest level of industrial disputes in this country in 30 years can be attacked; and what is the result? The result is more unemployment.

        Why are they proposing this? At the end of the day, it is made crystal clear by the activities in Victoria. At the very time that they were reducing people's wages, while they were knocking off leave loading, while they were cutting down on penalty rates, the same industrial relations Minister voted himself and the rest of his colleagues there a massive pay rise. They give themselves a pay rise and they take it off everyone else. They get silver service in their dining room and they get the Speaker to put on the wig and they put on their top hat and tails to go to the Melbourne Cup. It is the return of the old boys, the return of the people who were `born to rule'. At the same time, in their scenario, ordinary people's wages are cut so that we can have more profit and more money for ourselves. But do they achieve anything for the country? Do they get better productivity? No, they get higher inflation through their goods and services tax; they get lower productivity; and, at the end of the day, they get higher unemployment.

        The basis of all this seems to be that the honourable member for Kennedy has some kind of twist in the back of his mind that New Zealanders are stealing Australian jobs. That is true, but they are not stealing them on the farms in North Queensland, they are stealing them out of the factories in Victoria. Do honourable members know why? It is because New Zealanders have figured out how to become more productive. They have figured out how to develop an outward looking, dynamic manufacturing sector that adds value to products. Mark my words, in the next few years that little country over there, those two islands, are going to whip us and they are going to make us look silly when it comes to productivity.

        If we look at the latest OECD reports, we find that New Zealand's competitiveness has now placed it on the top of the ladder. It was a laughing-stock a few years ago, an absolute laughing-stock, but the OECD thinks New Zealand is getting its act together.

That is what honourable members opposite want to reintroduce into Australia.

        When there is a debate about penalty rates, the Prime Minister comes to the despatch box and talks about enterprise agreements, where penalty rates have been rolled into a base hourly rate. It does not matter what time of the week, what day of the week or what hour of the day people work; it is the base rate of pay that carries over. He brags about that as being an example of a modern industrial relations policy in Australia. I happen to agree with him. It is sensible and it is the kind of result that we like to see across the nation. But some 450 workplace agreements under this Government's system—and very few of those encompass a full-week spread of hours—would indicate that the Government's policy is just too slow. Do honourable members know why? Because this Government's policy says that an individual in this country has no rights; the only people that have rights are unions. They have monopoly power and control over the entire system and, believe me, they exercise it. Individuals have no rights under the system. The unions have all the power and all the control. Without change we will never achieve the flexibility that this country needs to become dynamic, outgoing and forward looking as we develop an economy that is relevant in the dying stages of the twentieth century.

There is also another aspect in that much of the employment in that industry is of a transient nature; people work there for a few months and move on. It is very hard for people to know what their entitlements are, and that makes it hard for those persons to then try to pursue their proper entitlements.

        The State governments do not do very much. They allocate very few resources to police State award provisions. Many of the requests we get deal with State award provisions. We then have to refer them to the State body or department concerned. Federally, through the Department of Industrial Relations and the arbitration inspectoral offices, there is investigation of complaints. According to the annual report of the Department of Industrial Relations, some 16,000 investigations were made last year for people covered by Federal awards. The great majority of those were recovered by voluntary rectification by employers of breaches of the award. In other words, the inspector was able to come to an agreement with the employer.

Inspectors often get disheartened when performing their tasks on behalf of Australian employees and their families. They often get disheartened because, when a case ultimately gets to court, there is a token penalty imposed. They cannot leave the system. The Department has received 16,000 complaints—that is only from people who have come to the Department seeking assistance—so there are 16,000 decisions to be made. That cannot be ignored.

There is a need for government to be involved in the protection of employees' rights. I want to stress that—this is going back to when the honourable member for La Trobe and the honourable member for Macarthur (Mr Martin), spoke—70 per cent of employees in the private sector are not in unions. Why do honourable members opposite labour on as though the salvation of the economy rests on hammering the other 30 per cent? Seventy per cent of people in the private sector are not in unions and yet the Opposition attacks the trade union movement.

        —The honourable member will keep. Firstly, the proposal is unfair. It does not seek to address the capacity of the AIRC to deal with recalcitrant employees, just employers. Secondly, it is naive. It takes no account of nor does it reflect any understanding of what is actually happening out in recession damaged Australia. Thirdly, it is anti-employment. When the Government, including the honourable member responsible for this piece of nonsense, continually crows about the need to cut the dole queues, it might do better to aid and encourage employers to employ, not impose yet more potential penalties on them for trying to do so.

        Finally, and ironically, the motion is counter-productive to the Government's stated objective of improving employment at the same time as keeping people in the system. I am sure that the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott) neither intended nor realised this potential, but the truth is that the result of the action that he is proposing would be to increase the push on the part of the employers in this country, and enlightened employees as well, to leave the very centralised system that he is so committed to. Maybe on that basis we ought to think about supporting the motion.

        To return to my first point, this proposal is simply unfair. Current penalties available for imposition by the AIRC are quite weak. Section 311 of the Industrial Relations Act 1988 allows for penalties, if an award or order of the Commission is broken, of just $500 in the case of a natural person or $1,000 in the case of a body corporate. It is the same for either side of the employee-employer divide.

        This motion flies in the face of the Australian values of fairness and mateship that the honourable member referred to at some length when he introduced his motion. To suggest that an employer who breaks an award or order should suffer a greater penalty than should an employee who does the same is unfair. Where is the fairness in that? It also flies in the face of a generally acknowledged fact in Australia that it is more often unions and their members who flout awards and orders. In fact, that is one of the reasons why the centralised system has lost so much credibility.

One major employer whom I knew in New South Wales sat down with his employees and said, `We are going to go broke if we can't find a more sensible approach to surviving this drought'. So they drew up a negotiated settlement which they had to keep secret from the union because it was illegal. However, the net result of that was that the company survived.

        —After listening to the rabble opposite I think it is about time we had some commonsense in this place. May 12 this year was declared a day of action on unemployment. Community, church and social welfare groups organised the date to direct the attention of the public and the media to the plight of Australia's growing number of unemployed, and to seek a commitment from members of parliament that they make the reduction of unemployment their top priority. We have seen little evidence that members of the Government have been prepared to do that. Today's unemployment figures once again will be testimony to this Government's lack of will to tackle the causes of the problem of unemployment. One suggestion to try to alleviate our unemployment crisis for young people in particular, and their suffering, however, arose from a meeting in Castlemaine in my electorate of McEwen: a system of voluntary national service for young unemployed Australians. On behalf of those people in Castlemaine I therefore move:

       The term `voluntary national service' is used to describe programs in which young people perform tasks that are not performed by either the private sector or government. Included in that category are activities such as home care for the elderly or disabled, conservation activities and work in non-profit human service organisations. The reasons for a scheme of voluntary national service vary. Some people see such a program in terms of the benefits it will provide to society as a whole. Others view it in the light of the value it will provide to those who participate, either in terms of training or in terms of the community spirit it generates in the youth involved. Whilst the two are not mutually exclusive, I want to focus today on the benefit that a program of voluntary national service will have for young unemployed.

      <para first-indent="16">
       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        Voluntary national service has the potential to help young people by providing them with skills while at the same time providing them with self-discipline and developing in them a sense of responsibility and self-worth. Indeed, it is a way of reducing that alienation that young people so often feel, and instilling in them a greater awareness of the society in which they live. Such awareness can be developed and fostered by providing young people of different social, cultural or economic backgrounds with new experiences, by exposing them to social problems or a side of life that they might not otherwise see.

        However, I believe that to determine the important role voluntary national service can play in Australia we need only look to what is happening to those young Australians who are presently unemployed and at the adverse effect unemployment is having on them. In Australia today 31.8 per cent of the population aged between 15 and 19 are unemployed. In fact, the unemployment figures which are to be released today are unlikely to show any marked improvement in that situation. Australia's young are facing bleak employment prospects and are being denied the opportunity to develop their skills and talents. They are obliged to take what little is on offer, whether or not it suits their ambitions or skills. In the rural areas of my electorate, where the youth unemployment rate is much higher, the situation is even more desperate. Many of the jobs that used to be available to teenagers, such as apprenticeships and farm work, are no longer available. Consequently they are forced to leave their homes to look for work in the city, but because of limited training and qualifications they face the prospect of being unemployed and homeless.

        The adverse effect on unemployment is incontestable. Unemployment impacts not only in a financial sense but often, more importantly, in a physical, emotional and mental sense. Studies have shown that psychological maturity is the result of a successful transition through a series of development stages—and one of the most important stages is work. But bear in mind that the longer people are out of work, the lower their chances of success in gaining employment. In fact, during the 1980s, on average, nine new jobs were created before one unemployed person obtained work, and 18 new jobs were created before one long term unemployed person obtained work. When one considers that this recession has already more than doubled the number of long term unemployed to over 300,000, the prospects are frightening—particularly for young people.

        In Sydney earlier this year, the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) convened an open and public meeting on youth unemployment. A range of speakers from a range of backgrounds came together to give their views and ideas on how the pain could be alleviated. The concept of voluntary national service was put forward by the Anglican Archbishop, the Right Reverend Peter Hollingworth. He wanted a civilian national service scheme covering 250,000 people to be introduced. He said:
       </tab>

      <para font-size="-=2">
       Through community service young people can be involved in the vital tasks of nation building and of knowing they are making an important contribution by participating in projects of national significance. Such a scheme, offering broader life experiences across cultural and class differences, can be of enormous benefit in breaking down barriers and helping understand one another. The scheme would provide a marvellous opportunity to develop that essential quality of teamwork which comes about when people live and work together in the pursuit of common goals.
      </para>
      <para>
       However, the Government has ignored that and many other sensible suggestions that were put forward on that day. Instead of trying to tackle the causes of youth unemployment, the Government decided to provide funding for short term programs, which in the past have had poor or dubious outcomes.

        What is really needed is for government to decide, based on changing demographics and changing marketplace, exactly what the Australian work force is going to be like in the next decade and develop education and training programs to provide our young people with those skills needed to match that very changing work place. The Government needs to develop long term plans, rather than more stopgap measures. A program of voluntary national service has the potential to become one of those long term plans and, with bipartisan support, it can work for the good of all young unemployed Australians.

They can be involved in work in parks, gardens, local hospitals, nursing homes—the agenda is unlimited. However, what I am proposing is not new. In fact, it is already happening in parts of my electorate, albeit on a smaller scale.

For some of those young people, it is the only work they have ever had.

        In conclusion, the problem of youth unemployment is one of the very serious problems that are affecting this country. Our young people are the key to the future of this country.

What has been put forward by the honourable member for McEwen is breathtaking in its simplicity in sound only, for in reality it is enormously complicated.

        Here we have a member of the Liberal Party of Australia talking about one coordinated scheme for the whole of Australia. One can imagine the complexity of the bureaucracy that would be involved in that. The cost of the bureaucracy would be enormous, because the bureaucracy would not work for nothing, as the honourable member wants the unemployed to do.

If the honourable member is going to put forward these schemes, I suggest she has a responsibility to put forward to the Government something which is workable. There is a more workable scheme, and that is simply to extend CDEP—which operates in Aboriginal communities—to the general community. We should let councils enter into CDEPs in which people collect the dole for the work they do. If they work for three days a week, then they get about the equivalent of award wages. In most cases, councils would have the administrative capability to look after these people if they were available on a consistent basis.

        If the honourable member for McEwen were to put forward a program like that, it would make a lot more sense. However, what she is putting forward is not one coordinated scheme because it relies on using the expertise and resources of local government. With the successes and failures of CDEP, a workable scheme could be sorted out because some local governments would do it very well and others would flounder, as they do at the moment, but at least we would have a model which could be copied.

        That other professional hand-wringer which the honourable member mentioned, the Right Reverend Archbishop Hollingworth, is a man who is continually bleating about the plight of the poor, but at the same time he is advocating high immigration into this country. It should be obvious to even the eminent archbishop that the two are contradictory. If there is massive unemployment, it will be compounded by bringing migrants into Australia, particularly as many migrants today are of the unemployable kind. If the archbishop cannot see how illogical his own stance is, then I suggest it does give some idea of the weight which we should attach to his views.

        —I agree entirely, and I think in this case the honourable member is absolutely right. I also hold those socialist values. I also believe in a planned economy. Honourable members on the other side of the House blindly advocate the idea of the level playing field, and so it is refreshing to hear at least someone on the other side, even though it is an obscure person, advocating that we do have government planning. More than that, we are also told that the Government needs these long term plans. What has happened to the level playing field? What has happened to the marketplace deciding it?

        Of course, the marketplace was always nonsense. It is slavish adherence to the marketplace by honourable members opposite and by this Government that is the main cause of unemployment in this country today. I can say now that there will be no full employment in this country unless we get manufacturing industry going. I was at a meeting this morning that was concerned with the great benefits of tourism, yet the Department of Finance officers could not tell us a figure for the net value of tourism to this country. It is significantly less than the $8 billion gross value that is attributed to it. Despite this, we have people saying to us that tourism is much more important than the wool industry. That is arrant nonsense. This country needs to be productive, it needs people producing things.

        How can this be achieved? I believe it can be achieved very easily if governments force their public servants, their bureaucrats, to buy locally when making purchases. Remember, even in the wildest of free enterprise economies, even in the feral economy that honourable members opposite contemplate, government will still be the single biggest buyer. Government will always be the biggest single customer. If government were to insist that public servants purchase products on the basis of the real through-life cost, then they would find that Australian manufactured equipment became much cheaper.

        I have been looking at examples recently which clearly demonstrate this. People in their mad passion to buy overseas products often buy inferior products. We can see engineering equipment coming out of Germany every day that is not a patch on the quality of Australian equipment, yet it is being bought by Australian industry, by Australian government departments and by semi-government authorities. If governments were to insist that the through-life cost, the real cost, be the criteria of purchasing, then there would be a lot more manufacturing in Australia.

        If there were a lot more manufacturing there would be worthwhile jobs for people, jobs where they can earn income and have dignity. Then they can make up their own minds whether they want to sit in hospices. I am sure there will be people who want to do that. I believe that the youth of today is no less compassionate than the youth of the past. I believe that we can motivate some of the middle aged people who are in a much worse situation than youth to get out and contribute their experience to society. But to put forward this program today as some form of salvation is really, in my view, a cop-out.

        When we are talking about national service, one of the things that we could look at as a government is the military. I am not advocating national service in the military because I do not think it is in Australia's defence interests. It is not wanted by the Australian Defence Force and it would require a substantial amount of extra spending on defence. But I think it would make a lot more sense if we were to utilise the resources of our military for construction projects in isolated areas.

        Opposition to this idea does not come from the unions, it comes from politicians and bureaucrats who believe that the unions would not cop it. I know very well that with proper negotiations unions would agree because they realise that there are benefits to the wider community. For instance, if the Army was to build a few bridges between Alice Springs and Darwin instead of digging holes and filling them in, sooner or later the Alice Springs-Darwin railway would be economically viable. I think that is the sort of thing that we could consider. After all, in the United States, the land of free enterprise, the Corps of Engineers is responsible for all United States internal waterways and it totally controls the operation and construction of all those waterways. I might add, it does so very well.

        I am a little disappointed in some of the comments of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell). First of all, he really has not addressed the motion. Secondly, the motion is certainly not a cop-out. This highlights the continuing adhockery and political point scoring that goes on in this place and outside it on issues that should have a more national perspective. I would agree that we do need a national manpower strategy plan, and I think that is in some ways what the honourable member was saying. Many of us are searching for solutions and, with due respect to the honourable member for Kalgoorlie, he has said nothing in this place this morning which would give me any confidence that he had the solution. I support the honourable member for McEwen in the motion and commend the motion to the House.

What he said back in March of this year on national service was that we needed `a range of activities, including community projects through to environmental activities'. He said:

        The basic question that we really need to ask this morning, in terms of this motion, is what we mean by national service. Of course, it would be a reasonable thing to say that national service means different things to different people. I would like to suggest to you this morning that national service is an ideal that encompasses a variety of often inconsistent ideas. The core of the concept, as I see it, is the conviction that the nation and its citizens would be far better off if more persons devoted a portion of their lives to some sort of public service.

      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        The various proponents of national service perhaps agree on that much but, outside the core conviction, there is clearly a lot of disagreement. Perhaps the three most significant disagreements concern whether programs should be voluntary—as the honourable member is suggesting this morning—or compulsory; whether they should benefit mainly the servers or the served; and finally, whether such schemes would be designed for the disadvantaged, or would indeed make special efforts and expenditures to engage targeted areas.
       </tab>
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        There is also disagreement about the age or the ages at which service should be undertaken. Here this morning, we are talking about youth, but I would say to the honourable member for McEwen that what we are suggesting here should not be restricted to youth. In fact, it applies far more widely to other age groups. There is disagreement about the length of service, and about the character of service activities. Of course, there is the traditional difficulty of the relationship between civilian and military service rates of pay. The degree to which national service should be centrally or locally planned and managed is something about which the honourable member for McEwen and the honourable member for Kalgoorlie have had something of an exchange.

        Indeed, it seems to me that national service cannot be assessed nor, in fact, really discussed, unless we are very specific about it; and that is where the difficulty arises. I have recently skimmed a very interesting book written in the United States, but nevertheless having Australian application.
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         National Service: What Would it Mean?
        </emphasis>
        was written by Richard Danzig and Peter Szanton six or seven years ago. In it, they reviewed the alternative programs of national service, some or most of which have an Australian application, although of course they are written in the United States environment.

        The first program, they suggested, might be school based, and would involve projects, et cetera within the schools. The second was draft based, and that is, of course, when we get into the military situation. I know that a year or so ago the honourable member for Farrer (Mr Tim Fischer) had something to say on that. I would like to read into the record this morning what he said:

      </para>
      <para>
       That, of course, is the broader issue that we are discussing this morning. The American study also talked about a third model, an evolutionary and voluntary model which involved the peace corps, environmental considerations, et cetera; and, finally, it referred to a universal model where everybody would have to make a contribution, whether in civilian or in military terms. They finished off by saying, and it is important in the context of this debate that they said this:

      <para font-size="-=2">
       We emphasise this point—

       not because no other specific programs have ever been proposed; many have. We emphasise it because we think the political temptation is to keep the debate unparticularized.

       That is exactly what is happening here this morning, and it is exemplified by the words of the honourable member for Kalgoorlie. There are problems, and we need to solve those problems. The motion before the House this morning goes some way, albeit not the full way, to providing that solution.

        —Whilst I think I have some understanding about the motives for what those honourable members opposite are putting forward here today, the fact is that the Government already has in place a range of employment and training programs that give young unemployed people essential skills which they need in order to compete in today's local market. The introduction of a national service would be counterproductive and unnecessary. It is important how matters have been put forward here this morning, with honourable members skirting around the defence aspect, because there does seem to be that underlying factor that, when you start talking about national service, the broad population out there does think about military service in the defence area. Whilst what they have said today is commendable, we need to understand that there is a motive behind it. I think it is very mischievous sometimes for honourable members opposite to speak as they have in this context this morning. This motion consists of two parts: the first directs the Government to investigate the use of voluntary national service, and the second provides that the House:

I would just like to make a few comments about the Ready Reserve, not to mention the Australian Defence Force itself, which is a voluntary force, of course.

It is just one of the Defence Force bases that actually participate in the Ready Reserve scheme, with 30 recruits who were trained as airfield defence guards already passing through Amberley. The Ready Reserve scheme is not only an important part of the Australian defence policy; it also gives people skills and experience that will serve them well in civilian life, as we all well know. The key to the success of the Ready Reserve program is the fact that it is strictly on a volunteer basis. The people who are in the Ready Reserve want to be there.

        However, service in the armed forces is not the answer as a youth unemployment program. While it provides very useful experience, this experience is, by its very nature, defence related. So the Opposition really does have a tendency of late to try to latch onto simplistic policy prescriptions for the problems faced by Australia today. These solutions, of course, act as a substitute for rational thought, which some of those honourable members opposite obviously do not have too much of. But what this country needs is action by government, not gimmicks such as the re-introduction of national service. If we were to listen to the Opposition, we would believe that all Australia's problems would be solved if we shoved the unemployed into the Army, made young people work for $3 an hour and taxed milk and bread at 15 per cent, while reducing the price of a Ferrari by $30,000.

Australians want governments to plan for recovery, and to introduce policies that directly address the problem of youth unemployment—and unemployment generally, of course, which we are doing. Rather than investigating the use of voluntary national service for young unemployed Australians, as this motion suggests, the Keating Government is implementing programs that will directly assist young unemployed Australians now, not at some vague time in the future.

        To understand why the introduction of voluntary national service is unnecessary and entirely inappropriate, let us look at the record of this Government in the area of providing training and employment opportunities for our young Australians. In July this year, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley) released a national employment training plan for young Australians. This plan sets out a series of programs that will offer training and long term career prospects for young Australians.

        The release of the plan followed the national meeting on youth unemployment that was held in Canberra on 22 July 1992. In this document, the Prime Minister gave a commitment to all long term unemployed young people that they would have the right to a six-month prevocational training course, with a Jobstart card on completion. The card would give any prospective employer a wage subsidy, if that employer hired a young person. By the end of 1993, 35,000 places will have been funded under this program.

        The Prime Minister also announced the creation of career start traineeships. These will be targeted to people who leave school earlier. They are amongst the most disadvantaged people in today's highly competitive labour market. Other important initiatives contained in the program include: an expansion of Skillshare and Jobtrain, with a link to wage subsidy for a job after training is completed; an increase in subsidies for existing traineeships and in support available for apprenticeships; the creation of an extra 12,000 prevocational TAFE places by the end of the next year; $43.6m until 1995 to introduce the Australian vocational certificate, as recommended in the Carmichael report; and the provision of $56.3m over the next three years to fund Carmichael pilot projects, as well as to help in the running of career start traineeships.

        One of the most significant measures in the national employment and training plan for young Australians was the announcement of a land care and environment action program. This program will not only give young people employment experience; it will also improve their long term career prospects. The program will also provide an invaluable service to the community in the form of environmental and conservation projects. When the Government was developing its youth employment strategy, it decided that a broad range of measures would be necessary in order to fully address this complex and difficult issue. It is a tragedy that around half the young unemployed are looking for a full time job for the first time. One of the most important factors an employer looks at, when considering a potential employee, is a person's past work experience.

        The great advantage of the land care and environment action program is that it not only provides employment experience to young Australians, it also addresses one of this country's most pressing national problems—land and environmental degradation. The land and soil degradation that has occurred over the past 200 years is a national disgrace and needs to be addressed. This problem not only has important environmental consequences, but it is also detrimental to Australia's long term economic interests.

        . Kelly sees the great era of Australian protectionism, which commenced with the humiliating political defeat of George Reid's free traders by Alfred Deakin's protectionists in 1902, as having been dismantled by the Hawke Government in March 1991. He waxes lyrical when he says:

       Kelly also sees the beginning of the end of the National Party with the schism that developed between the National Farmers Federation and the National Party in 1976. What Kelly is saying is that the NFF led a grassroots farmers revolt against the National Party and joined with the economic rationalists in the Liberal Party to embrace, on behalf of Australia's farmers, a free market philosophy that runs totally counter to the entrenched protectionist traditions of Page, McEwen, Anthony and Sinclair which have been the very essence of National Party ideology since the 1920s.

        Kelly sees the Nationals as a dinosaur, a relic of an era of agrarian socialism, embarrassed by their own philosophy but with no adequate response to prevent their political extinction. I mention this simplistic assessment not to denigrate the National Party but because Kelly seeks in the same breath to dismiss the Left of the Australian Labor Party which, while going along with the view that Australia has to get internationally competitive, still believes in some degree of protectionism.

        I am no apologist for the Nationals and I would hate anyone to think that anything I said would give them solace or support.

        Australians do not operate in the arid intellectual environment of elitist right wing think-tanks such as the Institute of Public Affairs or the Centre for Independent Studies but in the real world, which is divided into trade blocs where protectionism is being practised on a bigger and better scale than ever before. We all know that the Uruguay Round of GATT is trying to break down these trade barriers and that it would be very much in the interest of some Australian industry if protection barriers were dropped. On the other hand, the reality that the Keating Government has come to accept is that there are a lot of Australian industries that will go to the wall if some protection is not given to them, at least for the foreseeable future.

        More importantly, the electorate appreciates that the overseas trend is toward trade wars, not towards the lifting of barriers. Anyone who can read knows that the Bush Administration, with the tacit support of President-elect Clinton, has just escalated the North American bloc's long-running trade offensive against Europe. Australian voters are concerned with jobs and they know that the fanatical rush of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) to zero tariffs will put hundreds of thousands of Australians out of work and force tens of thousands of farmers off the land. Mindless adherence to policies of free market globalisation strikes few chords of sympathy in the psyche of the Australian voter. Whether the Paul Kellys of this world like it or not, the old Labor ideal and the old Country Party ideal still rate highly in the Australian ethos.

In particular, I raise a special problem of agricultural protection within my electorate which is of great importance to all Australians. I refer, of course, to the discussion paper by the Australian Quarantine and Inspection Service concerning the importation of fresh, frozen and cooked chicken meat and products from the USA, Denmark, Thailand and New Zealand. Those countries have been lobbying the Government to gain access to Australian markets for poultry meat products.

        Australia is currently free of the catastrophic effects of viral diseases which periodically annihilate chicken flocks overseas.

        Virulent Newcastle disease is endemic in Europe, Asia and America. It is incurable, vaccination is highly expensive and native birds are susceptible to the disease. In 1972 it cost the Californian Government $56m to clean up an outbreak. The AQIS position is that if chicken meat is properly cooked all the diseases will be destroyed. It is true that the virus can be thermally inactivated by very thorough cooking for long periods. However, the virus is very stable in the environment and readily survives outside poultry bodies in dust, feathers, packaging materials, faecal matter, soil, et cetera, and it survives for years.

        Improperly cooked product may be rejected on arrival in Australia, but its very arrival puts the whole industry at risk.

The varying size and density of the chicken portion would require different periods to properly inactivate the virus, which would greatly add to the cost and would be likely to encourage short cuts.

The Uruguay Round discussions commenced in 1986 and some six years later that process is still under way. We have seen much trauma during that period as a result of restrictions and opposition by the French farmers particularly, who represent only 6 per cent of the voting population in France but have an inordinate amount of political muscle in that country. The delegation was able to see the public of France participate in the referendum which was held on 20 September and to see just how close that vote to support the Maastricht Treaty on the unity of Europe was. Most of the resistance appeared to come from the farming community of France.

The most important thing in our discussions was that we were able to debate amendments to the provisional report in reply to the report on the activities of the OECD in 1991.

        Australia has a very important role to play in the future of the common agricultural policy, particularly as it relates to Australia's exports to the European Community. At the moment European Community consumers pay between 19 per cent and 52 per cent more for their food, which is of a lower quality than and not as contaminant free as Australian food. The right approach could open up markets for superior Australian food at competitive prices, and we do have a very good record in the quality of our agricultural produce in this nation.

        What I do advocate is that a three-pronged strategy should be taken to overcome the common agricultural policy. The first step includes continued discussion at a political level with the European Parliament, the Council of Europe. The next stage requires strong representations to the bureaucracy, the European Commission. The third phase would require a vigorous marketing strategy aimed at consumers. The consumers obviously do not recognise that Australia can be a very good provider of high quality food that is free of contaminants. There are some huge environmental problems throughout Europe. Australia, free from those problems, is able to supply top quality food into that market.

        I was interested in the comments by the honourable member for Robertson regarding the importation of chicken from, of all places, Thailand. I have had representations on this also. Can anyone imagine chicken coming into this country from Thailand, when our poultry industry is one of the most efficient industries in this nation? It is very streamlined, and it is very efficient and productive. To allow chicken meat in here from Thailand would be an absolute disgrace. Bendigo has regrettably suffered outbreaks of avian influenza on two occasions. As a strong poultry producing area, we recognise the dangers of bringing in that type of product from areas such as Thailand.

        I want to continue the comments that I made about the visit to Europe. We had the opportunity to talk to some of the consumer groups in Europe, and we met members of the European Union of Consumers. They were very supportive of removing protection and subsidies under the common agricultural policy. They recognised that Australia had a quality product to offer them. In our agricultural produce, which we could supply to the European Community and other countries throughout the world, we have a product which is free from many of the contaminants that are current in the European Community.

Authorities at that time had been unable to trace the contaminated food thought to be responsible. That indicates the seriousness of contamination and the strong position that it places Australia in. The quality of the food which we can supply to the world places Australia in a strong position in negotiations on trading with Europe and with other nations.

        There have been many hiccups and highs and lows in the negotiations to bring the Uruguay Round of GATT negotiations to completion. I note the sudden resignation of agricultural commissioner Ray McSharry, his subsequent reinstatement, and the powerful position that Jaques Delors, the President of the European Commission, has been playing in that role. I think that it is getting back on track again. I note with some interest that Mr McSharry has in fact been reinstated as the agricultural commissioner and Jaques Delors is taking a back seat in the negotiations. One would hope that now the negotiations can be continued with the United States on its export enhancement program and other issues, including oil seeds. I trust that these negotiations will be carried out satisfactorily, so that agricultural protection can be reduced. That would enable Australia to participate in a world trading situation with countries throughout the world, particularly Europe.

        The misinterpretation by the honourable member for Parkes of the correct way to go about this, which is the way Australians would like this Parliament to act on this issue, is reflected in many of the policies of the Opposition. How can it come up with policies that will divide Australia and say that these are what Australians want? Do Australians really want the division that the Opposition's policies will bring? They will mean divisions in education provision, inequality in provision of health care, and policies, including industrial ones, that will create division amongst Australians. That division will lead to inefficient industries that cannot compete with overseas countries. That is just as important as anything that overseas countries may do or that the GATT talks may achieve. The achievement in that area will count for little if Australians are not united and working together towards a better future.

        —I am delighted to be able to join in this debate. Like all members in this chamber, I was extremely disappointed when the most recent negotiations to finally bring an end to the Uruguay Round of GATT foundered, apparently through the intransigence of the French. Some internal, political considerations in France led to an attitude being taken by their negotiators which led to the negotiations not being completed. It was all the more disappointing given that, a few days beforehand, the indications coming out of the negotiations were that this round of negotiations, which seem to have been going on forever, were finally coming to some sort of a successful conclusion. I suppose it is ironic that the motion, as originally couched by the honourable member for Parkes (Mr Cobb), welcomes the initiatives taken by the European Community in calling on the United States to join in the talks when it appears, in the final analysis, that it is the Europeans who have caused the Uruguay Round to fail.

        This Government has a long history of promoting the cause of free trade. We do so not through any great belief in concepts of economic rationalism or free and fair trade on level playing fields but in the belief that a range of Australian industries—particularly our major commodities, our primary industries—have very efficient producers. We also have natural advantages, a highly skilled work force in this area and good products. If we are able to get reasonable access to world markets, we can successfully sell our goods and return very good export earnings for this country. It is in our interests that world trade be free. We are not pursuing that for some mad ideological outcome; we are pursuing it because it is in our interests to achieve these ends.

        However, that does not mean that we have not also been looking at various bilateral relationships. One only has to look through the negotiations and successful agreements that have been reached between Australia and various other countries, particularly in Asia, to see that we have improved our trade on a bilateral basis. It has largely been as a result of corrupt world markets that the prices we have been receiving for our exports have been considerably depressed, even though we are exporting at record levels. That applies to a whole range of industry sectors. I think that is proof that we have been successful in gaining access for Australian products in a range of new markets.

        That success would be doubled, tripled or even quadrupled if we were able to break down the insidious trade barriers and subsidy programs which are being practised, principally by the European Community and responded to by the United States. We do not have the capacity to attempt to match the sorts of subsidies that are being given out by much larger countries. It is pointless to think that we can go down that path. An alternative is to try to put in place very high trade barriers to prevent goods from getting access to our markets. But, at the end of the day, that will achieve us nothing in terms of being able to sell our goods overseas and earn export dollars. I think the Government is beholden, given that the chances are that the Uruguay Round will drag on for some considerable time—

Rather, they are people seriously concerned and angry about a calculated and vicious attack on the things that matter to them: their work and their rights. My office, down there in Wills, where 20 per cent of the work force is unemployed, is being inundated by calls from people worried about their work, their schools, their public transport and all the things they consider important to the quality of their lives. Teachers fear the loss of their jobs, and school communities are worried that schools will be closed without consultation and foresight.

All this, despite the fact that over the past decade the union movement could hardly have been more constrained.

That is why they were out on strike on Tuesday. Here we have a man, who claims to be concerned about family life and human misery, quite happy to endorse the actions of a government which did not have the courage to outline its policies prior to the election. It is intriguing how some conservatives, in the pursuit of political brownie points, shed tears over human suffering; yet when those very same people being victimised decide to take action the conservatives are quick to change their tune. Not once in his speech did the honourable member for Bennelong name those wanton speculators who took the money of ordinary people and disposed of it in the selfish, individualistic quest for personal gain.

         The Federal Government, for its part, has a responsibility to act to thwart these calculated attacks on the rights of working people. Since coming to office in 1983, the Government has twice flirted with the introduction of legislation designed to create a right to strike in Australia. In the Senate last week the Minister for Industrial Relations, Senator Cook, served a timely warning when he said, `There is no right to strike in Australia'.

         We need to ask why it is that after a decade of Federal Labor government there is still no right to strike in Australia. We should ask why it is that, when Australian workers move—almost always reluctantly—to defend their rights, they must expose themselves to an array of punitive laws and penalties. From sections 45D and 45E of the Trade Practices Act to actions under common law—as we saw in the 1890s, and most recently in the Dollar Sweets case—those people with the born to rule mentality have a host of laws at their disposal with which to shackle working people.

        Under the kinds of industrial relations policies proposed by the honourable member for Bennelong, Australian workers would have much to worry about. The destruction of collective bargaining and its replacement with an individual contract system would leave individual workers defenceless and working conditions decimated.

        The Prime Minister has spoken passionately about protecting the rights and wages of working people. Rhetoric, however, is not enough.

I think it is fair to say that the Geelong Hospital is one of the most efficient hospitals in Victoria, and it is probably one of the most efficient in Australia. It is a tribute to the management and leadership of the hospital, by several persons over a decade, and in more recent times under the leadership of Mrs Heath, who happens to be a member of the Liberal Party.

         Geelong Hospital has delivered health services to a community of close to 200,000 people, at a very high level and at a very low cost. The hospital has a dedicated staff who are committed to their tasks, and who depend on the hospital for their livelihoods. The reward for dedication and for leadership, and the reward Geelong receives for putting two of Mr Kroger's stooges into the State Parliament—stooges who will not do anything to look after the area—is that 80 of the people who work at the Geelong Hospital are to be sacked. The kitchen is to be closed, and a firm in Melbourne is to provide all the food for the hospital.

         This is in a town where the Liberal Party spokesmen only two months ago were telling us how they were going to look after Geelong and how Mr Kennett was going to be the Minister for Geelong. Well, 80 people at the hospital know where they stand with Mr Kennett and his mate Mr Gude. Mr Gude used to represent the area until the people woke up to him and threw him out. They know where they stand with their local members and they wish to God they could get rid of them. Certainly they would not vote for them today. Eighty jobs are to go from the kitchen.

         But it is worse than that. The pathology section is to be closed at the hospital and the service be available through private pathology clinics only. That means that low income earners will pay between 50 and 100 per cent more for their pathology needs than they have to pay at the moment. That is not of concern to Mr Kennett as his friends do not need that sort of support.

         The outpatients clinic will be closed with the same effect on low income earners. That is of no concern to the new Government. Beds are being removed from the hospital. Remember the stories we heard only a few weeks ago about waiting lists? In the major public hospital serving the 200,000 people of Geelong there will be fewer beds available because it is the aim of the new government of Victoria to reduce the amount of nursing hours available. It is taking beds out of the wards. Then, to go as low as possible, the hospital authorities have been ordered to reduce the standard of cleaning. They are to let the wards get a little bit dirtier to save money.

These policies will have an effect not only on people in the industrial field but on the majority of people in Geelong. People in Geelong are being told that their hospital is to be a test case, that it is to be destroyed for an ideological bent and to satisfy the greed of a few people in the health care industry.

         On 25 November 1986 the then Liberal member for Nedlands, Richard Court, raised a matter in the Western Australian Parliament relating to a WA Inc. entity called Exim and associated matters relating to its then managing director, Brian Easton, the husband of Penelope Easton. If press reports are correct, Mrs Easton, who was involved in divorce proceedings with Brian Easton, contacted Mr Court seeking information related to his statement which she wished to use in some aspect of that action. Mr Court is quoted as saying that he referred her to the public record, including, I presume,

Subsequent statements by Mr Easton admit that, notwithstanding the raising of this matter in the divorce proceedings, it eventually had no bearing on the decisions associated with that case. Nevertheless, sometime in 1989 Mr Easton raised the issue of Mr Court's involvement with the official corruption commission, which sought the assistance of the police. During 1989-90 Mr Easton was apparently informed that no case existed against Mr Court or against his wife.

She claims that, due to her elevation to Premier, she did not take the trip but forgot to return the money. A mere $5,000 floated around in her bank account for a couple of years, during which time I assume she lodged some tax returns but she was never apparently reminded of this substantial amount of money. Of course, this just adds to the record of forgetfulness that seems to be endemic in Western Australia's Premier. During the investigations of WA Inc. she has had no recollection—and this was when she was under oath—of any of her activities as a Cabinet Minister, notwithstanding that there were three very big deals approved by Cabinet, all of which have been disasters for the Western Australia taxpayer, when she was involved as a Cabinet Minister.

         The simple fact is that I charge the Premier with conspiring, and in a way that has caused a woman to commit suicide. I challenge her to go before some appropriate authority, presumably the Chief Justice of Western Australia, and sign a statutory declaration to say that she had no knowledge. She is the type of person who probably could do it, but there is a chance at least that lightning might then strike her dead.

         It is a disgraceful situation. It is one for which the whole Labor Party must take the blame. It is clearly a conspiracy to try to protect the Premier, and she is up to her eyebrows in it. Of course, Halden will just have to live with it. Penelope Easton took her own life and, according to her family, she took it because of the massive pressures on her and because of the direct attack on her that was necessary to make the thing have any substance.

         —Today I wish to speak about a part of an Australian industry which I think is badly in need of some micro-economic and social reform—that is, the advertising industry. In particular, I want to refer to an advertising campaign launched last week by the Queensland Tourist and Travel Corporation aimed at encouraging Australians to holiday in Queensland, which is of course a very laudable aim.

         This campaign is described as the `Yo! Way to Go' campaign, and it has attracted some immediate controversy. The first controversy was over the hijacking of American phraseology and American culture. The second, and probably the harshest criticism levelled at the campaign, was the way in which it portrayed women. There were two controversial scenes in the commercial. The first depicted a close-up of a woman wearing a G-string being sprayed with suntan oil. The second showed a woman being pinched on the behind. Upon being pinched, the woman turns around, smiles and shakes her finger in mock accusation at an unidentified male.

         It has been interesting to follow the course of this story over the weeks since the ads were launched. Despite being told to clean up their act, the Queensland Tourist and Travel Corporation and the advertising agency concerned have been completely unrepentant.

         The QTTC Chairman, Mr Peter Laurance, accused the State Government of being `hypersensitive' to what he intriguingly described as `women's issues' and `many other minority groups'. It may have passed Mr Laurance's attention that women are not really a minority, since they constitute more than 50 per cent of the Australian population. Asked to comment on the bottom pinching incident, he likened the action to `holding hands' or `kissing in the corner' or `winking at your girlfriend'. He is apparently unaware of the laws in this country dealing with assault, not to mention various sex discrimination legislation across the country. Having dismissed the controversy as being both absurd and ridiculous, Mr Laurance took comfort in the fact that at least the ads had not been criticised for being bland and unnoticed. In his opinion, the controversy ensured that the campaign would be a success before it had even been officially launched.

         The General Manager of the QTTC, Mr Ken Rosebury, was similarly unrepentant about the whole thing, stating that the offending scene had been removed in the interests of keeping the peace. Like Mr Laurance, he considered that the main objective was for the ads to stand out, so that they sold Queensland to southern tourists. I do not know whether it is exactly the way in which many people want Queensland to be portrayed, but I certainly will concede that the ads have stood out.

         The advertising agency responsible for this campaign is the company known as Mojo, which I think is fairly well known in the advertising business throughout Australia. It said that the ads were quite okay in its view and reflected real life. When one sees the models in the ads, one might wonder how many Australians actually look so glamorous, taut, trim and terrific. Unfortunately, some of us do not quite meet that ideal, and I do not really know how much the ads reflect real life. I know there are some honourable members present who always fit that model, with their splendid dress sense! The QTTC adopted the old show business adage that any publicity is good publicity.

         There are some interesting insights to be gained from this whole debate. There have been some fairly significant social changes in Australia which do not seem to have penetrated the minds of many advertising executives or the advertising agencies in this country. Probably the most significant change is that, over the last few decades, the number of women aged 15 or over who are now engaged in the paid work force has grown from 42 per cent to 52 per cent—that is, a majority of Australian women are in paid work. Research has shown that these changes in the participation rate have very much changed the perceptions of how women view themselves and other women.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         But whilst these changes have had significant implications for advertising, it seems that many agencies seek to ignore them. Research by Saulwick, Weller and Associates in 1987 found that as many as one in seven television ads showed scantily clad females; one in 10 used sex to promote a product; and one in 20 featured women whose clothing was considered inappropriate for the product advertised.

         Of course, there are some exceptions to the rule. One of the best examples, I believe, is the ads run by the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation featuring their short cuts product. I think that honourable members may be familiar with the sorts of images portrayed by those ads, which are very much in stark contrast to the sort of 1960s style of ads now being run in Queensland for the Tourist and Travel Corporation in the `Yo! Way to Go' series.

         The real test of an ad's effectiveness is the response of the consumer. In this regard, opinion polling suggests that the advertising industry still has a fair way to go. In 1989 a major survey of Australian women showed that half of them thought advertisers should use models who are more like real-life people, 74 per cent objected to ads which show women in skimpy clothing, and almost a quarter said they would boycott a product if they did not like the advertisement for it. The same survey found that the three most common words used to describe the depiction of women in ads were `glamorous' by 76 per cent, `thin' by 75 per cent and `sexually available' by 59 per cent. Similar research was conducted by Julie Bailey of Griffith University last year. She found that 87 per cent of Australian women think that ads show women as valued for sex at least some of the time, and 86 per cent think that it is far too often.

         Such polling reflects an increasing consumer irritation with the way in which women are portrayed in advertising. Australia is not alone in this regard. In 1983 a review of opinion polling in the United States on sex stereotyping found that a majority of consumers felt that advertising was insulting to women, and this in turn affected women's purchasing patterns. We should remember that women on the whole are responsible for major purchasing in Australia; yet again this fact does not seem to have seeped in to the minds of many advertising agencies. The United States research concluded that certain ads alienated female viewers, resulting in fewer sales and greater public criticism of the advertising industry.

         I do not have much cause in this House to agree with the comments being put forward by National Party figures, particularly the Leader of the Opposition in Queensland, Mr Borbidge, but on this occasion I am in agreement with him. Mr Borbidge has argued that the Queensland Government should have taken much stronger action against the Queensland Tourist and Travel Corporation over this particular series of ads. Mr Laurance is responsible for the campaign. I object to the ads, and Mr Laurance's response after the criticism was made has led me to have very little confidence in him. I agree with Mr Borbidge that he should be removed from his position.

         It is not good enough that we rely on the same old stereotypes of decades ago. There really should be some close thought on the part of the advertising agencies in this country about the sorts of messages that they are portraying. If there is a case for a major shake-up of an industry to get some proper reform into it and bring it up to modern day attitudes in the way in which it is making its products, I think that the Australian advertising industry would be a prime candidate for such scrutiny.

         The one thing that has distressed me in today's grievance debate has been that no-one from the Government has dealt with what I think should be the one subject causing us all most distress on this day. That is the fact that today the unemployment figures indicate that we have reached a postwar record level of 11.3 per cent or, measured in terms of male unemployed, an astonishing 11.9 per cent of males out of work, with the total figure conservatively estimated at barely short of one million people.

I am not claiming for a moment that the Opposition has a monopoly on concern for the unemployed but I do believe that, with all that the Opposition has done to build a package for an alternative direction for Australia, the criticism that can be levelled at the Government is that that package has met with nothing but scorn and derision.

         We do not want to be here, we want to be on the other side. If that is the case, every parliamentarian and every Australian should ask themselves why an opposition, desperate to win government, would hand down a package that was as frankly unpopular and lacking in pragmatism as the Fightback package is. Why hand down a package that the Government could, if it wanted to in a cheap and unproductive way, pour scorn and derision on? If we are to be a responsible, alternative government, we have no choice. We cannot continue as a nation while our overseas debt continues to rise—it is sitting at $160 billion or $170 billion dollars, depending on how we calculate it. We cannot continue in the present direction, with unemployment at 11.3 per cent and productivity falling.

         For that reason, the Opposition has said that the nation needs a new direction—popular or unpopular. We have handed down specific detailed proposals to change the tax regime, to change the industrial relations regime and to provide real opportunities for transport and waterfront reform. We have not done it by pretending that everything the Government does is wrong. Take the issue of tariff reform, for example: we have agreed with the Government on that. It would have been much easier, much more popular and much more pragmatic to have disagreed with the Government, but we have chosen the unpopular course of agreeing with it.

In the debate that preceded this grievance debate, the honourable member for Oxley (Mr Les Scott) accused the Opposition of, of all things, being simplistic with its solutions. Simplistic! He then went on to say that under the Opposition's package bread will go up in price by 15 per cent and Ferraris will come down. Such a simplistic misrepresentation of our package as that is without parallel. The reality, of course, is that foodstuffs do not go up 15 per cent. There will certainly be a goods and services tax applied, but its effect will not be to increase the cost of foodstuffs or essentials by 15 per cent. The goods and services tax will be offset by the removal of seven other presently existing taxes.

          It is my deep regret that in my home State of Victoria, where a change of government meant that that was an option which should have been available to the Premier, that did not occur. I do not have any doubt at all about the capacity of the average Victorian to tighten his belt and to make some level of sacrifice to get his State moving again. There was an opportunity for the newly elected Premier to show some sense of statesmanship to unite the Victorian community on the basis of understandings and a sharing equally of the burdens that have to be faced in getting the Victorian economy moving again. But what we have seen is an exercise in industrial confrontation from a government that could not wait to give itself its own pay increases, its own additional benefits, while taking away from average workers in Victoria hard won rights, hard won benefits, and at the same time promising to proscribe their defence of those rights, their defence of their working entitlements, by proscribing them in terms of the criminal law. The result, of course, was that we saw some 100,000 people marching on the streets of Melbourne. What is interesting is that the

What the honourable member for Gippsland wants to ignore is that two archbishops—I do not know how he would characterise them—have already indicated that they regard the right to strike as part of the inherent fabric of a democratic community. The only time I have ever heard the honourable member for Gippsland or some of the other gentlemen opposite support the concept of the right to strike was when Lech Walesa jumped the fence at the Gdansk shipyards and Solidarity was born, and the trade union movement fought to establish its right to bring democracy into Poland.

          Do honourable members opposite seriously believe that legislation can be introduced which criminalises actions which have been part of the inherent birthright of every Australian citizen, and that the living standards of the Australian people can be attacked in this way? I think it has to be conceded that clearly the Premier—and the Victorian Government—did not think his way through this concept. In one fell swoop with his initial legislative package, he sacked an entire jurisdiction of judges, who had been appointed for life to the Workers Compensation Board in Victoria.

          Fortunately, saner counsel seems to have prevailed and members of the legal profession, including prominent members of the Liberal Party, pointed out to him that one cannot go around attacking the judiciary and one cannot go around sacking judges who have been appointed for life. So there has been another attitude adopted, and I am pleased that there has been that change. But equally, in the same action, the Victorian Government originally proposed to take away from a worker the right to sue in tort for damages for negligence if he is injured in a serious industrial accident where he has to prove in our courts that the action was due to the negligence of the employer. That has also been reconsidered as a result of representations from the legal profession.

          At the same time, the Premier produces legislation that says the same worker, if he exercises his right to industrial action, can be sued in tort for an unlimited and unspecified set of damages. The problems of Australia will not be solved, nor will the problems of Victoria be solved, by dividing the community into those who have and those who have not, by bringing in legislation which does not belong to contemporary Australian society but is a regression back to those days when there was a wealthy class and a class basically without rights—an underclass.

          I do not want to see, and I do not believe any honourable member of this House wants to see, the creation of a new underclass in Australia but that is the trap that we are in great danger of falling into. It is not good enough for honourable members opposite for reasons of political prejudice to look at decent honest Australians, the sons of those who were Anzacs, the sons of those who fought for this country—and the daughters—and say that their perceptions of their rights are any less than the rights that their fathers fought for. I would hope that, if this coalition is serious about industrial relations, it will use its influence to persuade the Premier of Victoria that the course that he is embarking upon not only is divisive but also will destroy any potential for the Victorian economy to recover and at the same time will do great damage to the Australian economy.

         —I would like to bring to the attention of the House a matter which has arisen in my electorate of Gippsland which bears on the application of the Family Law Act and which raises serious questions as to the Act's capacity to ensure the Family Court exercises its powers fairly and justly in all its dealing in disputes between citizens. I fully realise the strictures imposed on me by way of section 112 of the Family Law Act in addressing this matter publicly. For this reason, I will have to beg the House's indulgence if I refrain from identifying the relevant parties by name, although I hasten to add that my constituent would gladly allow his name to be publicly broadcast, to give an even more human dimension to his tragic circumstances. Frustratingly for him, the Family Law Act prevents him telling his story in a media which demands personal identification in stories such as I am about to outline.

         Naturally, I would concede that there is no more difficult area in which to exercise legislative or legal authority than in regard to the relationships that exist between men and women in the community. Any institutional mechanism for intervening in and overseeing divorce proceedings, the disposal of property between parties in personal conflict and, most important of all, for assigning custodial rights in respect of children as a consequence of marital breakdowns or the dissolution of long standing relationships, is destined for a hard road. Yet the circumstances of one of my own constituents in Gippsland does require that the legislative process give closer regard to the operation of the Family Law Act.

         In 1986 my constituent married a woman of South African-Indian descent, a result of a relationship which was born of a chance meeting when both were travelling in India earlier in that year. Together with my constituent's wife's daughter from a previous relationship, the couple lived in East Gippsland over the course of 1985 and late into 1986. During this period, the couple had a son.

         Regrettably, the relationship between my constituent and his wife deteriorated over the period to late 1986, and the couple subsequently separated. Almost immediately following separation, there were numerous applications for access and custody lodged with the Court with respect to the children. Restraining orders were also invoked to ensure that the son, who was an Australian citizen, would not be removed from Australia. A subsequent order was made to this end, by consent, in February 1987.

         As of April 1988, orders were again made by consent that both parties would share joint guardianship of the children, whilst the mother would hold custody. These orders detailed access arrangements, including access to South Africa, and placed close restrictions on the son's travel to South Africa, the original homeland of my constituent's late wife.

         Further disputation followed in December concerning allegations that the orders affecting access had been violated and my constituent's wife was in contempt of court. In that same month, my constituent filed for sole custody of the two children. Three years later, after the separation, in the heat of the custodial battle, allegations were made that my constituent had interfered with his step-daughter. These allegations were never pursued to any extent and were not given any marked weight in the subsequent hearings of the Family Court. Similar allegations were later made that my constituent had molested his young son. These allegations were also never proven and were clearly viewed by the Court as having something far less than primary essential significance.

         In a tragic turn of events, my constituent's wife died as a result of a car accident in February 1991. Custody of both children was transferred in the interim to my constituent's wife's mother, who had journeyed from South Africa in the sad event of her daughter's death.

         The final Court judgment was handed down in the latter half of 1991, and custody of both children was transferred to their grandmother. Subsequently, my constituent's son who, I would remind the House, is and remains an Australian citizen—along with his half-sister, with whom, as I understand, he has little affinity—returned to South Africa in the company of his grandmother.

         The Court's order, it should be noted in this regard, permitted my constituent access to his son, and the grandmother was required to enter a bond to ensure the orders were fulfilled to the Court's satisfaction. Tragically, my constituent has now found that he is unable to enforce the Australian Court orders in respect of access to his son in South Africa, as the South African courts do not respect foreign court orders. In order to gain access to his son, my constituent is now pursuing very expensive legal avenues for redress through the South African court system.

         Several important queries arise out of this judgment, to which I would wish to draw the House's attention. Before doing so, I would hasten to point out that the concerns I will shortly raise are not simply applicable to a specific case before the courts. They bear, instead, on very much wider matters and ought to be considered as issues of principle against which the authority of the Family Court should be appropriately reviewed.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Firstly, I question whether the Family Court should be empowered to permit the person who has been awarded custody to remove the child permanently from the country of which the child is a citizen, especially when the judgment included access provisions for the other parent remaining in Australia. This point is of even greater significance when it is understood that the Court allowed the guardian to remove the child, an Australian citizen, from Australia to a country in which its own orders in respect of custody could not be enforced.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         What might be the logic of such a determination by the Family Court? Is this a practice to which the Parliament would happily accede, especially if it means the effective forfeiture of a child's citizenship? On what basis of law or other principle can the Family Court, through its determinations, effectively transfer a child's citizenship?

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Secondly, is it a legitimate practice that a child should effectively be removed from the custody of his or her only surviving natural parent and placed in the custody of a very much older relative with whom the child has next to no acquaintance? The importance of this point cannot be underestimated. My constituent's son is now required, as a six-year-old and an Australian citizen, to adapt to a lifestyle in a foreign country, in a community and within a broader culture with which he has little familiarity. In addition, he is now living in a so-called family environment which provides few, if any, of the essential interactions we would expect of a normal childhood.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Thirdly, are such decisions as these by the Family Court reached on a thorough assessment of the suitability of the environment into which the child is to be placed? I raise this point because the locality in which my constituent's son is presently required to live is not only emotionally deprived but also politically unstable and potentially violent. It affords a lifestyle and an educational environment which, on the evidence before me, would not be tolerated in Australia. This is the point of concern. The Family Court ostensibly reached its verdict on the basis of the familial and social environment in which the child's welfare would be best served. But what is the working requirement on the Court to investigate the actual environment to which the child is being relocated as opposed to the representations of that environment which are made before the Court?

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         In the case I refer to, it needs to be investigated whether the Court should undertake a detailed analysis of the conditions to which the child was being transferred prior to making a determination to this end. Honourable members with experience in the law know well that the legal system works well when it is right, but something less so when it is believed to be in error. It is incumbent on the legal process to constantly seek to improve its operation, to scrutinise its weaknesses and improve on its administration. Family law is no different from any other branch of law in this regard.

         I, for one, am tired of the prevailing mood of the judiciary, and even of the legislature, that the Family Law Act is so sacrosanct that to dare question its judgments is tantamount to contempt of court. The judgments of every other court are intensely examined and debated, and judges at times are criticised, but not the Family Court. An Australian citizen can be sent out of Australia and away from his father to totally unsuitable surroundings and there is nothing he can do about it. Any application of commonsense in this judgment would conclude that the child should not have been sent to South Africa. He is an Australian citizen, for heaven's sake, with family here.

         I am pleased that the Parliament has sought a review of the operation of the Family Law Act through the Joint Select Committee on Certain Aspects of the Interpretation and Operation of the Family Law Act, but the terms of reference are very narrow. I have brought these and related concerns to the Committee's attention in greater detail than I have outlined in the short time available to me today. I hope the Committee addresses the matters of principle I have raised in this report.

In the case of the major employer in the Illawarra, BHP, and other employers in the area, the coalmines and so on, since 1983 we have seen a major structural adjustment take place in our area to the extent that, whereas in 1983 there were 23,000 people directly employed in the steel industry, that figure is now 7,500 and it is set to go down even further. In the coal industry some 3,000 coalminers have lost their jobs. But productivity has gone up, new equipment has been put in place and the steel industry and the coal industry on the south coast in fact have been saved from extinction.

The boost that will give is valued at many millions of dollars in terms of the construction industry, and it also means that ongoing jobs for carers and so on will be created in the region.

         —I want to congratulate the Buchanan Aircraft Corporation in my electorate for achieving another milestone in its contractual work for the Australian Submarine Corporation in Adelaide. Last Monday saw the shipment from Toowoomba of the first set of composite hull casings for the six Collins class submarines being built in Adelaide. This is a unique achievement in engineering, commercial and transportation terms by the fledgling Buchanan Aircraft Corporation, which is establishing itself as a dependable contractor in the high-tech and untested area of composite plastics. It says much for local ingenuity and precision engineering.

         Buchanan's work force has trebled over the last two years, to a point where 55 local employees are now involved in this important $12m contract. I congratulate John Buchanan and his work force for a job well done in a difficult economic climate. I wish them continuing success in an enterprise that is very important both in local and national terms. Buchanan Aircraft Corporation and its workers can hold their heads high. They are important contributors to our enhanced national defence industrial infrastructure which is so important to our strategic circumstances.

         —In recent days in this place, the annual report of the Civil Aviation Authority for 1991-92 has been tabled. On page 14, under a report on the Australian advanced air traffic systems, the report says that the Authority was satisfied that it had received all essential information in a fair and unbiased way before arriving at a decision to award a contract. The Authority went on to say that, to satisfy the concerns of some members of parliament and Hughes Aircraft, the board had decided to establish an independent review of the evaluation process. That review is chaired by Ian Macphee.

         To correct the public record, that particular inquiry was not instigated by the board of the CAA. It was brought about by the pressure of the Joint Standing Committee on Public Works, through extreme pressure exerted on two Ministers. The honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) and the honourable member for Groom (Mr Taylor) did that work. Finally, the two Ministers very reluctantly decided to have that inquiry. The Macphee committee report is due in this place in a very short time, I understand. I hope it is not complete dynamite for the CAA.

         —I welcome a decision by the Government not to phase out tariffs completely. A petition of nearly 9,000 signatures, which has just been presented to the House, reflects the disadvantage of a broad approach to tariff cuts. In supporting lower tariffs, both sides of parliament have overlooked some important issues about canned food. Food is important enough to be completely under Australian control. That means that inspections should be much more frequent and that importers should have to pay for it.

         The recent rejection on health grounds of a shipment of tuna after a visit by the Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths) to the Heinz cannery in Eden confirms the need to do that. Food canning is labour intensive. Tariffs should not be used to protect inefficiency, but they should be used to protect living standards.

         The coalition proposal for no tariffs at all is worse than Labor's phase-down to 5 per cent and 2 per cent for developing countries for tuna. The combination of having a GST, effectively a tax on wages, in place of a payroll tax and opting out of wages awards—both Liberal-National Party policies—would hurt the workers far more than the present arrangements.

        One interesting comment came from the member for Lowan in the Victorian Parliament, Mr Bill McGrath. He slammed what he said was the `Federal Government's preparedness to slash rural research and development'. Who is Bill McGrath today? He is the Minister for Agriculture in the Victorian Government, and he has that headline against him in a Herald and Weekly Times publication last week. That is the Victorian Government's position. It is prepared to criticise us over a speculation of slashing research and development, but it is into the cutting of research and development up to its neck.
       </para>
       <para>
        The headline in fact says, `Jobs slashed for research', indicating that jobs may go from the 2,000-strong bureaucracy in order to maintain and expand research and extension. The Victorian Minister for Agriculture also recently announced a $13.2m private sector funding boost for the State's research program over the next three years. What a tangled web we weave when we practise to deceive. The Minister for Primary Industry and Energy has either intentionally misled the House, did not read the article, or was very poorly advised.

         Contrary to what the CAA has stated on page 14 of the report, the inquiry was set up by the Minister for Shipping and Aviation Support (Senator Cook) following a recommendation by the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, of which I am Chairman. I spelt out the need for the inquiry in a speech in the House on 3 June 1992 following the Committee's inquiry into the proposed air traffic services centres in Melbourne and Brisbane.

Amongst those 230 Australian tourists is a constituent of mine who was due home on a flight last Saturday morning. The flight was delayed, supposedly because of mechanical problems. The passengers were then told on Tuesday that the reason for the delay was that the airline did not pay handling fees and the plane had been impounded.

But I impress on the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Mr Martin) that he should take up this issue as a matter of urgency. These people are under great duress in Sofia, Bulgaria, and I ask that he take that matter up as a matter of urgency with Senator Evans. Here is an opportunity for Senator Evans to show his mettle as a Minister and bring that matter to a speedy conclusion so that those Australian residents can be returned to their homes in Australia.

         It just shows the level of cooperation in the community with the Blue Nurses and the Meals on Wheels organisation working together to assist our elderly people to remain in their own homes, which they often prefer to do rather than move into nursing or hostel accommodation. I think it is to the great credit of this Government that it has been able to provide these sorts of services to elderly people to ensure that they can live the life they wish to in their own homes, provided they have support such as this respite centre. It provides day care from time to time and, in conjunction with the Woogaroo Meals on Wheels, it provides meals as well.

There is a lack of faith in the institutions of the country, a lack of trust in the leaders and a lack of hope for the future. The sale of Qantas, approved almost unanimously by this House, reinforces all of these views. Qantas is more than just an airline, it is a symbol of national pride and confidence in the future. It was built up by the efforts of several generations of Australians, but it has now fallen victim to a decade long frenzy of deregulation and national assets liquidation presided over by this Government. It comes at a time when the United Kingdom lies in social and economic ruins as a result of the same policies and when the USA has jettisoned Reaganomics for a more interventionist approach.

         The GST will kill off the Australian tourist industry immediately. I calculated that each child who visits this House pays somewhere in the vicinity of $205. That is their total cost. But I calculated that when GST is added to their bus fare, their accommodation and on their food it is going to increase the cost to every child who visits this place by about $65. I want all of those people who are sitting in the gallery who travelled to this place from country areas throughout the State and from other States to understand that the GST is going to add $65 to the cost of their visit to Parliament House.

         —to provide equal opportunity for women in obtaining access to jobs at any level. In relation to more jobs, this Government has been vastly more successful than the Government that it succeeded. In relation to women, we have increased employment by 930,000 in 9 1/2 years—a 40 per cent increase in employment for women in the period that this Government has been in office. This compares with a total increase in employment for men and women of about 325,000 in the period of the Fraser Government. So it is a vastly greater performance in relation to employment for women under this Government. The female participation rate has increased from 44.6 per cent to 52.1 per cent. Obviously, there is a much greater proportion of women now looking for jobs. Of course, there is a much greater level of employment for women overall.

         In regard to more opportunity for women, we have taken many steps to improve that opportunity and to give women a better quality of job. Obviously, the Sex Discrimination Act is important in outlawing discrimination against women in the workplace. The Affirmative Action (Equal Opportunity for Women) Act is designed to encourage private sector employers and higher education institutions to introduce policies to enhance the position of women in the work force. Those employers have taken many steps to do those things: improving the flexibility of hours; providing employer based child-care; part time work; campaigns against sexual harassment; encouraging women into non-traditional employment areas; career break schemes; actively encouraging women to return to work after maternity leave, and so on. There are many examples of the kinds of things that are happening in the work force today. A similar thing is happening in the public sector under the equal employment opportunity program.

         In regard to conditions of employment, women have benefited greatly from the pursuit by this Government of policies such as the minimum rates adjustment process, which was part of the award restructuring initiative of a few years ago. This resulted in substantial pay increases for many low paid women. When we came into office 24 per cent of women had superannuation. The latest figures show that as a result of award superannuation and now, of course, the changes which have been taken further by the superannuation guarantee charge, we have 72 per cent of women with superannuation. Unpaid parental leave has also been introduced as a result of this Government's support and the accord.

         Of course, there have been major changes through education, child-care and training. In relation to child-care, we have had over a fourfold increase in the number of child-care places—an increase from 46,000 to 193,000 places. There has been a 77 per cent increase in the number of women in tertiary training. Women now have 70 per cent of traineeships. There are all sorts of indications of women's position in the work force being greatly improved under this Government. The overall figures show that that improvement is, in fact, eventuating.

         In relation to wages, we see that in regard to full time, adult, non-managerial work the ratio of female pay to male pay has improved from 87 per cent in 1983 to 92 per cent this year. In regard to managerial and professional work, women represented 31 per cent of the work force in 1986; they represent 35 per cent of the work force now. Clearly, their position is improving substantially as our policies bear on the problem.

         In the context of all of this, one should look briefly at what the Opposition would do. Under Fightback we see that the Affirmative Action Act, which has been so important, would be greatly damaged by the fact that the Opposition would abolish the Affirmative Action Agency. The Opposition says that it would still pursue the Act because it would require the Department of Industrial Relations to do so. However, it would halve the variable expenditure of the Department of Industrial Relations. It would chop $79m out of it. The Opposition would then tell the Department to do the things that it did before, plus administer the Affirmative Action Act. What a joke! Obviously, that Act would be gone.

         The Office of the Status of Women is listed as an agency which would be reduced or absorbed. Clearly, that would be at least downgraded. Child-care would be subject to a 15 per cent GST. We noted from the Opposition's industrial relations policies that the policies of taking away the safety net of awards would be greatly damaging to women. Most important, and most surprising perhaps, is the fact that the Opposition is pursuing a policy of rewriting history. I refer here particularly to a speech given by the Leader of the Opposition in July this year.

        This blinding flash of insight did not extend to his knowledge of history. In the same speech he said that in 1972, the McMahon Government passed the historic equal pay for equal work legislation. There was no such legislation. What we had in 1972 was a major development for women in the work force in Australia. It was the introduction of equal pay for work of equal value. That came about by a case that was taken by the trade union movement in the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission which the McMahon Government opposed. Now the Leader of the Opposition is trying to stand up and say that it was responsible for it.

I remind the Prime Minister that during the 1982-83 recession, and even in this Parliament as late as 1985, he and other senior Ministers used the word `depression' to describe the economic downturn in 1982-83. The Treasurer referred to it as the `devastating depression', at a time when the unemployment rate was 9.7 per cent. The Minister for Finance described it as a `vast depression' at the time when the unemployment rate was 9.4 per cent. The Prime Minister himself described it in the following terms:

        I ask the Prime Minister:  if depression was an appropriate description of 1982, surely it is an even more appropriate description today, given the circumstances in which you have left this country, with 11.3 per cent unemployment and massive pain and misery and hardship?  By the way, I ask you to withdraw the statement that my remarks were treacherous.

         This is the person who maintains that he stands for one thing—his absolute determination to call it the way it is, to call for what needs to be done, irrespective of the short term political consequences. Not mentioning sugar once to the Mackay Regional Development Bureau, he sure did not call it the way that the Mackay industry wanted to see it, particularly having told the Nationals in his own party room that the tariff for the sugar industry would be reduced to zero.

         In conclusion I say this: the fact of the matter is that there is growing concern among people in the bush about what Fightback and the GST are going to do to them. Farm organisations are increasingly questioning what they have been told. Gone is the day when those on the other side, particularly from the National Party, can go out there with a smile, a hat and a pork barrel and pretend that the issues are not there, that all the complexities will be dealt with when they get into office. They want answers. They want to know how a 15 per cent goods and services tax will help them. They want to know how a zero tariff will help them. I might say that I think they know the answer.

         But they do not come to this issue with clean hands. As the Prime Minister has asked a couple of times already today, would the policies which they would pursue and which they are vigorously advocating for Australia make the question of unemployment better in the sense that they would create jobs? The answer clearly is no. What they want is a contraction of the Australian economy. The Leader of the Opposition got up here a few nights after the Budget and said he advocated taking $7 billion out of the economy. What does he think would be the consequence of that kind of a policy for Australia?

         —What this Government has been concerned to do has been to build in some certainty as to the level of funding which States receive from us either in the form of financial assistance grants or in the form of special purpose payments. I think we have got to a stage between the Commonwealth and the State governments where there is a greater degree of certainty in the level of financial assistance coming from the Commonwealth to the States than there has been for a very long time. Any changes to those arrangements can have dramatic and immediate effects on the Budgets of the various States. For instance, if it were proposed to reduce by 5 per cent the financial assistance grants to the States, the State of Queensland, for instance, would lose $147m as a result of something which does not sound much—

         This is evident as a result of an investigation undertaken by the Queensland Treasury, and it was announced by the Queensland Treasurer on 11 November. He went on to talk about the proposed cuts of $25m from the Commonwealth State Housing Agreement, $20m from urban transport initiatives, and nearly $50m with the scrapping of the building better cities program. As a whole, the proposals would impact on Queensland to the tune of $422m a year. This would result in a hole in the Queensland Budget brought about quite deliberately by a Commonwealth government that would pursue those policies; it would be a hole which would then have to be made up by the Queensland Government in the form of reduced services, increased taxation or some other measure.

         If you listen to the merchants of doom on the Opposition side, you would think that the only currency affected by the present volatility was the Australian dollar. But if you look at the English pound, you will see that it has fallen dramatically and precipitously against the Australian dollar in recent weeks. There is no doubt that the sudden and dramatic fall has affected some 110,000 British pensioners who have their British pensions topped up by the Australian pension. The free fall of the English pound in recent weeks has outstripped the mechanisms of the social security legislation which are required to deal with these matters.

         At the moment we set that exchange rate four times a year and each setting remains in place for three months. There is a trigger mechanism designed to provide for sudden and dramatic changes in exchange rates, but it proved inadequate in the last weeks of October in coping with the volatility of the pound sterling. The present departmental rate is one Australian dollar to 39.14 pence. Yet we have had an average variation away from that of some 11 per cent in recent weeks. Anyhow, it does not reflect the trend movement in the pound sterling.

This has been based on the average of the Commonwealth Bank rate during the last two weeks of October. We will bring that in next week from 19 November. If we had not done that there would have been no change until mid-December and that would have badly and unfairly affected a large number of people living in Australia but with some English pension entitlement.

         The unemployment numbers that were released today for the month of October are nothing short of a national disaster. They are a tragedy for thousands and thousands of average Australian families. Indeed, something like 52,000 more people were added to the dole queues in that month alone, which brings the total since this recession began in late 1989 to half a million people. Five hundred thousand people, or thereabouts, have been added to the unemployment queues since this recession began—the recession that this man said we had to have.

        <para first-indent="16">

          Perhaps most disturbing, when we look at the composition of some of those numbers, is that 375,000 Australians have now spent more than 12 months on the dole. I have seen predictions in recent days to suggest that the number of long term unemployed will rocket towards 500,000 people by the middle of this decade under the sorts of policies we have seen in recent days. This is real pain and real hardship knowingly, willingly and deliberately inflicted on the people of Australia by this man, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), in the pursuit of his own short term, politically expedient objectives.

          I think what is most disturbing is that when we look at some of the regional characteristics of this unemployment experience we see the magnitude of the problem that is there for large parts of average Australia. For example, if we take the area of Fairfield and Liverpool in New South Wales and look at the average unemployment rate for the three months to September—not including the October deterioration—we see that the unemployment rate is now 18.6 per cent. In Richmond-Tweed on the mid-north coast of New South Wales, for example, it is 15.8 per cent. In north-western Melbourne there is an unemployment rate of 17.4 per cent, and an unemployment rate for young people in that area of 50.5 per cent. One in two young people in north-western Melbourne is unemployed. In fact, in outer western Melbourne the youth unemployment rate is 56 per cent. To take one final example, across in western Adelaide the unemployment rate is 14 1/2 per cent. In south Adelaide the youth unemployment rate is the national record of 56.9 per cent according to the data that has been released.

          A large part of the recession in the early 1980s was brought about by the drought, not by deliberate government policy, as was the case under the stewardship of this man. We had some of the leading shadow Ministers at the time, now government Ministers, describing those circumstances as a depression. Back in November 1983, the current Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) described the circumstances at the time as the `devastating depression in which we found this economy'. At a time when the unemployment rate was 9.7 per cent, significantly less than 11.3 per cent, he was describing it as a devastating depression.

But the prize for ultimate hypocrisy is always taken by our Prime Minister. In 1985, he described the circumstances in 1982 in the following terms: `In 1982 the economy was in a state of depression. It was at the bottom of the worst depression since the Great Depression'. Our current Prime Minister, in 1985, looking back at a time when the unemployment rate was 9.4 per cent, said it was the worst depression since the Great Depression. And he had the hide to get up here in this Parliament today and try to suggest that our measured remarks about the danger of this economy drifting towards depression were treacherous.

          Government members are always struggling for a definition of depression. The Treasurer got up and tried to explain how things had changed between 1982 and now. He said he could actually call it a depression then, and when things are dramatically worse now in terms of unemployment and debt or anything else he does not have to use the word. It is probably instructive to quote one of the Government's own definitions of depression. The Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown) used to be an economics teacher, and he has written a series of economics books. He is actually the man who is responsible for the One Nation failure, perhaps more directly than anybody else. When you take out R.J. Brown's

         The Government is damned out of the mouth of its own economic guru.

          What better description can you get of the circumstances today? In fact, it is probably worse today than even that definition because of the magnitude of the debt problem that was not possibly contemplated 10 or 15 years ago in this country. No-one had any idea that a Government could be so irresponsible and so out of control that it could boost debt from about $25 billion to about $150 billion net and about $180 billion gross in the pursuit of short term, politically expedient objectives. Probably to average Australians the greatest disappointment of all is that they see that the Prime Minister has no understanding of what they have to endure as a result of his policies. How long has it been since the Prime Minister actually went out and spoke to a group of unemployed people and listened to the pain and hardship of these people?

          I personally experienced one such case this week—the case of a migrant couple who had worked for 20 years to save for a house. Every time we have seen them over the last few months they have been enthusiastic at the prospect of finally getting their own home. At the end of last week the husband lost his job. They are devastated. They had just taken possession of the house. They had just locked themselves into the mortgage. The pain and hardship of that decision and to watch those people in tears is a staggering experience.

We say we should keep them on and carry them along in society until we can retrain them and get them back to work. You say that just giving is the compassion which suffocates. You say that giving people choice is the compassion that liberates; in other words, `Throw them out after nine months on unemployment benefits; knock off the support for taxpayers with children by the family allowance supplement; and ask the parents of kids from low income families to pay full fees in universities and elsewhere'. That is the sort of choice which you say is the compassion which liberates. We know it is a pernicious choice that will only damage them and limit their opportunities in society.

          Then the Leader of the Opposition half made the nasty point about unemployment amongst young people in inner Melbourne being 56 per cent when, in fact, the proportion of unemployed young people amongst the age group 15 to 19 is 14 per cent, not 56 per cent. The figure for those looking for work is 56 per cent, but it is 14 per cent for the kids aged 15 to 19. What does the Opposition want to do with kids aged 15 to 19—break their heart and their spirit by telling them that they have no prospect of a job, when only 14 per cent of the group is unemployed? This heartless Opposition not only has no head, it also has no heart. It regards compassion as suffocating. It basically regards the policies of the fittest as the way forward.

Secondly, Access Economics said, `When you look at the people who would like to work more, in addition to those who are actually unemployed, we do not have 11.3 per cent unemployed; we have about 20 per cent of our population underemployed'—not 11.3 per cent, but one in five Australians looking for work. Thirdly, yesterday the Department of Employment Education and Training, in commenting on future employment growth and in commenting on its leading indicator series, said, `Employment growth in the future is likely to be very sluggish'. Fourthly, in looking at those factors which lead you to that conclusion that Australia is drifting aimlessly towards a depression, let us look at the latest ANZ job advertisements. Basically, it was a 1.6 per cent figure lower than the previous month. Basically, that series is very flat.

A month or so after this Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) went out to the Australian people and said, `Spend, spend, spend', the latest retail trade figures came back with a fall. That is a critical factor in assessing where the economy is today, because it has been one of those aspects of the economy which the Government has been relying upon in its claims that we have today a recovery.

The latest National Australia Bank survey out on 4 November stated that the `economy remains locked in a pedestrian recovery with little prospect of any marked reduction in unemployment during 1992-93'.

These figures are thoroughly bad in every possible way. There is no saving grace. There are no excuses. I was very surprised by the Prime Minister today. When the first question was put to him about the gravity of Australia's unemployment figure, as released today, his first response was to find an excuse for it and to say that it was not as bad as it seemed.

The trend unemployment rate—that is the figure that the Treasurer has so much trouble with; honourable members may remember that we asked him a question a month ago and he got that wrong—is slowly rising, and today we have the very high figure of 11.1 per cent.

I do not say that it is like the 1930s depression; of course, it is not. But it is interesting to look at the unemployment rate in the 1930s. In 1930 it was 9.78 per cent. It then rose during the 1930s, to 10.98 per cent in 1936. In 1937 it was 8.83 per cent, in 1938 it was 7.46 per cent, and in 1939 it was 8.76 per cent.

          The Government's response to this originally was to deny the recession. When the recession was obvious even to the Government, it said it was a recession that we had to have. Within months of the Government saying that we were in a recession, it was claiming that we were in a recovery. The Government has been saying for about two years that we are now in a recovery. We had the incredible claim again today, effectively repeated by the Prime Minister, that the recession was over long ago. I think that is a sick, arrogant claim to make when we have the highest unemployment since the Great Depression.

In Victoria, the first major policy that Jeff Kennett announced was a complete reform of industrial relations.

He has released the one of 23 July but he has failed to release the minute of 6 July, for which he ought to be damned. It is yet another cover-up.

In his doorstop interview he talked about a depression and in his statement he talked about a depression—all of which had emerged within minutes of the ABS data being made available to the Opposition.

          So this is what those opposite call weighty consideration as to whether or not they should use this word `depression'. You can imagine the Deputy Leader of the Opposition flicking through the

          The Deputy Leader of the Opposition and his Leader made the very great error of comparing the current circumstance with that in 1982 and trying to say that, because some expressions might have been used to refer to that as a depression, that somehow justifies their making these remarks now. As I said before, a depression and a recession are actually technical terms—something which the honourable member for Flinders, even with his

          In the September quarter of 1982 we saw the economy contract by one per cent, and in the December quarter we saw it contract again by 0.6 per cent. Yet what have we seen in the June quarter this year? We have actually seen an expansion of a little over half a per cent and, indeed, we have had something like three-quarters of the economy expanding—although not rapidly and not as rapidly as we would like. But it is a total contradiction of the idea of a depression.

          Whereas in 1982 we had successive quarters of negative growth, here we have had successive quarters of positive growth. Yet we see the Leader of the Opposition and his pathetic Deputy saying that somehow this is evidence that Australia is drifting into depression. It just demonstrates either how they have totally lost the plot in terms of what is happening to the economy or, alternatively, how they will do anything and say anything in order to make a fairly cheap point.

          But at whose expense are these points being made? Is this description of the economy something which is likely to hurt us, the Government—us as individuals—or is it more likely calculated to hurt the economy, to depress confidence and in fact hold back the recovery which is under way in Australia? The recurring theme in Liberal Party politics and attitudes over the last 10 years has been to wait for the circumstances in which the economy would be in that condition which would justify the election of a Liberal government. We heard it from the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) in his wonderful remark: `The times will suit me'. Now we see it recurring. The Leader of the Opposition is simply returning to that theme which suggests that things are so bad that only a change of government can fix the problem.

          If the Opposition had just one responsibility today in moving its censure against the Government on this question it was to put forward a policy for dealing with the issue which it had identified—high unemployment. That was the issue those opposite had to confront today if anyone was to take them seriously in this debate. On that point they both failed comprehensively. They failed to substantiate the claim that they had any answer to these questions. I repeat: the fact that they would make the distinction between now and 10 years ago is simply to underscore the fact that 10 years ago they were bereft of policy and it required a Labor government to come in and deal with the simultaneous questions of unemployment and high inflation.

          Once again, we find the Liberal Party and its National Party of Australia colleagues totally bereft and at sea in terms of the policy issue. As the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) said, because of this absence of policy—the absence of an ability to address these questions—those opposite have essentially disqualified themselves from this debate. Only those who are prepared to talk about approaches which will help the problem rather than exacerbate it are qualified to talk in this debate.

          I do not want to contend with this issue simply on the basis of some political argy-bargy across the table; this is far too serious an issue to deal with in that way. There are 900,000-plus people out there looking for work and this has been the consuming concern of this Government for as long as that has been the circumstance in Australia. That is why we have spent our every waking moment trying to find ways of dealing with this question in circumstances where the world economy is sluggish and where we know there are limits to the extent to which Australia can act independently in order to spur the economy. But we have taken that action which we thought was responsible, the action which we thought we could take independently and responsibly, in order to deal with Australian circumstances.

          That is why we have acted on about a dozen occasions to reduce interest rates in order to provide a monetary policy setting conducive to expansion in Australia. That is why we, ahead of the rest of the world, decided that engaging in some fiscal stimulus was an appropriate policy mechanism to use in Australia's circumstances. Yet what is the curious thing about this? Indeed, the fatuous thing about this is that on every one of those occasions when this Government acted to provide some boost to the Australian economy what was the response of the Opposition?

          Its response was to oppose it. It opposed every reduction in interest rates; it opposed our actions on a couple of occasions to expand the economy through the Budget sector. Now we find the conclusive evidence that the action that we took in February, and again in the Budget, is in fact the policy prescription which is now being condoned, ratified and encouraged by the OECD. The OECD has said as a result of a meeting of its economic policy committee that countries of the developed world need to employ some stimulus through their budgets in order to provide some encouragement for the otherwise disappointing level of world economic growth.

          This was precisely the assessment that we made when we decided to take those actions in February and again in the Budget.

It has either opposed them or ridiculed them as being inappropriate for Australia's circumstances. Not only do those opposite have us to argue with, but they have the collective wisdom of the economists of the developed world, as represented by the OECD, who are not only condoning what we have done but are actually encouraging other members of the developed world to follow our lead. They say that one or two countries acting in isolation are not enough to encourage the world economy. We need other members of the developed world to engage in that policy prescription as well.

          I might say—and this is an important point—that not all countries had the kind of flexibility and the room to move as we did. So many other countries failed to take the opportunity that we took in the late 1980s to repair our Budget position, to return our Budget to surplus during the good times so that on this occasion we had the capacity to expand our fiscal activity in order to provide a stimulus necessary for moving the economy along.

          Yet, far from having policies which might help, the Opposition simply trots out again and again these policy prescriptions which it has dredged up from the early 1980s and the late 1970s, pretending that in some way they have some relevance to Australia's contemporary position. Those opposite do not seem to realise that the rest of the world has totally passed them by. Even that small number of countries which actually followed Thatcher—Thatcher and her very few acolytes—have abandoned those policies.

Even her own party has abandoned those policies.

But, you clots, you cannot see what your Leader is trying to do to you. You cannot see what your Leader is trying to do to Australia.

I mentioned before that the Leader of the Opposition is on record as saying that he will give no promises on unemployment and that there will be transitional effects leading to higher unemployment. Yet he has the nerve and the cheek to come in here and to dare to condemn and to attempt to censure this Government, which has done so much to repair the circumstances which we inherited and to set Australia up for a prosperous future. He could not even begin to imagine the way in which to achieve it.

          . Under the Public Accounts Committee Act 1951, the Committee is required to examine all reports of the Auditor-General, including reports of efficiency audits. In report No. 320 the Committee examined six reports of the Auditor-General, covering two efficiency audits and four project performance audits. These were tabled between May 1990 and April 1991.

          These Auditor-General's reports cover a variety of programs and departments, including the Department of Defence, the  Department of Veterans' Affairs, the Department of Social Security, the Attorney-General's Department and the Department of Administrative Services. Responses by departments to the audit reports and recommendations were encouraging, with most of the recommendations being accepted by the auditees.

          However the Committee, in its review of projects in all the departments considered in this report, observed common problems with information technology projects. The management, control and coordination of projects were areas in which all departments had encountered difficulties. These included inadequate prior planning, failure to monitor changes in cost-benefit ratios, loss of sight of the original objectives of projects, failure to undertake post implementation review, inadequate training of staff and using new IT systems, and failure to prepare adequate system documentation and user manuals.

          The Committee also draws attention to specific failings by the Department of Defence in its implementation of an appropriate information system for monitoring maintenance and utilisation of aircraft and some other equipment. The Committee makes recommendations in the report addressing these issues. The most important focus of report No. 320 of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts, which reviews six of the Auditor-General performance audits, is on increasing the accountability of Government agencies to the Parliament. I commend the report to the House.

         —The Trade Practices Legislation Amendment Bill amends the Trade Practices Act in three significant respects: in respect of the merger test; in respect of unconscionable conduct; and in respect of penalties. The three proposals can be variously described as good, bad and ugly. No section of the Trade Practices Act has provided more controversy than section 50, which deals with mergers and acquisitions. At present, the Trade Practices Act prevents a corporation from buying another company, merging or acquiring its assets if that would lead to market dominance. The original test which was inserted in the Trade Practices Act in 1974 prohibited mergers or acquisitions where they would lead to a substantial lessening of competition.

         In 1977 the section was amended to reflect the philosophy that there should be no legislative or administrative impediment to attainment by Australian industry of efficiency and international competitiveness. That change was introduced by the then coalition Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard). The Minister, in his second reading speech, said:

        In 1984 the Labor Government produced a Green Paper floating the possibility of returning to the pre-1977 merger test. It found no favour for that proposal in any responsible quarter. When section 50 was amended in 1986 by the then Labor Government under Attorney-General Bowen, the Government did not change the dominance threshold. Lionel Bowen reaffirmed the Government's support for the dominance test and said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The Government is firmly committed to the encouragement of efficient Australian industry and to increasing our competitiveness on world markets. It has been decided that the existing dominance test in section 50 should remain essentially unchanged. The coverage of section 50 will not be extended beyond those mergers which would result in undue concentration in a market.

        But the ink had hardly dried before Senator Tate, the then Acting Attorney-General, requested a House of Representatives legal and constitutional affairs committee to take another look. That inquiry, which was chaired by the current Minister for Tourism and Minister for Resources (Mr Griffiths), reported in May of 1989. It supported the retention of the current dominance test and noted that there was insufficient justification to recommend any amendments to the dominance test. In relation to returning to a substantial lessening of competition test, it also had this to say:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        It is widely accepted that this test would involve a significant lowering of the threshold, thereby subjecting a wider range of mergers to TPC scrutiny. This proposal would, therefore, have significant resource implications for the TPC. It would also reduce the level of harmonisation of Australian and New Zealand merger law. In addition, a return to the pre-1977 test would involve increased uncertainty for business, and may, therefore, impede decision making processes.
       </para>
       <para>
        That statement, which was made by the current Minister for Tourism and Minister for Resources, is as true today as it was when he made it. In looking at the possible change of the merger test as part of that inquiry, the Trade Practices Commission was among those who argued against changing the test. The Griffiths committee summarised the view of the Trade Practices Commission as follows:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The TPC believes that the test is likely to inhibit desirable industry rationalisation and may create more uncertainty for business. A significant widening of the threshold may, it argued, result in pressure to return to formal clearances, which delay the merger process. The TPC also put forward the view that the test of substantial lessening of competition is not a certain instrument, as there is not a strong body of law associated with it.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government supported the findings of the Griffiths committee. In August 1991, in a good statement on the Committee's report by the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy)—he was still good on this issue in August of 1991, still thinking clearly about it, before his judgment was clouded by lobbying that he was unable to stand up to and unable to intellectually match—he said:

       </para>
       <para>
        That was in August 1991. But in the meantime, a Senate committee had been set up to look into the matter. That Senate committee was chaired by Senator Cooney. After it looked at the matter, that Senate committee came to the conclusion that the test ought to be changed and recommended a shopping list of factors to be taken into account to determine when companies could buy the assets or merge with other corporations.

         What had changed between the holding of the Griffiths committee and the report of the Cooney committee was the view of the Trade Practices Commission or, rather to be more precise, what had changed was the Chairman of the Trade Practices Commission. Professor Fels, as the new Chairman of the Trade Practices Commission, proved an indefatigable lobbyist, going around to the Senate committee, going around to the print media inquiry, going around to the Minister, going around to other Ministers, going around to the Opposition, lobbying for a wider test which, incidentally, would increase the jurisdiction of the Trade Practices Commission to have a hand in determining the circumstances in which companies could buy assets or shares of other companies and also, incidentally, in determining the circumstances in which companies could sell and shareholders could sell shares or assets to others.

         Apart from the indefatigable work of Professor Fels, who proved a great Sir Humphrey Appleby to the Attorney-General's Jim Hacker and who managed to completely turn his own Minister on this particular question, the other development that seemed to carry some time with the Cooney committee was the work of Harvard Professor Michael Porter on the subject in a book entitled

It did not deal with the type of legislation which would be needed to bring about strong domestic competition and it has nowhere been shown that it was apposite or relevant to Australian conditions. Warren Pengilley, a former Trade Practices Commissioner, remarked:

It is not just people such as former trade practices chairmen Professor Baxt, Bob McComas and others who have argued against taking this particular step. The proposal which is put by this Government in this Bill—a bad proposal—is opposed by the Business Council of Australia, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the MTIA, the Law Council and the Australian Society of Certified Practising Accountants. It was also opposed by the former Attorney-General, Mr Bowen, the Minister for Resources and Minister for Tourism, and the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins), who did not want a straight shift from dominance to substantially lessening competition. Up until recently, it was opposed by the present Attorney-General. It is, of course, opposed by the coalition.

         More nonsense has been spoken on this subject than on just about any other subject in the Trade Practices Act, and there has been less light shed upon it and clear analysis as to what the outcome of this will be. For example, of the shopping list of nine factors that are supposedly to be taken into account by the Trade Practices Commission, at least five of them are already taken into account under the existing dominance test. At least five of them are taken into account in applying the current test as laid down in cases such as the Ansett-Avis case and the most recent case of Australian Meat Holdings.

It is saying, `Change the test, but take into account nine factors'—five of which are already taken into account—`and see what comes out of it'. What makes that wrong is that it has taken at least a decade to get some certainty into what this test means in practice so that companies know when they can make offers for the purchase of shares and assets. Then the Government comes along, in its magesterial wisdom, and says, `That can all be thrown away; a new test can be imposed' and it throws into convulsion the accepted law. It will take perhaps another decade before business is in a position where it can ascertain in what circumstances it can, and in what circumstances it cannot, make offers.

         Section 50 is the only section of the Trade Practices Act that deals with market structure. The balance deals with market conduct. When we come to market conduct, we should always take a very strong line in favour of competitiveness. But structure and conduct are not the same thing. We can say that a certain kind of structure will inevitably lead to uncompetitive conduct and if we can say that it ought to be banned. But if we cannot say that a particular market structure inevitably leads to that kind of conduct, there is no reason why the Government should intervene in the market, impose this regulation and direct itself to market structure. It is not the structure that is the crime when it comes to competition, it is the conduct.

It is trade unions that so often inhibit competitiveness in modern Australian society. The proposal to change the merger test is a bad one.

         The second proposal in this particular amendment is in relation to unconscionable conduct. Currently, the Trade Practices Act says that, in consumer transactions where unconscionable conduct occurs, proceedings can be taken to prevent it. It lists various matters, such as inequality of bargaining power, that can be taken into account. A report into small business was conducted in the previous Parliament by the Minister for Small Business, Construction and Customs (Mr Beddall) which recommended extending that provision into all commercial contracts.

         I argued strongly and strenuously against that. I did not believe that there was a warrant to extend that new statutory cause of action across the whole gamut of commercial contracts: to allow new causes of action to be developed, to throw into the courts the rewriting of contracts and to allow judges to second guess commercial realities. As part of my argument against it, I noted that recent developments in the High Court and elsewhere were extending all the time the existing avenues by which inequitable dealing could be struck down. In cases such as Amadio and Blomley v. Ryan the doctrine of equity was developing new remedies. We ought to recognise those new remedies and allow the courts to develop them, as they have done.

         The good thing about it is that the Attorney-General changed his mind.

It recognises that the common law, as it applies from time to time, is developing these remedies;  these remedies which can be availed of regardless of whether or not we enact this section. But by enacting this section, they can be investigated by the Trade Practices Commission and one can effectively seek them under the Trade Practices Act. Whilst I vigorously opposed the Government's original proposal, I support this proposal. It is, as I said earlier, the good proposal. The good thing about this proposal is that the Minister reversed his original stand.

         We now come to the ugly provision of this particular Bill: the provision that says conduct which breaches part IV of the Trade Practices Act, conduct that is anti-competitive, will incur higher fines. This Bill will increase the fine for corporations to $10m—a fortyfold increase. I think the Parliament should say that we consider anti-competitive conduct seriously and a wide range of fines ought to be imposed against it. But a little piece of this Bill is utterly offensive.

         When the Government went through this Bill and increased the fines fortyfold to $10m, two sections were left out: two sections that just happen to be ones which can be applied against the anti-competitive conduct of trade unions. Sections 45D and 45E will be quarantined in this particular part from any increase in penalties. What that means is that for trade unions which offend against those provisions the penalty stays at $250,000, whereas for corporations that offend against the balance of that part the fines go to $10m. In other words, the Government wants a penalty for its friends in the trade union movement which is 40 times less than the penalty that applies to corporations which breach the balance of that part.

         When it comes to applying penalties, there is one principle of the law: equal penalties for offences against a statute, regardless of the identity of the offender. That is what equality of the law is all about: equal penalties, equal treatment. But the Attorney-General cannot bring himself to do it. By reason of the fact that the trade union movement has such a hold over his Government, he cannot treat the trade union movement equally by subjecting it to equal penalties. An Attorney-General who cannot treat offenders against the law in an equal way is somebody who does not warrant being an Attorney-General. He has taken an absolutely shameful position. It is Labor's special rates for its special mates.

         The justification is even worse: the Attorney-General says, `Nobody has enforced the law, therefore we don't need to increase the penalties'. Where does that argument lead us?  Nobody enforced the laws against the corporate high-fliers. Does that mean we should not increase penalties against that kind of conduct? Is that what it means? The Attorney-General has not sought to enforce the law because he has run dead. He has now taken the position that he does not need to increase the penalties. First of all the Attorney-General goes to sleep and then he entrenches a special privilege in the statute in favour of those constituent organisations that nourish and nurture him and then ask of him special treatment and special favours when he comes to exercise the duties of a Minister of the Crown.

He would have made sure that he had equal treatment for them and he would have taken the position that he knows is right. But for the guillotine, I would have moved the amendment circulated in my name, which will have the effect of making equal penalties under part IV apply to trade unions as much as to anybody else.

         —The amendments proposed in the Health and Community Services Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 3) in respect of nursing homes will give effect to some of the aged care measures announced in the 1992-93 Budget.

         Amendments to the Aged or Disabled Persons Care Act allow for the introduction of sanctions against hostels which fail to comply with standards of care and quality of life for residents. The amendments also provide for the establishment of hospital standards review panels. These amendments bring procedures for hostels into line with those for nursing homes, whereby the Commonwealth can take action if nursing home owners are not providing residents with the quality of life and care required by gazetted standards.

         The amendments allow the Government to suspend payment, in respect of new residents, to a hostel not complying with the standards. The amendments also provide a peer review mechanism, called hostel standards review panels, for hostel operators who want a review of an assessment of the hostel's standards. If these panels recommend to the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe) that a declaration of failure to comply is appropriate, they may also recommend that the Commonwealth suspend the payment of financial assistance to the hostel for new residents. A similar sanction has been available in parallel circumstances for nursing home operators since 1991. During that time, the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services has taken this course of action against 12 nursing homes. The Opposition, however, on examining the details of these amendments, does not propose to oppose them.

         The Bill also seeks to amend the National Health Act in order to implement funding announced in the Budget to upgrade nursing homes. The Opposition is pleased to see this funding, however we note that the funding is limited and not all nursing homes seeking upgrading funding are likely to receive it. Many nursing home proprietors, while aiming to provide good quality care, have difficulty in meeting the Government's outcome standards, or health and fire safety standards, because they are operating in old or unsuitable buildings. This amendment will enable nursing home proprietors to apply for funds for upgrading work which has been identified as necessary for the well-being of their residents but which they might not otherwise be able to afford.

Advisers will be appointed for a specific period, and their services will be paid for by the proprietor. If the owner were unwilling to accept and pay for an adviser, the normal sanctions process would continue, including closing the home if that became necessary.

         There are very few of these organisations.

         I would also like to point out an anomaly which involves the National Health Amendment Bill passed in this House yesterday. Clause 4 of the National Health Amendment Bill repeals section 42A of the National Health Act. However, clause 16 of today's Bill amends section 42A of the National Health Act. Perhaps the experts can explain to us this rather interesting conundrum.

         I turn now to medical fees under a coalition government. The Government has been scaremongering by saying that medical fees will increase under a coalition government. This is completely incorrect and certainly worries people living in accommodation of this nature. Under the coalition the level of fees for a visit to the doctor will remain unchanged. The main difference is that the coalition recognises that some doctors charge in excess of the medical benefits schedule fee and we will allow patients to insure for these fees. The Labor Government forces patients to pay these additional costs out of their own pocket. Thus visits to the doctor or visits by the doctor to the patient—which is more or less the case in these circumstances—and visits by the patient to a specialist will mean that patients may be thousands of dollars out of pocket. Last year Australians paid $660m for medical expenses out of their own pockets. That is well beyond the capacity of the Medicare system to compensate.

         The coalition also addressed the enormous problems of waiting lists. We will reduce waiting lists by offering subsidies of up to $800 per couple per annum to those who purchase private health insurance. This will enable patients to use private hospital facilities and therefore better utilise the excess facilities which have been part of the system for far too long. These rebates will be targeted to pensioners and low income groups in particular. With regard to aged care, nursing homes and hostels, we favour more flexible funding and less overt regulation. There is too much regulation at the moment. The coalition is currently reviewing the situation and, unlike the Government, we are listening to all the organisations that wish to formulate a position.

What I take issue with is the claim that the Government is not listening. I had the pleasure of having the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services (Mr Staples) in my electorate a couple of weeks ago. I arranged a meeting between him and the directors and senior supervisory personnel of all the nursing homes and hostels in my electorate. Through that process we canvassed a number of issues.

         It is also important to note that this Bill has been developed with great consultation with the industry. This is not a Bill which has been developed in secret by the Department or by the Minister. This Bill is the result of extensive consultation and discussion. On the question of excessive paperwork requirements, we believe that there has been an overreaction by some sectors of the industry in their completion of paperwork and that excessive demands have been placed on nursing personnel in some homes and hostels. The Minister has undertaken to outline new guidelines to the nursing home sector which will explain clearly what paperwork is required. This is an attempt to diminish the current high levels of demand that are being placed on some people working in that industry.

         Because I am very familiar with the nursing homes in my own electorate, I recognise that the vast majority of people working in nursing homes have great compassion, provide great quality of care, and are determined to try to provide good aged care for all of their residents. They are concerned that their No. one priority, the provision of quality of care, is maintained and is not overwhelmed with excessive paperwork. The Minister is listening to all the people in the industry, and to the pleas of the nurses and other staff in homes and hostels. He is acting to take note of their concerns and to reduce that demand.

There is a balance that we need to maintain between the provision of high quality care and accountability for government expenditure. The Federal Government expends over $1.6 billion a year in the provision of aged care through nursing homes and hostels in this country, and that is a lot of money. Through the provision of that care we have increased and improved the quality of care in the last five years through the reforms that we have undertaken in the aged care sector. The Government is accountable to the taxpayers, the people of this country, and must ensure that those moneys are being expended properly, fairly and reasonably.

         The paperwork that is required of nursing staff in aged care is to ensure that there is equity in the provision of facilities and services to aged people. That is why there is a need for people to fulfil some of the requirements of documentation. All people in the industry recognise that the reforms that this Government has undertaken in the aged care sector have dramatically improved the provision of quality care. Issues such as residents' agreements, the classification of different levels of care required for different frailties, and the fact that we have moved to vastly improve the quality of accommodation in aged care and in nursing homes, are all major improvements that the industry recognises are important and welcome. That is why the Bill that we are discussing today, which involves an extension of those requirements from nursing homes into the hostel sector, is welcomed, and I am sure it is welcomed by all members of the House.

         I am pleased to be able to speak in support of the Bill because it does contain initiatives which will continue to maintain the viability and quality of the Australian hostel and nursing home industry. Older Australians who live in nursing homes are entitled to a high quality of life and care while they are in those homes. Commonwealth standards monitoring teams have been given the task of visiting aged care facilities and monitoring their compliance with outcome standards. These outcome standards focus on the outcomes for residents, ensuring that their physical, social and emotional needs are met.

         This Bill seeks to amend the Aged or Disabled Persons Care Act to bring hostels into line with nursing homes in enabling the Government to take action against those aged care facilities which do not provide residents with the quality of life and care which frail aged members of the Australian community can properly expect. We are talking about a very small sector of the aged care industry. The vast majority of people working in this sector do provide top quality care with compassion and have a regard for the needs of their residents. But there are some in our sector, a small sector, who are not able to do that. We are trying to act positively in this Bill to ensure that they have the capacity to work towards improving the quality of their care.

         This legislation proposes to implement for hostels a system that has worked very well for nursing homes. Under the National Health Act, nursing homes that disagree with the findings of a standards monitoring team can seek a review. This review is carried out by a standards review panel which includes members of the industry. If a panel recommends to the Minister that a declaration of failure to comply is appropriate, it may also recommend that the Commonwealth suspend the payment of financial assistance to the home for new residents. The proposed amendments to the Aged or Disabled Persons Care Act will ensure that there will now also be available a similar peer review mechanism for a hostel operator who seeks review of the assessment of the hostel's compliance with standards.

         As with nursing homes, if the panel recommends to the Minister that a declaration of failure to comply is appropriate, it may also recommend that the payment of financial assistance to the hostel for new residents be suspended. To date, it has been necessary to take this action against only 12 nursing homes, which is a very small number of nursing homes when we take into account the total number throughout Australia. These amendments will enable similar action to be taken against those few hostel operators who provide substandard care for their residents. We are acting very positively in that we are also implementing a recent Budget initiative involving funding to upgrade nursing homes.

         The religious and charitable sector has, since 1984, been able to apply for funding from the Commonwealth to upgrade its nursing homes. This Budget initiative extends that benefit to the private for profit sector of the nursing home industry. There is a considerable variation in the standard of accommodation across the broad spectrum of the nursing home industry. A clear and undeniable link exists between the quality of care a nursing home is able to provide and the calibre and characteristics of its premises. Despite their best endeavours, many nursing homes outside the religious and charitable sector are unable to provide a quality of care consistent with the high standards the Government has set because they are operating in old or unsuitable buildings. The inequality in the provision of care resulting from these variations in the physical condition of nursing homes conflicts with the Government's commitment to social justice.

         The Bill also contains one other measure which promotes the viability of the nursing home industry. It provides for the Secretary of the Department of Health, Housing and Community Services to direct that a nursing home adviser be appointed to a nursing home where the home has breached conditions of funding. The adviser will be someone from a list of approved by the Secretary and will usually have experience in the management of aged care facilities. This measure is aimed at giving nursing homes which would otherwise be closed the chance to improve their performance with the help of an adviser. This approach has already worked well in some cases on a voluntary basis. If the proprietor is unwilling to accept and pay for an adviser, then the Minister can proceed with sanctions against the home, which may include closing it down if that becomes necessary—but that would only be in the very extreme cases and as a last resort. Responsibility under the National Health Act for the management of the home will remain with the proprietor and no liability is incurred by the adviser.

         The Government is also amending the Health Insurance Act to prevent pathology practices from being disadvantaged if they choose to merge. Currently when two or more pathology practices merge the resulting approved pathology authority that emerges loses the right to temporary licence collection centres. Clearly, it is desirable that such a fundamental commercial activity as merging is not discouraged through a simple oversight in the original drafting of the legislation. Furthermore, the merging of approved pathology authorities reduces the industry's excess capacity. Such excess capacity has been known to provide an incentive to overservice. There are a number of important clauses in this Bill, and I recommend the Bill to the House.

         We are appalled on two grounds. The first is that we are required to debate this matter just eight days after the Bill was first published. The main Bill has 175 clauses over 72 pages, with four schedules—a further 30 pages—attached. It is quite complicated legislation. It is very important legislation. It affects the environment so it has very important conservation issues attached to it. But it is also of very direct interest to a wide range of industries because obviously it affects the use of land, the way in which various developments might be carried out and, indeed, the way whole industries are conducted particularly, for example, the forestry industry. So it is a matter of fundamental importance for the country, regardless of which point of view one comes from, and there are very many interested parties in relation to this legislation.

         I repeat what I have said on a number of occasions recently—that the House of Representatives is simply not doing its job. It is not examining legislation. It is an undemocratic chamber in the way it is being run at the moment. It is an absolute nonsense to suggest that people could have considered this matter properly over the last eight days. I had asked the various interest groups to give me their opinions on this, but hardly any of them have been able to do so within the time. I had to produce my recommendation to the shadow Cabinet over the weekend. The shadow Cabinet met on Monday and considered it, and then the joint party room considered it on Tuesday so that it could be debated this week. It is just not acceptable to have legislation of this importance treated in this way. I am sure that my colleagues dealing with the other 50 Bills that have been pushed through this chamber this week have the same view. There is a whole lot of important legislation in other areas which is receiving this scant attention by this House.

As we all know, a large number of people have been engaged in the ESD process—at very considerable expense to business and unions and at very considerable taxpayer expense because the conservation groups, naturally, were unable to fund their side of the equation.

         People have sat around tables, looked at things in depth and come up with balanced recommendations. What happened? Out of left field, this Minister produced an initial draft of a Bill a few weeks ago which had nothing to do with the ESD process. That draft Bill was not a matter of consultation. It was produced at a time when the ministerial council, the Australian and New Zealand Environment and Conservation Council, ANZECC, had already appointed a task force to look at the problems of the protection of endangered species. That task force is still drawing up a draft national strategy within which the governments that are party to that council were to draw up their respective pieces of legislation.

That task force was to report in March with its final recommendations.

She went right around the side of this, absolutely broke agreements with the States, ignored the commitment that she had made to the other Ministers to wait for the report of this task force on endangered species and came up with legislation which even her own ministerial colleagues found totally unacceptable.

When the consultation with the States was held, three States could not be there simply because they had not had sufficient notice, yet the Minister said that people had been consulted. The conservation groups were, allegedly, consulted at the same notice, and also the industry representatives. To call that a process of satisfactory consultation is a denial of the normal meaning of the word. That is really a totally unacceptable way of bringing these matters before the Parliament.

         This legislation was supposed to be part of a mosaic of legislation around the Commonwealth in accordance with a national strategy which ANZECC was preparing through its appointed task force. As to the reactions of various people to this legislation so far, the point is that they simply cannot form a detailed reaction in such a short time. Once again, it will be up to a grossly overburdened Senate to examine this legislation and give it proper democratic consideration. Our support for the legislation at this stage is conditional on the various submissions that will be made to us from conservation groups, from unions, from industry, from anybody who has an interest in the matter, and between the time that we are looking at it now and the time it is considered in the Senate.

I can tell the Minister that at this moment she has offended just about everybody. The conservation groups were promised legislation on endangered species before the 1990 election. They feel cheated because it has taken so long to come along and it is not in line with what they were promised before the election. That has happened with just about every conservation issue. The Government, before the last election, promised the earth and the moon and the stars to the conservation groups. It had no possibility of meeting those commitments; they were undeliverable.

         A very important area of the legislation is that of the placing of conservation orders. These are of three kinds: interim, permanent or impact assessment. We note that the previously unfettered right of the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories to take various decisions unaided by colleagues has been watered down, obviously, by the intervention of other Ministers. There are restrictions on what the Minister can do in putting an interim conservation order on a particular activity in order to protect a species that might be threatened pending suitable investigation.

         Then there are permanent conservation orders which can be made on Commonwealth lands and waters by the environment Minister on the same grounds as the interim conservation orders. Although the Minister says in her second reading speech that these will be made only with the approval of Cabinet, as will extensions of interim conservation orders, the legislation does not prescribe this. So we have only the support of the second reading speech for the requirement for the Minister to consult with the Cabinet and get Cabinet agreement to a permanent conservation order. That is not as strong a basis as we would like. It is a much weaker form of restraint on the Minister. It relies on the Acts Interpretation Act and a court presumably looking at the second reading speech and giving that a certain weight, but it certainly does not have the same weight as a section in the Act which would require the Minister to take a matter to Cabinet and go through the Executive Council. So that is one of the questions we would want to raise between now and the actual debate that will occur on this Bill in the Senate.

The shadow Minister for sustainable development and the environment, the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Carlton), spent all of his time bleating about the process here, and mentioned very little of the detail of the Bill. I suspect that, because of his late arrival into this portfolio area, he does not yet have a complete grasp of the significance of the Endangered Species Protection Bill. This Bill is perfectly consistent with the entire debate about ecologically sustainable development and in fact is couched in terms of the key principles of ESD. Those key principles of ecologically sustainable development are: firstly, that there should be inter-generation equity—that is, that the current generation should not leave an impoverished environment for the next; secondly, that there should be maintenance and protection of biodiversity; and, thirdly, that we should deal cautiously with irreversibility.

So we have certainly known of the existence and the idea of endangered species legislation, and we have been working with members of the Caucus, the Minister, conservation groups and anyone else who wanted to knock on our door for those two or 2 1/2 years.

         There are five key elements to the Bill. For the first time there will be a scientifically based listing process. This means that politicians will not be debating and deciding which species are endangered; rather, scientists will decide for us which species should be on the Commonwealth's endangered species list. We must keep in mind, of course, the fact that State governments already have a list themselves. We hope over time that the lists will merge.

         The first step is to have an agreed list of species which are in danger and which need to be saved. The second step, and this is the best part of the legislation, is that we seek to go out and recover—that is, save—the species. The most controversial part of this legislation, and any such legislation dealing with the environment, is always that part where a government, in this case the Commonwealth, says that an activity must be stopped in order to save a threatened species. I reckon that more species will be saved by means of the recovery plans than will ever be saved by the imposition of the permanent conservation orders that are written into this Bill. By that I mean that, whilst from time to time there may be a headline which says that an environment Minister or Commonwealth government stops a particular activity—a mine or a farm or whatever—in order to save a species, that will be a one in 10 year event.

I want those opposite to understand that the event that will take place day after day through the Commonwealth working with State governments—and I will give an example in a minute—will be the drawing up of plans first of all to discover the existence and population of a particular species and then the identification of the threats to the species. Very detailed plans will then be put into effect to ensure that there is no further danger to a particular species and there is a means by which the population of that species can be built up in a given area.

         Further to that we have what are called threat abatement plans. These are a broader categorisation of threats to any number of endangered species.

So we need some thoroughgoing abatement plans to make sure that a dieback fungus is stopped in a region, that foxes are wiped out in a region, or that any other form of feral animal is wiped out. There is a specific focus on recovery plans species by species, but where we can identify more general threats to a number of species, such as feral animals, we will also draw up what we call abatement plans in order to wipe out the threat to a number of endangered species.

One particular recovery plan which has already been drawn up, which is an example of what I regard as the most important part of the legislation, is the plan for the northern hairy-nosed wombat. As far as we know, going back about 150 years, it roamed across a considerable area throughout Queensland and New South Wales. It is now found in only a very small area of Queensland, Epping Forest National Park, which is an open woodland and semi-arid area.

Sometimes those other animals may be introduced; in this case, the kangaroo is the main competitor for feed. I would like to give honourable members a hint of the sort of detail required and some of the costs that will arise because of these recovery plans. We will not be just setting in place a plan and then walking away from it; what we will have to be doing, of course, is constantly monitoring and keeping ourselves up to date in order that we save a particular species.

         Details such as these have to be considered: the conservation measures that are being used in this case—the Commonwealth has already given a great deal of money to the Queensland National Parks and Wildlife Service under our endangered species program which, of course, has been running for some time; the availability of on-site accommodation for staff and researchers; the continued exclusion of cattle and public visitation; the maintenance of firebreaks along the perimeter of the park to reduce the potential for wildfire; six to eight weekly checks by the ranger in charge of fences, firebreaks and the population in general; six monthly monitoring of the animal's abundance using burrowing activity counts; six monthly monitoring of the density of kangaroos, with whom it competes for feed; a three monthly assessment of pasture biomass and grazing pressure; and three yearly trapping of wombats to assess breeding status, body condition and population composition.

         The Endangered Species Protection Bill is a result of the activity of the environmentalists and Green movement who supported the Government in the 1990 election and who are now coming home to demand implementation of their views. They were able to allocate some preferences and, as the Parliamentary Secretary at the table says, a lot of work has gone into this particular Bill. Some groups have been consulted, obviously, but a lot of other groups around Australia have not been consulted. Obviously, with the time schedule that Opposition members have had to look at this Bill, we have not been consulted at all.

         The State governments have had a dry run on this legislation. Those of us in Victoria and Tasmania are aware of endangered species legislation, so much so that farmers have been prevented from ploughing the silver tussock because that could become endangered.

         There was also a suggestion that the legless lizard might be lost; farmers all over the State of Victoria were greatly upset by the Kirner Government's suggestions for similar legislation. Likewise, in Tasmania, the former Labor Government brought forward legislation of a similar kind. So the Federal Government has plenty to go on in drafting this sort of legislation to, in the final analysis, prevent a project from proceeding and prevent farmers from farming their land in the traditional manner. We see also arrangements in terms of the forest industries, where the endangered species argument has been used to lock up the Tasmanian forests, the forests down here in the south-east of New South Wales.

         —And in East Gippsland, I am reminded. The tactic there, of course, is to use rare birds and koalas as a medium to attract public attention. By using that mechanism, foresters and environmentalists are persuaded that large tracts of forest land can be locked up. Obviously there is a public sympathy for koalas. By using that public sympathy, we can run the argument that eucalypt forests should be locked up because the koalas or some rare birds might become extinct.

         None of the rational arguments about the ravages of bushfires are ever taken into account. It is not taken into account that some of the forests might be ageing and should be cut down in the interests of environmental control so that new young trees can grow in their place and improve the environment. The same tactics are being employed in this Bill. So let honourable members be fully aware of what the environmentalists and the Greens have in mind. The two key issues are: what is an endangered species; and how will we enforce the regulations and the legislation? The Parliamentary Secretary admits that the complexity of the legislation is such that it would be fairly difficult to enforce.

         The honourable member for Braddon (Mr Miles) is well known in this House for his erudite views on matters affecting Tasmania and the locking up of Tasmanian forests, and he has seen what has happened with a Labor government in that State and the way in which it gradually encroached on public forests by locking them up so that the loggers could not have access on a long term basis. He has pointed out to me, and I point out to honourable members, the remarkable way in which this legislation has been drafted. I draw the attention of the House to the definition on page 4 of the Bill of the word `endangered'. There is quite a lot of supporting material on what we mean by `endangered', and that is fair enough. The word `habitat' is also fairly difficult to define.

         I will give some of the technical background to the species we have in Australia. Australia plays host to an estimated 18,000 species of vascular and 36,000 non-vascular plants, as well as 108,000 species of invertebrates. Since European settlement, the losses of species have not been large in terms of the total number, with about 780 species of birds and animals being lost. However, although it is true that 99 per cent of species that have existed throughout the world at some stage are no longer with us, I view the loss of any species as a serious matter.

         A recent study by the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources found that, contrary to popular belief, most extinctions of species in Australia were not the result of clearing of farmland, disease or over-hunting. Instead, changed ways of fire, introduced species such as foxes and the 18 million feral cats in Australia, along with introduced herbivores such as sheep and cattle, were the major factors contributing to mammalian extinctions. We can see that other factors are involved in keeping these species going. Of course, extinction is sometimes difficult to prove. A case in point is the Adelaide blue-tongue lizard recently found in the belly of a snake, despite the last reported sighting of that species being over 50 years ago.

The environment Minister said in October that industry groups were `bloody minded and obdurate'. That was her view of them and their quite legitimate opposition to what were then fairly draconian powers in the draft Bill. As the shadow Minister has indicated, if the original Bills had come before this House we would have had great difficulty in supporting their passage. The environment Minister said:

Obviously, we have precedents in other parts of the world of committees of this kind having extraordinary powers of control over major development projects.

The same Minister has spent $285,000, in conjunction with her colleagues, on sending Australian delegations to the June Earth Summit in Brazil which produced ecological agreements that made no mention of economic considerations.

We have a very genuine concern on this side of the House that, whilst this legislation purports to protect endangered species, it has a number of hidden agenda and unintended consequences that may have long term problems for particular projects in Australia. This legislation could be used to prevent those projects proceeding, because we have seen the way in which environmentalists operate—we have seen the way in which legislation such as this can be used, by using the fine print, to prevent major projects proceeding. The coalition agrees with the thrust of the legislation but shows great concern about the way in which the legislation has been drafted and presented to the House.

         There has been a long argument—or a long debate—within this House and within the Australian community about the need for the protection of endangered species legislation. I guess that that argument will continue. Certainly, the amendments moved by the Opposition in this House will ensure the continuation of that debate.

         A word that has been used in this debate is `biodiversity'. There is no doubt that the enactment of this endangered species legislation will go a long way towards ensuring that we maintain biodiversity. As has been indicated, I guess by speakers from both sides of the House, biodiversity is something which we are yet to cash in on. During the rush towards science and technology during the 1950s and 1960s and that great expanse of knowledge into the 1970s, there is no doubt that the embracing of science and technology did leave behind the role of more mundane things like simple species. Lots of those species are unattractive to us. Some of them are the cute and cuddly types, the ones that we can actually sell readily as souvenirs in the shop in Parliament House or anywhere else.

         Certainly, the role of science and technology did not embrace the use of species and the way in which they could portray and help society. We tended to overlook a simple thing like the fungus which contributed to the production of penicillin. It played a large role in saving many lives during the Second World War, and has certainly saved many lives since. That is just one of the spin-offs that we can get from a species which, in its original sense, we would not consider to be something which is worth while preserving.

         Certainly there are particular exceptions to this endangered species legislation such as pathogens. They will cause death, and it is desirable that we probably do eliminate those from the species list of the planet. But in the case of many of the species, we have yet to learn and appreciate some of the spin-offs that we can get from them, whether it be directly or from the extractions of chemicals. Certainly, that has been done in the past and can be done in the future.

Then, in March 1990, just before the last election, the Government made a commitment to consider endangered species legislation. All Commonwealth Government departments have had the drafting instructions for this legislation for over 12 months and in February 1992, over 1,000 copies of the discussion paper on the legislation were widely distributed.

         There were briefings of interest groups, both industry and conservation, in February and March 1992 and September and October 1992. These groups had the opportunity to see the draft Bill before the September briefing and a revised draft before the October briefing which, in itself, is an unusual procedure for Commonwealth legislation. As part of that consultation, the concept of endangered species legislation was raised in the draft

         The draft strategy's objectives for legislation were to encourage the introduction, in States, Territories and the Commonwealth, of legislation that would require parliamentary approval for an action or development that knowingly threatens a species with extinction. Forty-five comments were received on this objective. The Endangered Species Advisory Committee revised the strategy after considering comments and the revised strategy, published in 1992, recommended introduction of Commonwealth endangered species legislation.

         Within the Government, in October 1991 a Cabinet submission was circulated and interested departments were briefed. As well, the Caucus committee on ASET was briefed by the Minister's staff on 12 September, and again by the Minister on 10 October. On 28 October 1991, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) and the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories (Mrs Kelly) agreed that the legislation be drafted without first being given in principle Cabinet support, and that a Cabinet decision be taken in early 1992, when a draft Bill would be available for discussion.

         As a result, more than 150 representations were received, with the overwhelming majority from conservation organisations and individuals who supported the legislation. Nine were from industry organisations which, in general, expressed some reservations about the legislation and wanted to be consulted on the draft Bill. New South Wales opposed the legislation on the grounds that it followed the flawed Heritage Commission—as it called it—approach, and the Northern Territory objected to the legislation because it could delay some development approvals.

         In September-October 1992, Cabinet submissions and the Bill were circulated to Government departments. Copies of the Bill were provided to the main industry and conservation lobby groups on 18 September and to all States on 24 September. Further briefings of industry, conservation and State representatives were carried out on 28 September and 15 October, as well as further consultation with the Caucus committee on the environment, which was briefed on 8 October, and again on 13 October 1992. So, we have had these consultations which honourable members opposite feel we have not had.

         The consultations have resulted in considerable changes to the legislation. One change is the listing of ecological communities. Only endangered communities can go on to the list and the criteria for listing is to be spelt out by regulation, on the advice of the scientific sub-committee. There were various other changes, such as the listing of species and the listing of the key threatening processes. As well, Commonwealth actions and decisions affecting endangered species will now be considered under the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act, rather than the endangered species protection legislation. That is, no additional process will be involved. The ability of the environment Minister to issue conservation orders has been restricted to a period of up to six months for Commonwealth lands and waters and to the period of environmental assessment under the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act in the case of Commonwealth approval.

         This legislation covers many different types of animals, and I mentioned some of them in my introductory remarks. I realise that time is limited here. I restate my commitment and the Government's commitment to biodiversity in the sense that doing away with biodiversity is like having a library with just one book in it or 10,000 copies of the one book. I commend the legislation to the House.

         —It is unfortunate that this Endangered Species Protection Bill 1992 and the other cognate Bill, which is very important legislation, has a very short period for debate in this House. The honourable member for Richmond (Mr Newell), who spoke before me, has indicated to us there has been a tremendous amount of consultation going back to 1989. If this process started in 1989, why has it come into the House now for us to get only an hour's debate on it?  It is absolutely disgraceful.

         —Exactly. Where is the Minister for the Arts, Sport, the Environment and Territories (Mrs Kelly) during this debate?  The Government says that it has undertaken extensive consultation, but the draft legislation was cut about and the form in which it now comes into the House is almost unrecognisable. All the consultation with us was on the draft legislation, not on these Bills, and it has been changed dramatically. As the previous speaker for the Government indicated, these Bills are reticently supported by both sides of the House. That is a good indication that this legislation should have been given a lot more consideration. It is for that reason that in the Senate we would like to have much more extensive investigation of this type of legislation.

         I draw to the attention of the House the fact that this issue in Australia and this legislation is important mainly because over the last decade we have not been able to trust the Government with regard to environmental matters and the forest industries. It would be a different debate if the course of government with regard to these types of issues were predictable, if the Government had based its legislation completely on biological and scientific data and if it would stick by that form of legislation. But what we have seen over the years is environmental Dark Greens having an influence on this Government to the point where it does a U-turn.

         It worries me that the door is left a bit open in this legislation for real political pressure to be brought on. I go back to one particular definition, because time does not allow for anything else, which is the definition of `species'. I ask the Government:  why can we not have a scientific definition which stands and is recognised right around the world?  The Government has given that in the definition, but why does it then go on and add these words:
        </tab>

         This whole area needs to be based on scientific evidence. I am fully supportive of protecting endangered species and protecting the genetic make-up of the great biodiversity of the world. But I do not believe we should be bringing in legislation which leaves the way open for political pressure to be brought to bear on any particular Minister—Labor, Liberal, National Party or whatever. It should be able to stand on its own right in regard to the scientific data which determines what is a species and therefore what is in danger.

         In this Bill we see again this political manoeuvring by the Labor Government in regard to a most important area. There is no need for it. We need to put this in a very open, rational debate and let it be based on scientific evidence and not allow for this out by a government, as the definition of `species' does on page 4 of the Bill. It is quite unsatisfactory that, after years of debate in this area, we cannot bring legislation into this House which can stand on the evidence rather than being open to political pressure.

         —The Endangered Species Protection (Consequential Amendments) Bill 1992 covers much of the forest, mining and tourist industries in Australia. As I was saying before, the opportunity to debate this legislation is pretty important to Australia. These industries are vital for our economic success and therefore the Bill should be critically examined. This legislation covers all those areas in which the Commonwealth has some say and some control. The fishing industry comes into it as

         I return to those definitions which I was talking about earlier in my speech on the Endangered Species Protection Bill 1992, in particular the definition of `species' and also the definition of `habitat', where we say that we are interested in those species which may have been there but also in those which may be able to be reintroduced and re-established in a particular region. That definition opens up a vast range of options. It would be different if we were always dealing with rational people in regard to these matters, because I am certain that we could come to a balanced position between industry and people genuinely concerned about the environment and conservation.

         But in Australia over the last five or 10 years—and around the world for that matter—there have been some people, who are referred to as the Dark Greens or the radical Green element, who are totally uncompromising in this regard. For example, in regard to the forest and mining industries in Tasmania, their goal is to stop the forest industries in Tasmania. There is no doubt about that. The way in which this legislation is written provides them with ample opportunity to say, `Look, that particular species was actually living on the west coast of Tasmania. We have evidence of it in the records of 10,000 years ago. They don't live there now. They've now moved over to the east coast or to the north-west coast of the island, but they once did live there'. This provides an opportunity for that species to be reintroduced there because they have been endangered in some other area of the island.

Most people—if not every member of this Parliament—are interested in protecting endangered species so long as it is put on a fair and rational basis. The definitions in this Bill should be based on scientific evidence and not be politically motivated and politically inspired.

         —The Opposition will not be opposing the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill. The Bill is intended to give effect to the announcement in the Budget to extend the export market development grants scheme beyond the eight-grant cut-off in order to assist Australian exporters in their efforts to penetrate new markets. That means that exporters can get eight grants and then the scheme is not available to them. The Government has sought to identify an area in which it can encourage exporters into new markets. The measures in the Bill will extend the current scheme in that respect. The amendment will provide limited access to the scheme after eight grants. Exporters applying for grants beyond eight will need to demonstrate initiatives in pursuing `new markets', as defined by the Bill—that is, a market which is new for the claimant—in relation to a particular export activity.

         New market access beyond eight years will be limited to exporters who have not achieved export earnings of more than $300,000 in respect of goods, services, industrial property rights or know-how in that new market. The threshold for a limited number of specified larger scale project service activities will be increased to $1m. Expenditure eligible for consideration in respect of a grant will be limited to that incurred developing the new market, rather than that incurred developing all markets. Exporters will have access to grants in regard to a new market for up to three years and there will be no limit on the number of new markets, so defined, in which an exporter may engage in order to give full potential to this facility to develop new export markets for Australia.

         The export market development grants scheme was established in 1974. Since then, there have been five reviews of the scheme and numerous amendments to the Export Market Development Grants Act to improve the operation and targeting of the scheme. At this moment, two separate reviews of the scheme are under way. Firstly, Austrade has engaged a consultant to investigate the efficiency of the scheme and answer the fundamental question of whether it has been successful in getting businesses to export. Secondly, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology has established a subcommittee to look at extending the scheme to cover inbound tourism activities, although the scheme had been extended to cover tourism activities in 1978 and the accommodation sector of the tourism industry in 1982. Nevertheless, inbound tourism activities are still ineligible for grant.

         These constant reviews and changes to the scheme do not really provide a stable and secure environment for exporters. Nevertheless, we are not intending to oppose this amendment to the scheme, because we see the scheme as important for exporters in the context of, firstly, the worst recession in 60 years, and, secondly, the abject failure of this Government to undertake far-reaching micro-economic reform, which would be of infinitely greater benefit to exporters.

         I put it to those people listening to the broadcast of this discussion on this small Bill to amend the export market development grants scheme: if you were to tune into parliamentary Question Time and, in the face of the worst recession in 60 years, listen to the arrogant creature who poses as Prime Minister of this country for the time being, you would hear him, day after day, seeking to exculpate the difficulties facing the Australian nation by blaming the Opposition. Underneath it all, one of the reasons for this is that he caused the difficulties and, consequently, cannot fix them. If those in the marketplace seeking to export have to rely on export market development grants, the reason is obvious: if this Government were to be returned, they would not receive the sort of real assistance that we will give when elected to government.

         I will cite three of the taxes that would go. I say to the people listening to this debate: imagine that you are exporting products or services at the moment, for which this could be applicable. Upon the election of the coalition, if you are an exporter facing intense competition to establish markets overseas you will no longer have to pay a wholesale sales tax; you will no longer have to pay payroll tax; and you will no longer have to pay a fuel excise. To use an old colloquialism: you are starting to cook with gas. You are in an infinitely better position than simply being given an export market development grant. Nevertheless, we will allow the scheme to run right through. The program will be completed. That is the contrast: the real removal of significant impediments to business seeking to compete not only with importers but also for markets overseas, with the removal of taxes that are imposed at present, provides a real opportunity to drive forward.

         It was only in the context of the failure of the Government to implement balanced macro-economic policy and undertake fundamental reforms in the micro-economy that the Hughes committee review of the EMDG scheme saw a need to continue the export incentive schemes—not only the EMDG scheme, but others as well. In 1982, during our period in government, the Industries Assistance Commission recommended that the scheme be extended for five years as an interim measure for a domestic economy hostile to exporters. Ten years later the domestic economic environment is still hostile to exporters. The latest change to the EMDG scheme is an indictment, in many ways, of the wasted opportunities and inaction of the Labor Government. It is in this context that the coalition did not oppose the extension of the export market development grants scheme to 1995 when that was done in 1990, and it is in that context that we do not oppose this amendment to the Act this evening.

         The coalition's Fightback package, with its abolition of six existing taxes and the introduction of a goods and services tax which zero rates exports, will reduce the cost to exporters by $1.7 billion.

Whilst there is a $1.7 billion reduction in costs for exporters by the abolition of those taxes, business overall will benefit from a cost reduction of $20 billion.

         The Business Council of Australia and the Industry Commission have said that the implementation of the policies advocated by the coalition could boost the gross domestic product of Australia by at least 15 per cent; in other words, the gross domestic product could permanently be increased by at least $60 billion. These are the reforms that we are putting to the Australian people and saying, `Unless we make this dramatic change we won't get the sort of lift that Australia requires, not only in our gross domestic product but also in a flow through to the living standards of all Australians'. Exporters, to which this measure is aimed, will judge the Government's failure at the next election on its ability to reduce costs by undertaking micro-economic reform. As I said earlier, this failure, together with the Government's crude use of monetary policy, has visited the worst recession in 60 years on the Australian people and there has been a cost to businesses and jobs.

         The fact is that this Government's record in the field of international trade is appalling. From time to time, when the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development (Mr Kerin) is given a guernsey in this country, and given an opportunity to say or do something—he no longer sits in the Cabinet, he has been ditched from the Cabinet, that is the ranking this Government applies to the portfolio of trade—I have heard him refer to percentage increases in exports to Asian countries. It is very interesting that, when we analyse the figures, the story is very different indeed. The tragedy of the lost opportunities under this Government is not confined to the misery that has been inflicted on the great bulk of Australians, it is also revealed by the statistics on international trade, particularly in the Asian region. Looking at our exports in terms of market share, not in volume, because one would expect the volume to be increasing, if one is caught in the slipstream of growth in the Asian area one will lift the number of products and value of services exported. The test of improvement is whether there is a gain in market share. That is the only test. Is the market share going up or is it remaining static?

The Government is caught simply in the slipstream of growth in Asia. Rather than talk about how proud they are that the exports are going up, those opposite ought to hang their heads collectively in shame when the ANU produces figures that show the market share in the majority of countries is static or going backwards.

         The export market development grants, which are amended here and are to be applied also to new markets beyond the eight grants that have been made, are helpful. But how much more helpful if the exporters did not have to pay wholesale sales tax, payroll tax, fuel excise, et cetera, as will be the situation under us. The challenge for Australia is to ensure that the environment is there for exporters to be able to really compete, to lift our market share. Through a lift also in gross domestic product we will obtain a lift in living standards for Australia. When we say that the heart and the core of our foreign and trade policies will be trade, we are saying so not merely because the Cold War is over, but because we have a cold war in a different form, if you like, imposed on the Australian people at present. If people are not in exports or in business, they may well not survive in the years ahead. Where there is an opportunity to export, we will grow and prosper. But for this to go ahead we have to create that environment by the abolition of the six existing taxes, relief to the extent of $1.7 billion to Australians.

         I think it is fair to say that a fair number of people have taken advantage of the export market development grants. The figures I have show that Austrade processed 2,002 claims for grants under the export market development scheme, and paid $143m for the 1990-91 grant year. This compared with 3,035 claims, with a value of $179.6m in the 1989-90 grant year. The decline in numbers and values was, as I understand it, attributed to the changes in the scheme which came into effect on 1 July 1990. In 1991-92 a total of 2,401 claims were processed at a total value of $127.4m.

The honourable member seems to be frozen in the past. He is an honourable gentleman, and I have a great affection for him, but he has that defect in many ways. He told us about opposing six taxes. Let me take just one tax that he wants to abolish—incidentally, it is a State tax—and that is payroll tax. Most people in tourism do not pay payroll tax, which is a tremendous benefit for them. Given the States rights policy of the Opposition, we wonder how it would go about convincing the States that they ought to abolish their payroll tax. Small business would be burdened with the collection of a goods and services tax. In terms of the administration of such a tax, every sale, every transaction, has to have a hard copy record. All invoices, all documents, have to be kept for seven years. Each tourism operator would be hiring a caravan or building some additions just to house the pieces of paper which would be involved, apart from the heavy cost of having staff involved in recording all of the transactions.

         We need to look at what has happened to small business in Canada under the imposition of a goods and services tax. Many Canadians cross over the border and go to the United States to do their shopping because of the effect of the imposition of a GST. Small business has been hit very hard there in two ways: firstly, by the costs of collection of a goods and services tax; and, secondly, by the loss of trade that small business suffers as a result of people leaving Canada to shop across the border.

That is what the airlines in this country used to do under the two-airline agreement. They chased each other for decades about getting market share when all the time, even from Opposition days, we were saying, `It is not market share that is important; it is market size that is important'. I say to my dear colleague opposite that I would rather have 10 per cent of a billion dollar market—$100m—than 20 per cent of a $250m market, which is $50m. It is simple: 20 per cent of $250m is $50m; 10 per cent of $1 billion is $100m. The honourable member would make an awful bookkeeper. He would not survive at all.

Our trade surplus with Japan has doubled in real terms—from $2.1 billion in 1986-87 to $4.4 billion in 1991-92. Maybe the honourable member for Kooyong is like that pregnant cow that Fred Daly has talked about a lot. It knew that something wonderful was happening but it was not quite sure how it had occurred.

People have been benefiting from the export market development grants. They welcome this amendment, as does industry generally, because it opens up new horizons for them. There is one thing that we have to do with our exporters. The culture in this country is changing and we have to help people—we have to help business people—through that process of change. I refer to some companies in the Hunter region. Stebercraft of Taree is a boat building firm, and Bud-Pak is marketing a product for the packaging of sugar on board ships, where the machinery is fitted into the ships. It is a very successful Australian design. The sugar is loaded onto the vessel in bulk. The vessel pulls into the port and the packaging is done automatically on the vessel and then delivered onto the wharf.

Assistance has been given in the manufacture of models such as the space shuttle model. That firm has had some difficulties and liquidity problems, but the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development (Mr Kerin), in earlier statements in this place and elsewhere, has pointed to the fact that we have to take some risks in this exercise. It is not just about giving assistance and support to those firms that can prove continuing success. In the life of a business there will be ups and downs.

         I conclude on this note: in all of these things there needs to be a change in culture in this country towards export—we need to become much more export oriented—but there is one area that yet needs to be overhauled, and that is the journey from the warehouse to the wharf. The Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure of this Parliament reported on that in April this year. Last Monday week in Sydney, we held a very successful forum involving exporters, importers and all the providers of services involved. It was the widest cross-section that I have ever seen collected in one auditorium of people involved in those areas. It was an excellent exercise. But what came out of it, as we on the Committee know very well, is that there is a widespread ignorance amongst exporters of how to go about exporting, how to go about minimising their costs of getting their products from their warehouse or their factory to on board a ship.

         We have heard a great deal about the waterfront, but only about inside the dock gate. It is unfortunate that the mainstream media in this country are still locked inside the waterfront gate; they have not got outside the dock. There are problems on the dock. They have been addressed, and the industry readily acknowledges that. But the bigger problem identified as far back as 1984 and 1986 is the cost of getting the product from the warehouse, the factory, the farm or the mine to the wharf.

         I end with these words: we have to do a great deal more as a nation in alerting exporters and importers to the need for them to look at their methods and practices and at how they can coordinate with the waterfront. They are commercial problems. They are not regulatory problems. They are not government problems. These are commercial problems and they demand a commercial solution. I hope that the mainstream media can find the key to the dock gate, open it up, go outside, start along the journey from the warehouse to the wharf, and help to further the exports of this nation.

         —I thank both the honourable member for Kooyong (Mr Peacock) and the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris) for their contributions in the course of this debate on the Export Market Development Grants Amendment Bill. I would like just to touch on one or two points raised in those contributions.

         Firstly, the point must be made that the extension of this scheme is a recognition of the high external costs of exporting and, in a global sense, the extremely competitive environment that Australian exporters face in trying to break into new markets. The point that was made about Australian exporters getting into Asia particularly is one that I do not think is lost on the Government nor, from the honourable member for Kooyong's comments, on the Opposition.

         I pick up also the concluding remarks of the honourable member for Shortland. In the last several months I have had the opportunity of participating in some trade discussions in a number of Asian economies. I have talked to people involved in business councils between, say, Thailand and Australia, Japan and Australia and so on. The thing that strikes me very clearly is the notion that the hard yakka, the hard work that has to be put into breaking into those markets, must come from the exporters themselves. Governments can do so much. They can give assistance through these sorts of grant schemes. Austrade, certainly, can provide opportunities through introductions through our posts overseas and so on. It can open up the gates. But at the end of the day it is the exporters themselves and the Australian business community that must put in the hard work.

         It was suggested to me that there are a number of ways in which this might be achieved, which might increase the opportunities of getting into Asian markets. The first is by entering into joint ventures. The second is to have people located on the ground in these economies. Too often we find that Australian, American or whatever exporters think, `There is a lucrative market in Asia now. It is an expanding economy and is growing rapidly. The growth rates are enormous. It will be easy to get into the market. We will fly in one day, talk to a couple of people, wrap up a contract and then disappear again'. But that just does not happen. We have to change the export culture in Australia. We have to get into the psyche of those countries and realise that it is hard work. Equally, once having identified the markets that we as Australians are targeting, we have to learn something about not only the economics of the market but also the social conditions and the social mores of the market in which we are trying to establish a foothold.

         I have said time and time again that, if Australian companies and leaders in Australian industry have a point to put to anybody in government in this country, it is a matter of their picking up the telephone and phoning either an Opposition spokesman on trade or the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development (Mr Kerin), making an appointment and coming in to see those people. That does not happen in many economies around the world. So we have to expose our Australian exporters to this new culture.

         The other point that I make is in relation to the comments by the honourable member for Kooyong about there perhaps being an overemphasis within the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade on achieving a successful outcome in GATT and the Uruguay Round. I think those comments underplay an enormous amount of work which the Minister for Trade and Overseas Development has done in the area of bilateral trade. Last month he was in Germany and in former eastern European countries leading a trade mission—in the company, I might say, of Hugh Morgan and others—to establish opportunities for Australia in that expanding market. At the moment he is in Korea, on behalf of Australia, spreading the word about Australia at a major trade expo.

         About 100 of these bilateral trade agreements have been established between Australia and other countries. So I do not think it is fair and realistic to say that we have simply put all of our eggs into one basket on the question of trade. Yes, multilateral trade through the GATT and Uruguay Round negotiations is extremely important. I think both sides of the Parliament agree with that.

         As I have said, we have developed strong bilateral trade relationships as well and we have also become very enmeshed in regional and subregional trade arrangements. I refer, in particular, to the APEC process. I know that there has been some discussion from both sides of this Parliament and in a wider context about what our future should hold as far as our regional approach to trade is concerned. When one considers that the Australian economy is as big as that of the ASEAN countries all put together and yet the ASEAN countries are expanding remarkably, as is north-east Asia and other market opportunities, it is clear to everyone that a regional or subregional approach to some of our trade and our trade negotiations is just as critical as are the GATT negotiations or many of these bilateral relationships which have been established through joint ministerial commissions and so on.

         I will conclude, because there is a guillotine motion in place on this legislation, by saying that we would hope that the successful conclusion of the GATT Uruguay Round negotiations will give a fillip of $US170 billion to $US250 billion to global trade. This is a massive injection which will impact on Australia.

It should be noted that, of the 110,000 Australian pensioners receiving British pension payments, about 50,000 already receive the maximum Australian pension because of the operation of the free area, and therefore they will not receive the additional pension.

         —I welcome this opportunity to speak on the Migration Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) and the Immigration (Education) Charge Bill of 1992. Lest there be any ambiguity about this matter at a later point, I want to make it clear that we will not be opposing the Bills. I want to make it very clear on behalf of the Opposition that we regard the teaching of English to new arrivals where they do not have English language capacity as one of the most important aspects of their successful settlement in Australia. They cannot achieve integration over time unless they have the ability to communicate within the society. For that reason, the teaching of English is of fundamental concern. That concern is one that is outlined very clearly in our policy. It is a commitment that our parties have had over a long period.

         The Government has been involved internally in a whole lot of matters of contest about the education issue and the provision of English language courses. It may not always involve Ministers, but there is often a good deal of internecine warfare in relation to the way in which funding for government programs proceeds. In the recent Budget and in the joint statement by the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand) and his colleague, we see a working out of those difficult relationships. The Government over time has given certain commitments to English language tuition and to the development of language policies, but in no way does that bring us to a point, when we look at the culmination of all these reports and the Government's efforts to develop an Australian language and literacy policy, where these matters have been worked through.

         It is important to understand in the field of adult teaching of English to speakers of another language that there are seven or so alternative programs under which the provision of English language teaching can proceed. We have the adult migrant education program, administered by this Minister's Department, for recently arrived immigrants; the English as a second language courses which are components of the labour market training programs administered through the Department of Employment, Education and Training, and they also occur within industry restructuring programs administered through the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce; the workplace reform programs which are administered through the Department of Industrial Relations; the English as a second language provision within universities, from recurrent or access or equity funding; the State funded programs within TAFE, where the Commonwealth has a very heavy involvement; the English as a foreign language program for overseas students at private and public institutions, involving the ELICOS courses in particular; and the English language intensive courses for overseas students which are conducted overseas or in Australia as part of Australia's aid expenditure program through AIDAB.

         So we can see that there is an enormous complexity in the numbers of programs and the numbers of people and various government bodies—statutory authorities and departments—that are involved in the teaching of English. There are quite variable standards in relation to the outcomes; there are quite variable outcomes in value for money and the way in which the Commonwealth is able to measure results.

         The AMEP was developed first in the early 1950s and then, with the development of courses for migrant professionals in 1969, universities were involved in offering assistance. We had the commencement in 1974 of English in the workplace and the home tutor schemes. We had the rapid growth and the provision from 1978, as a result of the Galbally report, of a whole range of services for refugees at migrant hostels, establishing dedicated teaching accommodation for adult migrant education. In 1985 we had the Campbell review, initiated by this Government, which enhanced the professional infrastructure of AMEP, and particularly the establishment of the National Centre for English Language Teaching and Research at Macquarie University. From 1990 to 1992 we had the national plan which defined the limits of AMEP, consistent with the report of the Committee to Advise on Australia's Immigration Policies.

         It is in that context that it is important to note that there is a Commonwealth involvement and there are also State involvements. We have seen in the AMEP area particularly, I gather, quite independent evaluation of the benefits of that program. One of the outcomes of an evaluation by the Department of Finance is that it is estimated that the AMEP program operates, at a unit cost, 38 per cent more cheaply than the funded programs in the ESL area by DEET. That is a very important factor. I am told that this is despite the fact that the largest component of costs, the teachers' salaries, was the same at least within the State systems and, of course, that the large differential that does occur is because of the management systems that DEET in particular adopts.

         The fact of the matter is that the AMEP program has brought about a very important national standard in relation to delivery of services. We have seen a standard approach to the assessment of learner proficiency, at entry to and exit from programs, and we have seen a high level of teacher qualifications, and this is very important. We have seen an improvement in productivity in recent years, particularly in relation to the way in which the program itself is operating. We have seen a shared cost-efficient approach to the development of curricula. Instead of each State developing all curriculum materials, the work has been distributed so that there are certain advantages achieved from that.

         We have seen the development of the concept of learner pathways by which students can move from one course to another without repetition of content. I am sure the benefits that have been derived from all this work could be very readily shared were there more effective relationships between the providers of the various programs, and if the internecine warfare that has been going on departmentally was a matter that Ministers had the capacity to resolve. I do not believe that that resolution has occurred, and I very much doubt the Minister's ability in that contest when I look at the outcome that is announced in the statement to which the Minister referred in his second reading speech.

I just make the point that the Minister in his statement said that the Commonwealth spent $114.5m in 1991-92 on English as a second language training, and that came from DILGEA, his Department, at $101m, and the Department of Employment, Education and Training at $13.5m. In the year we are now addressing, 1992-93, the Commonwealth will spend $142m, comprising $138.2m from the Budget and $3.65m from user charging, of which his Department will spend $99.65m—that is, $96m from the Budget plus $3.65m raised through user charging. In absolute terms we have seen a reduction of $1.5m. DEET is to spend $42.2m, a much larger sum, and we are told that those measures follow on from the Australian language and literacy policy of 1991.

         I think it will be far more important for the Government to spend time developing an overall policy to achieve better outcomes in relation to these matters, building upon the advantages that have been achieved through the AMEP program and ensuring that there is a rational framework in which all of the programs that I have mentioned operate. I want to make it very clear that, regardless of whether the Government is working in this area, the Opposition is, and it is certainly our intention that there be an overall framework of policy bringing together all of the programs in which these benefits can be clearly seen and which are available for the teaching of English.

         This legislation addresses the very significant outstanding problems relating to the provision of resources for teaching English to new arrivals. It is very clear from the inquiries that the Government has taken out that the resources that it presently provides, applied on the basis that they are applied, cannot provide sufficient teaching of English to all of the people entering Australia under the immigration program as it has recently been structured. Therefore, the whole question of resources and the way in which people are admitted for migration need to be addressed.

         Because of the ability to address these questions in relation to the way in which the services are provided, and to achieve economies by using the most efficient system overall, other changes had to occur. We have seen the introduction of the requirement that people entering Australia through the concessional category for migration, and those entering under the independent migration category, will now be subjected in their points testing to an assessment as to their English language capacity. English language competency will be a determining factor in many cases as to whether people are successful in migration.

         I am not complaining about that because, as has been revealed in certain research tabled this week at the Bureau of Immigration Research Conference in Sydney, the costs of immigration to the Australian taxpayer in the short to medium term, at both a Commonwealth and a State level, are quite significant. It is only when it is extended over a period of 10 years that one starts to see benefits from immigration in terms of Commonwealth outlays. That is a factor.

This is the very reason for a smaller immigration program and for testing for English language competency. The Minister was encouraged by the Opposition to move in this area. The honourable member for Calwell might like to say that not only was the Minister encouraged, but he followed policy suggestions made by the Opposition.

The honourable member for Calwell might tell us that the Minister did that with his assistance. It will be interesting to hear his comments to see whether he wants to take credit for that initiative.

         —Is it the Minister's initiative or the initiative of the honourable member for Calwell? The point is that what we have now is legislation to introduce a scheme in respect of new migrants entering Australia who do not have functional English. It is a scheme of charging for education. In it there are exemptions to cover refugees; special assistance and humanitarian categories; spouse, child and aged parent classes in the preferential family category; and other classes as yet to be prescribed. In effect, only those entering through the concessional family and independent categories, I suppose, will be required to pay tuition fees. These will operate on a sliding scale with the maximum fee being $4,080. That scheme is outlined in the Immigration (Education) Charge Bill.

         The Migration Laws Amendment Bill (No. 2) deals with the provision of English language tuition. Under its provisions, if a new migrant has in fact paid the charge or is exempt from its application and becomes a permanent resident, the Commonwealth will be obliged to provide that person with English language tuition for 510 hours—and 510 hours is estimated to be the average amount of tuition needed for a non-English speaker to acquire functional English. The program ceases if the person does not register within certain time limits that are specified. The Bill provides for user charging for existing migrants who enrol in the AMEP program after 1 January 1993, and the maximum fee that can be set will be $250 per student.

         Because of the time limitations, I will simply say that there are certain other amendments proposed in this legislation. Those amendments deal with an anomaly that is to be removed in relation to the duty to consider a refugee status application so as to make it clear that there is no duty to consider applications by certain classes of persons. It also inserts a power to require passengers travelling on domestic routes to international flights to produce evidence of authority to be in Australia. It also inserts a new power to make regulations concerning the use of the decision-making process and certain opinions, findings and assessments or decisions by third parties or agencies. To remove uncertainty, the Bill ensures that regulations which have already been made in that area will be made validly. There is a provision to correct a recently discovered anomaly in amendments to the Act which removed the previous arrangements for people to be granted permanency by absorption.

I want to put on the record the reasons why we support this legislation and why I believe that the matters that have been raised with me—particularly by the New South Wales Teachers Federation and the Federation of Ethnic Communities Councils, amongst others—if the Government wishes to press them, can be pressed on another day.

         The major issue upon which a contest has been raised with the Government relates to the maximum entitlement to English tuition for newly arrived migrants to be 510 hours. My reading of the Bill—and I am not sure that those who comment on these matters have in fact read the Bill—suggests that what is undertaken in clause 6 is an obligation. It is not a maximum entitlement; it is an obligation that the Commonwealth will assume. Proposed new section 4C states:

         —Yes, because it is an obligation. It is something that people will be able to enforce. It is not prescribing a minimum or a maximum; it is prescribing an obligation on the part of the Commonwealth, because the charges are to be made. It does not, as I understand it, mean that the Minister could not provide additional tuition under this legislation if that were his desire. I do not know what his desire is. The framework in which these matters operate often requires regulations. It may well be that when we read the detailed statement, and when regulations are brought in at a later point, what is prescribed as the obligation will be all that the Commonwealth will do. That may well be the case, but it certainly does not seem to me that the provision is one which ought to be reviewed for that reason.

         There are claims that there have been restrictions placed upon access to the adult migrant education scheme. That might well be the case. This is a Budget Bill, and our view is that it is therefore not reasonable to oppose it. But the reason for the format in which these matters are being addressed, the transfer of funds to DEET and the implementation of the programs in other ways, is the difficulty that the Government has had in resolving this contest.

         The restrictions that we have in this area will lead to people having to apply for support in other areas if they do not meet them. One of those is the area of courses which are provided for permanent residents, and that comes under section 4A, where lesser fees are charged and under which the holders of health cards and registered job seekers are exempted. Obviously, for those who do not fall within those categories, other fees may be payable, and people who are in otherwise necessitous circumstances may not be able to meet them. They are matters that, as I read the proposed section, the Minister will presumably otherwise regulate, although that is a matter upon which I would need to read the section more closely.

In other words, it is the Minister's obligation to provide English language tuition within approved courses of English study which are prescribed in proposed new sections 4A and 4B. There is some latitude, I suspect, in relation to the way in which those provisions might operate and as to where those approved courses may be provided.

This is a relevant matter because when I was overseas a number of comments were made about this issue, not the least by the honourable member for Dundas who keeps issuing press statements about what he takes to be the overwhelming majority position of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration Regulations on this matter.

         Yesterday, the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), in a speech to the BIR conference, referred to this issue and tried to make much of the claim that an overwhelming parliamentary majority is in favour of the position adopted by the honourable member for Dundas and himself. However, the reality is that there are nine members of the Joint Standing Committee on Migration Regulations. Of those nine members, two dissented from the position that we should not fulfil the commitment given by two Prime Ministers to the Chinese students. The two members who dissented were Senator Cooney and I. In addition, when the honourable member for Melbourne Ports (Mr Holding) returned from overseas, even though he was included in the majority, he dissented. I have also spoken to the honourable member for Adelaide (Mr Catley) who is more inclined to support fulfilling the commitment of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating).

The fact is that the honourable member for Dundas, who has been going around pretending that there is a massive majority on the Committee in favour of the position, has found that that position has been somewhat whittled away since he started making public statements. The final result is that, effectively, we have a 5 : 4 position on the Committee in relation to this matter. That is very different from the claims made by the honourable member for Dundas.

He wanted to emphasise the reasons why he took that position. As Chairman of the Committee, I agree that I should emphasise his reasons, which were that `non-discriminatory criteria are an important principle in Australia's refugee determination system'. He felt that was the reason that he should go with the majority position. The reality is that we have a public debate.

         —What is the honourable member talking about? The Migration Regulations Committee considered the matter and deferred it until my return. It considered the matter again only yesterday. What is the honourable member saying? The reality is that I was attacked on this issue unfairly while I was overseas. When the Committee considered it as part of its agenda it decided, properly, to defer the matter until I came back, which is the honourable course and  which, unfortunately, neither the honourable member for Moore nor the honourable member for Dundas pursued.

         I refer now to the very important changes to migration education. The honourable member for Dundas has pointed out that there is to be a public meeting to consider these matters. No doubt this public meeting will be organised in such a way as to attack the Government. However, if we look at the proposals in the legislation, we see that they are being put in place to guarantee 510 hours tuition for every person.

         —Tonight we are discussing the Sex Discrimination and other Legislation Amendment Bill and the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2). My approach and the approach of the coalition to questions of sex, race, disability or other discrimination starts from the proposition that each person is entitled as an individual to fundamental respect and dignity. We believe that people should be treated with respect as individuals and that they should in Australia of today have the freedom to dream their own dreams and to fulfil their own potential; that they should have the opportunity by talent and diligence to be rewarded for their efforts; and that if they should experience prejudice in some way, be it because of their religion, race, sex or anything else, that is offensive to the notion of the individual dignity of each person.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         As far as I and the coalition are concerned, we find it offensive that people might be dismissed from employment because of the colour of their skin or refused service in clubs or hotels or be treated in some way as less than full human beings because of their sex or marriage or potential pregnancy. Because we feel that way, and feel that way strongly, we believe that there is a very important place for anti-discrimination law—anti-discrimination law that says that people should be treated equally on the basis of their talent and their ability and what they have to offer; anti-discrimination law that says that it is offensive to treat somebody as less than a full citizen with full rights because of his race; anti-discrimination law that provides a remedy against injustice.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         I believe that there is a deep sense of injustice in many circumstances where discrimination occurs—for women in the work force who see men of lesser ability promoted over them, or for people unable to get jobs because they are women and therefore deemed to be likely to fall pregnant at some time or another and not rewarded on the basis of their ability. There is a place for anti-discrimination law that gives a remedy for injustice. There is also a place for anti-discrimination law that performs an educative role, that says to the community at large: we, as a tolerant society, believe in these ideals and these values; we, as a tolerant society, find offensive conduct that falls short of those desires and those ideals.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         One of the advantages of anti-discrimination law is that over the years it has performed that educational role and changed community perceptions and attitudes. One might say it was changing community perceptions and attitudes which led to the law, or one might say that the law has led to the change in attitudes. But if they are mutually reinforcing, so much the better. In the area of anti-discrimination law there is always the risk that the Parliament, the State, the opinion formers or the opinion leaders can go too far. If there is one thing that could really hamper equality of opportunity in this country, it is that there might be an over-reaction in one form or another. As I said before, discrimination law is there to prevent injustice, but if it should ever become the tool of injustice by overreaching then it would be destructive and, indeed, destroy laudable objectives that it is otherwise directed towards.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         We have seen developments in the United States where there has been over-reaction. We have seen policies of bussing where black children were bussed into white neighbourhoods and white children were bussed into black neighbourhoods. This was all done in the name of anti-discrimination, but I believe the policy was fundamentally flawed and, if anything, would lead to a hostile reaction. We have also seen it in the United States in relation to quotas which say that in universities or in jobs it is important to have such and such a per cent of a particular race or a particular sex, and, regardless of ability or merit, affirmative action steps in and makes those places available.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         As far as I am concerned, affirmative action which goes to bussing and quotas or says that people ought to be promoted or rewarded not on the basis of ability but on the basis of sex or race or some other distinguishing characteristic is really no better than straight discrimination. It is inverse discrimination. It looks at a person's race, sex or colour and deals with that person on that basis rather than looking at his or her underlying qualities such as diligence: those things which ought to be taken account of on an equal basis.

It makes it difficult to vote one way or t'other on a Bill like this, but I wish to outline on behalf of the Opposition where we stand in relation to the individual proposals.

         I come first to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1992. Essentially, this Bill does two things. First, it provides for an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner within the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. The Commissioner is to report yearly on the exercise of human rights by Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders. He is to monitor what is done by Commonwealth, State and Territory authorities in the field and to report to Parliament on the progress that has been made in respect of Aboriginal human rights. That is something we welcome.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The coalition believes that the position of Aborigines in our society is still not what it ought to be and that they still suffer from ingrained disadvantage. We welcome proposals to remedy that. That is not to say that we are happy about turning this into an industry, because I do not believe creating an industry around disadvantage in the end helps the disadvantaged. But where there are sensible proposals that can advance the position of Aboriginal people, we welcome them. We would like to see the position of Aboriginal people in our society enhanced.

         Secondly, this Bill proposes that the Sex Discrimination Act, which currently renders it unlawful to discriminate on the basis of sex, should also render it unlawful to discriminate in employment on the basis of family obligation. We see this as an important recognition of the institution of the family in our society. Just as we would find it offensive for somebody to be dismissed from employment by reason of his or her marriage or sex, so too we would find it offensive for somebody to be dismissed by reason of having family obligations.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The legislation is to be welcomed for introducing prohibitions on dismissal in employment on the grounds of family status. It elevates the importance of the family to the same elevation that the Act gives in relation to sex, pregnancy and marriage. This is not to say that somebody in employment could say, `I have young children to mind and, therefore, if I leave at 3 o'clock every afternoon I can't be dismissed, even though my job might be from 9 to 5', or, `Because I can't get to work on time, I can't be affected in any other way because that would amount to family discrimination'.

         The Bill does not say that, because discrimination occurs where somebody is treated less favourably than another person in the same circumstances. If, for example, a person with family responsibilities were doing a 9 to 5 job the same as a person without family responsibilities and the person with family responsibilities was dismissed, one would be treating that person less favourably than the other person in like circumstances. If the two people are not in like circumstances—if one person is working a 9 to 5 day and the other one is leaving early—one cannot say it is discrimination by reason of family responsibilities. Nor would we say the legislation should ever apply in a situation such as that.

We would hope that employers would be neutral as to the private circumstances of a person's life. But in the circumstance where a person is not performing to the requirements of the position and where a fair day's work is expected for a fair day's pay, that would not take away the rights of the employer.

         I come now to the sex discrimination amendments. In part, the amendments that come forward in this Sex Discrimination and other Legislation Amendment Bill 1992 come from an inquiry conducted by the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs chaired by the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Lavarch). It was a long inquiry and the report contained some good and some bad recommendations. To his credit, the honourable member for Fisher worked at it diligently for a long time and took a lot of evidence. I commend him for his efforts. However, the recent interest of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in this particular topic is wholly different. It is wholly new found and wholly politically driven. I would not for a moment put the honourable member for Fisher on the same low level as the Prime Minister in respect of the honourable member's interest in this particular subject.

         As I said before, there are some bad recommendations in that report which I would disagree with. I would not support the recommendation to extend the Sex Discrimination Act in its application to religious organisations. If somebody holds a bona fide religious belief which means that, in accordance with the tenets of that religion, he does not believe there should be interchangeable roles for men and women, I think he ought to have the freedom to exercise that belief. For example, I would oppose the thought of applying the Sex Discrimination Act to the Catholic Church by saying, `You are discriminating because you don't have women priests'. I think that there should be full freedom in that area to abide by religious belief. The honourable member for Fisher says that this would be the situation only in relation to religious organisations where the requirement was reasonable. We have that rider on it.

I do not think we should apply the Sex Discrimination Act to that situation if, in accordance with religious beliefs, it requires that particular staffing arrangement. The Government is getting into the very difficult area of conflict of human rights, which I certainly would not resolve against religious freedom.

         There is added protection in this legislation for people who lodge complaints, and that is a good thing. If the Government wants people to take up the conciliation mechanism, they must know that if they lodge a complaint they will be protected. We support the parts of the Bill that deal with that. The Bill contains an added mechanism for enforcement. Under this proposal, if the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission makes a determination, it can be registered in the Federal Court and there are 28 days in which to apply for a review. Unless a review is applied for, it becomes enforceable. If a review is applied for, all issues of fact and law can be reconsidered, but no new evidence can be entered.

         I hope that, by the same token, if the matter is reviewed, any evidence that has been taken by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission that is not admissible for the purposes of the Court or is unreliable would be also taken out. I would not like to see a situation in which a commission that does not operate in accordance with the rules of evidence effectively binds the Court in relation to admissible evidence. The sensible part of that proposal is that it is a more straightforward mechanism for determination. The obligation will be upon the people who are taking the action to bring out all the evidence in the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission rather than to hold back evidence and take their chances on a de novo rehearing in the Federal Court.

         It is an interesting mechanism also because we have no enforceable orders in the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission because of the separation of the judicial and non-judicial power. Whether this proposal gets around it is an open question. I foreshadow that there will be an open argument at one point on the constitutionality of that provision. If it is unconstitutional, the Opposition will not support it but, until it is declared to be unconstitutional, we will assume it is valid and we will support it. It will also be possible to complain of sexual harassment in a wider class of cases, such as the provision of goods and services or accommodation, or where sexual harassment goes on in unions. I think that most women find it offensive to have lewd suggestions made to them, and as far as possible we should discourage such conduct.

         There are some things in this Act that are plain silly; for example, the provisions in this Act to introduce group complaints—not only in the Sex Discrimination Act but also in the Racial Discrimination Act and the Disability Discrimination Bill. Under the proposal put forward in this Bill, to make a group complaint of sex discrimination or race discrimination, a person just describes the class and all people in that class are joined into that complaint unless they go down and take themselves out of it. That is offensive to the notions of justice. How can my rights be determined by somebody who takes an action and describes a class that includes me? How can my rights be determined just because I did not get down there, maybe did not even know about it—probably did not know about it—and did not pull myself out of it? The provisions go on to say that people whose rights are determined as part of a class cannot take their own complaint later on. Their rights have been subsumed into the class. This is the idea that the Labor Party loves of class justice, class litigation and class determination of rights—all in the context of legislation that is supposed to be looking after the dignity of the individual.

         The fundamental point about justice is that, if people have complaints they make them, and they have their cases determined on the merits and facts of their cases. People do not have their rights distinguished by somebody else who says, `You're a member of a class that has a cause of action', who leads all the evidence and has the determination before they have even heard of it, so that when people want to take their own complaints, they are told, `Sorry, your rights have gone. Mr X was down here. He's already had your case for you. Your rights have been extinguished. They were taken in as part of the class'. How ridiculous! It is offensive to the ordinary notions of justice and it will be unworkable. I had hoped to move during this debate amendments to take out those provisions. This debate is being guillotined and I probably will not have the opportunity to move them formally. Because the debate has been brought on very quickly, we have not had as much time as we would like to have had to draw up the amendments carefully.

How many government employees do we need to talk to each other in this country? There is one easy answer to avoiding the sexist award, and that is to make good appointments, or maybe even to have an educational workshop for the Australian Industrial Relations Commission. I would not wish an educational workshop on anybody, but that seemed to me to be a much better idea than opening up cases so that the Sex Discrimination Commissioner can lecture the Australian Industrial Relations Commission on sexism in its awards.

         I take the interest of the honourable member for Fisher in this matter seriously. The Prime Minister introduced this Bill. He has a newfound interest in women's issues. It is a newfound interest which is born wholly out of the desire to secure women's votes at the next election. He is no recently born-again lion of women's rights. We have only to read what he said in the Parliament when he first came here to see what his views are. Great lions of women's rights who have effectively been running the Government since 1983 do not move amendments to the Sex Discrimination Act on the eve of an election.

         Any poll will tell us that the Prime Minister fares badly with the women vote. His problem is not that he does not move enough amendments to the Sex Discrimination Act but that, in his every appearance, with his gutter language and vicious personal attacks, with his braggery and bravado, he offends women. The Prime Minister is now talking about taking violence off television, or putting it back to 9.30 at night. I think he ought to put the replay of Question Time—that is why it has to be replayed so late at night—on at 9.30 at night, because people will see as much violence and bad example from the Prime Minister in Question Time as they are ever going to see from a public figure. The bravado, the braggery and the personal attacks—all of the things that give this Prime Minister a problem with women—derive from the way in which he carries on the political affairs of this country. It is not from the fact that he does not move enough amendments to the Sex Discrimination Act.

         What women voters see—in fact, what all Australian voters see—is a confrontationist, divisive and aggressive Prime Minister. That is his problem.

They know that he cannot fix the problem in Australia because he caused it. They, as much as anybody else, want to see an economy where they have a chance of a job or, if they choose to look after their children and family, where their husbands have a chance of a job, where there is some security in the home, some future for the children, and some future for them.

         Ensuring that women are treated with dignity and respect in our society involves much more than mere legislation. I am sure those opposite would agree with me on that. It is an attitudinal matter; it is a matter of socialisation; it is a question of the attitudes that children pick up in the family; it is the attitudes they see being passed on to them from their parents; it is the attitudes they see in their leaders; it is the attitudes they see in family life; it is the attitudes they see from the moral leaders of the nation and the churches; and it is the quality of national life. It is much bigger than legislation. It is directing to all of those facets an attitude that is passed on from generation to generation that says people should be treated on the basis of ability and merit, without discrimination for their colour, or their sex, or their marriage, or their family. That is the best hope for ensuring that we do away with offensive discrimination in this country; that is the best hope—it is not a legislative answer alone. As I said before, the role of the legislation is to remedy obvious injustice and to engage in an educational role, but it is much bigger than that, and something that we must direct ourselves and our attention towards in that multifaceted way.

         —The honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) was quite kind in his comments to me, so I am somewhat reluctant to take a great deal of issue with his contribution. But I am afraid I cannot leave unanswered some of his claims about the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), in particular the sorts of glowing statements which he started his speech with. He started off with the grand, philosophical framework into which these things should be placed, and in particular where the Opposition sits on this matter. I hope I am not quoting him incorrectly, but he said that the Opposition Liberal and National parties strongly support anti-discrimination legislation, and they see a role for it. I am very pleased to hear that because that is in very stark contrast to the initial enactment of this legislation back in only 1984—we are not talking that many years ago—when the legislation was opposed most vigorously by the Liberal and National parties, and it was kept in the Senate for some incredible length of time.

         It should have been a piece of legislation that had a long time for the public to become familiar with and for public consultation and debate because it is important social legislation. I do not decry its having a long gestation period, but I do find it a little bit of a road to Damascus type of conversion now to have this very strong support, this place in the sun for anti-discrimination legislation, because that certainly was not the case in 1984 when the Act was passed.

         I remember going to the election in 1987, when I was elected, and fighting the election campaign. The policy which the Liberal and National parties took into that election was to repeal the Sex Discrimination Act and the Affirmative Action Act. Today, even though they no longer hold that view, it is still their attitude and their stated policy to abolish the Affirmative Action Agency and have the functions of that Agency taken on by the Department of Industrial Relations, while at the same time cutting in half the resources given to that department. I find that a little hollow—although I am pleased to see the broad, philosophical framework—in terms of past actions.

         He went on to talk about the Bills and where he saw good points in them. In relation to the amendments to the Sex Discrimination Act, he said he was agreeing with three of them. The first one dealt with the changes to the victimisation provisions, to allow complaints of victimisation to be proceeded with by way of conciliation rather than simply being a matter that had to go straight to the court. I welcome that support. He also indicated support for the change in the enforcement procedures relating to determinations of the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. I very much welcome that because I think it is an improvement; it will make it a lot more straightforward and it will give people some sort of extra encouragement to pursue their rights knowing that, at the end of the day, if the determination is made in their favour, the thing is not utterly worthless because the whole process has to go to the Federal Court and be argued completely again. That is not to say that the Court does not play an important role in these matters, and that it should not be a full court review; that is not changed by these amendments.

         The third element of change where the honourable member indicated the support of the Opposition concerned the sexual harassment provisions. I very much welcome that support of the Opposition. It is an important issue in terms of the operation of the Sex Discrimination Act. The honourable member said he thought the definition of `harassment' was a bit wide and vague and could conceivably bring in all manner of behaviour. The point I would make is that this is an objective test to be determined at first instance by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission if a complaint is made. It is not purely a subjective test of someone saying, `Look, I felt humiliated or hard-done by by the conduct'. It has to have been actions which a reasonable person would regard as humiliating or degrading. Hence in that way I do not believe it is nearly as vague as the honourable member makes out. It is quite a workable definition. It is a definition which has largely existed in Federal legislation since 1984. Similar definitions have existed in State legislation for even longer periods. There is no evidence whatsoever of these definitions being vague, unworkable or anything of the sort.

         There were two areas where the Opposition said it does not support the amendments in this legislation. The first deals with group complaints. What we had from the honourable member for Higgins was simply his arguments against representative actions, which we have heard a few times now, most principally in terms of changes to the Federal Court of Australia Act. I can understand that he has a different point of view about the process of how representative action should work, but that debate is in relation to the broader question of representative actions. What this Act does is merely bring in line different provisions concerning group actions in the Sex Discrimination Act, repeal them and apply the same law as now applies in the rules of the Federal Court. What it is doing is simply standardising the provisions concerning group complaints so that it applies across the board.

         We can have our argument about whether these group complaint provisions are sensible or fair, but that is a broader argument. To pick on this particular legislation and say, `This is wrong in terms of the Sex  Discrimination Act or the Racial Discrimination Act' really misses the point. All we are doing is standardising the provisions. In my mind, like provisions in like legislation should be the same. I think the honourable member misses the point somewhat in his argument there.

         The honourable member for Higgins went on to say that the Opposition opposes the idea that the Sex Discrimination Act should apply to the industrial system, that it should apply to awards. This is a joke. Apparently it is laughable, in the eyes of the Opposition, that the Sex Discrimination Commissioner should have any role in making an application to the Industrial Relations Commission and arguing that a provision in an award is discriminatory. What I would say to the honourable member is that if he did at some stage have the opportunity to go through the evidence that was put to the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs on this point—we did receive very good evidence in relation to the application of the Act in this area—he would see that it was pointed out that there were numerous awards that still contain discriminatory provisions and that it was quite ridiculous that this area of Australian society should be exempt from the general rules which are outlined in the Sex Discrimination Act.

         A similar provision to this has operated for some years in the Western Australian legislation. That particular Act applies to State awards in Western Australia and to the industrial system over there. It has not caused great ridicule or problem. People have not seen it as terribly ridiculous that the State commissioner over there has a role in these matters. Given the industrial relations approach of the Opposition, which is basically saying that there is no role for a central umpire in this, to have as a starting point the application of the Sex Discrimination Act in the industrial system, I think, will be a very important safeguard to the position of women workers.

He may well have a point there, but I suggest to him that the same public opinion polling is showing the very poor standing of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson)—also amongst Australian women—and I would suggest that the same criticism can be laid very much at his door.

         —It is somewhat unusual for a Minister to participate in a debate in this manner and I thank the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) for allowing me to do so and relinquishing his speaking rights. I pay tribute to the Opposition for its support for the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) but, most important of all, I pay tribute to the Attorney-General (Mr Duffy) who has been unstinting in his support for giving effect to what I think the whole Parliament recognises as a very important reform. I seek to speak briefly on the Bill because I have a very strong commitment to this proposal and some significant degree of involvement in making it happen.

         The establishment of an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner is a direct result of the first recommendation of the final report of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody. The Commonwealth Government gave support to 338 of 339 of the Royal Commission recommendations and, on the occasion of the twenty-fifth anniversary of the 1967 referendum, the whole Parliament gave support to the Commonwealth response. Importantly, the Commonwealth has backed its commitment with $400m over five years, with targeted reforms addressed to areas of Aboriginal disadvantage. I have been very concerned to ensure that the commitments of governments, those promises of governments given in response to the Royal Commission at the State, Territory and Commonwealth levels, are monitored by a rigorous regime of accountability designed to keep the nation honest in its commitments to Aboriginal people over the coming decade.

         The Bill before the House seeks to establish an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner within the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission and the functions of that Commissioner will include the production of an annual state-of-the-nation report on Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander issues. A commitment to give effect to this initiative was made by the Commonwealth in response to the very first recommendation of the Royal Commission.

         The Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission is, I believe, a highly appropriate body to administer the function of the Social Justice Commissioner. The Commission has had an active involvement in a number of inquiries, including the Toomelah inquiry which raised public awareness of the extent of Aboriginal disadvantage and issues to be addressed by governments. However, I regret to say that there are hundreds of communities, such as Toomelah and Mornington Island, around this country and that is why I believe that a national and independent perspective on the extent of the disadvantage and the action that needs to be taken is so critical. In producing the state-of-the-nation report, the Commissioner will consult with the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community and, of course, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission.

         The work of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner will be greatly supplemented by the extensive information already available to the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission. This initiative is significant because it will also lead to independent scrutiny of the performance of the nation in giving effect to the commitment to social justice, which is an essential part of the reconciliation process.

         —The Opposition will not oppose this Bill. It is the intention of the Opposition to move a second reading amendment in the form that has been circulated. The form of that second reading amendment recapitulates the views of the Opposition regarding affirmative action. We have from time immemorial supported the principle of equal opportunity for all employees. But we have likewise had some reservations about bureaucratic solutions to problems of discrimination in the workplace and have never embraced the notion that equal opportunity for women and men is commensurate with the number of bureaucrats and the size of bureaucracies which are created in order to enhance their position.

         The text of the second reading amendment is to reaffirm the commitment of the House to the principle of equal opportunity for all employees, and I would not imagine that the members of the Government would have any difficulty with that. The second limb of the amendment, which is something that the coalition feels very strongly about, calls upon the Government to support the recruitment, training and promotion of all employees solely on the basis of merit. I would not imagine that any members of the Government would have any difficulty in embracing that part of the amendment. I look forward to the action of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney-General (Mr Duncan), who is at the table and who has carriage of this Bill, in indicating the support of the Government for the second reading amendment.

         There are one or two specific things in the legislation that I would like to comment about. It does remain the view of the coalition that the existence of a separate agency or group in order to enforce this legislation is unnecessary, although we do not intend to vote against this Bill because we would not want in any way to allow it to be suggested that the coalition was opposed to the concept of the equality of opportunity in the workplace. I am a sufficient cynic of the behaviour and the attitude of the Government and of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to imagine that any action of the coalition which was the least bit negative regarding this Bill would be totally misrepresented as some kind of assault upon the status of women in our community.

         The Prime Minister has embarked on a thinly disguised campaign, which the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Lavarch) a few moments ago acknowledged was absolutely necessary in order to repair his electoral stocks with women. As the honourable member for Fisher said, there was a point in the charge that the Prime Minister had a problem with women. I think he is dead right. Anybody who has put as many women out of work as has the Prime Minister has a problem with women. That man has got to go. Anybody who has caused the problem he has caused has no hope at all of fixing it. Anybody who has put as many women and their husbands out of work as this man has done has a real problem with women. He has a real problem with men and with Australians generally.

I hope the Government will have absolutely no problem with the impeccable principle of non-discrimination—an impeccable liberal principle in its broadest sense—that people ought to be recruited on the basis of merit and merit alone. Nothing else should determine the entitlement of somebody to a job.

         —I hope for the sake of the honourable member for Barton (Mr Punch) that he never has to sing for his supper. He will die of famine. The Mutual Recognition Bill, of course, is something that the honourable member for Barton would be well aware of. It forms part of a legislative scheme that involves the enactment of complementary legislation by each of the States and the Commonwealth. The purpose of the scheme is to establish the legal framework for the mutual recognition by the States and Territories of each other's differing regulatory standards regarding goods and occupations.

         The scheme proposes to implement two models of mutual recognition, one applicable to goods and the other to occupations. The objectives of the models are to remove unnecessary impediments to interstate trade in goods arising from differing State and Territory standards and regulations, and artificial barriers to the mobility of labour amongst States and Territories arising from local registration or licensing laws. When implemented, the models will contribute to the creation of a more efficient national market. They will also enhance Australia's international competitiveness.

         Mutual recognition arose out of a series of meetings of Commonwealth, State and Territory heads of government which have been conducted over the past two years with the objective of achieving better intergovernmental relations to improve the operation of the national economy. Agreement was reached by heads of government at the October 1990 Special Premiers Conference to work towards implementing a scheme of mutual recognition throughout Australia, with the aim of removing inefficiencies brought about by varying standards and regulatory regimes, movement of goods and labour in the national markets. The agreement was reached in the context of enhancing the flexibility and competitiveness of the Australian economy.

         The scheme was finalised on 11 May 1992 when heads of government signed the final agreement endorsing a revised version of the legislation substantially in the form now proposed for enactment. The agreement requires the States and Territories to use their best endeavours to pass the necessary legislation by 31 October 1992 and for the Commonwealth to use its best endeavours to pass legislation by 1 January.

         The clear support which the scheme has had from governments of all persuasions is an indication of the importance of mutual recognition to the Australian economy. The whole purpose of Federation was to remove customs and tariff barriers between the States when the six colonies had their own controls over tariffs. There was not free movement of goods throughout the whole of Australia. Federation partially achieved that. The great section 92 of the Constitution was brought in to allow free trade between the States. This is, if you like, another example of cooperative federalism taking the step one stage further.

         The long term benefits of mutual recognition for the Australian economy will be significant. It will facilitate a national market for goods and the free movement of capital and labour. The unnecessary costs to producers in accommodating minor differences in regulatory requirements of States and Territories in relation to goods will be removed. Labour mobility will be enhanced with the removal of artificial barriers linked to registration and licensing laws. This will result in the more efficient use of the skills of the labour force.

         The scheme will also provide some incentive for jurisdictions to review and to rationalise their regulations for various products. In the long term, jurisdictions whose regulations are less costly to meet may attract a greater number of producers. Similarly, producers might be attracted to a jurisdiction because consumers may prefer goods produced in that jurisdiction when it is perceived to impose higher standards. There will also be improved competitiveness due to economies of scale made possible by the rationalisation of manufacturing activities since the output of one plant will be able to be sold throughout Australia without modification or additional specification.

         The mechanism for implementing this scheme is under section 51(xxxvii) of the Commonwealth Constitution. The Territories will request the enactment of a Bill and, once enacted, the Bill will override any State or Territory Act or regulation that is inconsistent with the principles of mutual recognition set out in the Bill. This is achieved through section 109 of the Constitution which provides that a Commonwealth Act prevails over State Acts to the extent of the inconsistency.

         The Bill provides for two models of recognition: one for goods and another for occupations. In the spirit of cooperative federalism and mutual recognition, I believe that there is scope to extend mutual recognition to other parts of the Australian economy. This is a start, and it is one that we welcome. By no means should we think that mutual recognition finishes with goods and occupations. I believe that, in many other areas where there are differing regulations, the principle of mutual recognition can be extended.

         Indeed, the concept of mutual recognition may be one of the great new concepts of federalism—the idea that under referrals of powers the Commonwealth can act in the area or, indeed, without referrals of powers where the States can enact for themselves mutual recognition and thereby assume compatibility and harmonisation between the different requirements. I think as we move into the next century the idea and the object of renewing federalism could be greatly advantaged by the idea of mutual recognition.

         Of course, the idea of cooperative federalism, new federalism, was very much a pioneering work of the Greiner Government. I pay tribute to the former Premier of New South Wales, to Gary Sturgess and to others who were part of it. Indeed, the last Prime Minister, Mr Hawke, was very much part of the move towards cooperative federalism before his untimely demise at the hands of the current Prime Minister (Mr Keating), who is not nearly as committed to the process of federalism through the venue of the Special Premiers Conference.

         Part 2 of the Bill implements the goods model. Essentially, it provides that Australian producers who comply with the laws in their place of production will be free to distribute and sell their products throughout Australia without the need to comply with the regulatory standards in other States or Territories. Similarly, goods imported from overseas which meet the standards of the importing State or Territory may be sold without restriction throughout Australia. Interstate goods which do not comply with the standards of the State in which they are being sold will be required to identify their State of origin. This is a minimum requirement to give consumers an opportunity to seek further information as a basis for making more informed trade-offs between quality and price.

         Mutual recognition will operate as a defence for anyone prosecuted in one jurisdiction for breaching a law which has the effect of prohibiting the sale of a product which was produced in accordance with the standards and regulations of the jurisdiction in which it was produced or into which it was imported. State and Territory governments will be permitted to enact temporary laws exempting a good from the scheme where there is a genuine risk to the health or safety of their citizens, or a real threat of pollution. During the life of that legislation, up to 12 months, the States and Territories will have the time to negotiate an agreed standard to deal with the problem, if considered necessary. But if agreement is not reached, mutual recognition will apply when the relevant law expires, and the sale of the goods will be permitted.

         In addition, mutual recognition will not apply to certain products for which a national market is not considered to be appropriate. These include firearms, gaming machines and pornographic material. Mr Deputy Speaker, you will be aware that, much to its shame, Canberra has become the porn and X-rated video capital of Australia. The Federal coalition will take the decision, which this Government will not take: to ban the export of X-rated videos and the production of X-rated videos in the Australian Capital Territory. We would not want to see a Bill like this allow something that can be done in the Australian Capital Territory to be mutually recognised by other States. Indeed, the Bill will not allow that because it specifically excludes pornographic material.

         There will, undoubtedly, be cases where the application of the mutual recognition principle will have undesirable results. I suppose the worst case scenario is mutual recognition resulting in lowest common denominator standards. One could think of innumerable examples where this could actually happen. But if it should be the case that a particular State has a standard that is lower than the national average, and advantage is taken of that, I believe it is proper that the matter should be addressed in discussions between the States. I am sure that the States concerned would be able to make that point felt, and I am sure that they would be able to bring suasion to bear on the particular government concerned.

The fact is that, when it comes to occupations and when it comes to goods, we are Australians.

         Now I come to the question of occupations. Part 3 of the Bill implements the occupation model. It essentially provides that, if a person is registered to carry out an occupation in one State or Territory, then he or she will be able to be registered and carry on the equivalent occupation in another State or Territory. The rationale is that, if someone is good enough to practise a profession or occupation in one State or Territory, then he or she should be able to do so anywhere in Australia. Essentially, all jurisdictions will rely on the place of first registration to properly assess that person.

         A person who wishes to commence work in another State will be required to lodge written notice with the local registration authority seeking registration in an equivalent occupation. Once such notice has been lodged, the person will be entitled to commence work. Registration must be granted within one month of lodgment of the notification unless the local registration authority is of the view that a statement or information in the notice or documentary evidence or information provided as to existing registration is materially false or misleading or that the registration sought is not for an equivalent occupation and equivalence cannot be achieved by imposing conditions. The Commonwealth Administrative Appeals Tribunal will hear appeals against decisions of local registration authorities and will have the power to declare an occupation to be non-equivalent. The States and Territories have agreed to vesting the AAT with this additional jurisdiction.

         Mutual registration is an outstanding example of what can be achieved when all governments in Australia cooperate and work together in the national interest. The Opposition firmly believes that it is essential to the efficient functioning of the national economy and of the Federal system that governments at all levels in Australia continue to foster and promote important developments such as mutual recognition. An important feature of this scheme is that it highlights the constructive use which can be made of section 51, placitum (xxxvii) of the Commonwealth Constitution. That provision allows the States to refer to the Commonwealth power to legislate in respect of matters normally outside its control.

         The provision could be put to great use in many other areas. It may, for example, be possible for a cooperative federalism to extend the reach of the Trade Practices Act, something that I have always been very interested in. The Trade Practices Act at the moment regulates competition in respect of corporations. State government business enterprises fall outside its ordinary scope. There is no reason why they should. If a business is conducted through a partnership, it can fall outside the scope. If it is conducted by an individual or sole trader, it can fall outside the scope. I believe that the rules on competition should apply uniformly as far as possible and, with cooperation from the States, it would be a major advance if that could be done across the national economy—just as the competition rules of the Trade Practices Act ought to apply, and apply even-handedly, to trade unions.

         —I am pleased to rise to speak in this debate because I believe that the Mutual Recognition Bill is a very important Bill and is yet another example of a growing healthy cooperation between the States, Territories and the Commonwealth, which demonstrates a maturity of government that bodes well for the future of Australia. We do not talk about depression on this side of the House; we talk about growth. The only depression we are aware of is that which emanates from beneath the closed doors of those opposite as they lie on couches late at night trying to figure out what strange quirk of fate has led them to yet again snatch defeat from the jaws of victory.

         The object of this Bill is to enable the enactment of legislation applying uniformly throughout Australia for the mutual recognition by the States and Territories of each other's differing regulatory standards regarding goods and occupations. Until recently, we had the ridiculous situation where throughout Australia we had three different definitions of bread. We had one instance in Western Australia where margarine had to be sold in cube tubs so as to force manufacturers to provide a special run of tubs for that State alone.

         In occupations, State registration requirements prevent professionals, even those graduating from Australian universities, and skilled tradesmen with extensive on-the-job experience, practising their skills in another State. These are situations that have to be remedied, but care also has to be taken that mutual recognition does not lead to a lowering of standards. This was referred to by the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) in his contribution.

         There is no doubt that the different, often contradictory, regulatory systems of the different governments of Australia cause major inefficiencies and restrictions on interstate trade, restrictions on the mobility of labour and restrictions on Australia's ability to compete internationally. In October 1990, heads of government agreed in principle to work towards implementing a scheme of mutual recognition, and further agreement was reached on 30 July 1991. Following a period of public consultation, Premiers and Chief Ministers at their meeting in Adelaide in November 1991 agreed on draft legislation to implement this scheme and at their meeting on 11 May 1992, heads of government signed a final agreement. It was agreed that the legislation would be enacted in each State and Territory by 31 October 1992 and by the Commonwealth by 1 January 1993, with the proclamation of the Commonwealth Act by no later than 1 March 1993.

         Mutual recognition is a pragmatic but workable response to the difficulties inherent in forging an agreement between all States and Territories. While mutual recognition ensures that goods legally produced for sale in one State of Australia can be sold in all States, temporary restrictions can be imposed for health and safety reasons or to preserve the environment. There will be two classes of permanent exemptions under mutual recognition relating to inherently dangerous and offensive goods and to certain laws protecting public health, the environment and laws on pornography.

         Mutual recognition also ensures that persons who are registered to practise their occupation in one State of Australia can, on notification of that registration, practise immediately in all other States. A local registration body will be set up which has one month to confirm or refuse registration. The refusal to register invokes a right to appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal which, depending on the number of appeals, may have to be further resourced.

         This Bill obviously has my full support, but I do have one concern. I know that the Government is aware that several professional groups have expressed concerns about mutual recognition. They argue that if the purpose of the legislation is to provide long term benefits to the public, then care must be taken to ensure that these benefits are not lost in the implementation process in so much as overall standards may be reduced to those of the State with the existing lowest standards.

         In my own area of expertise—namely, the law—I am aware that the Queensland and New South Wales law societies, which pride themselves on high standards of practical training, are forever concerned that the standards are still not high enough. If the floodgates are opened, there is a genuine fear in Queensland and New South Wales that the level of service provided to the client might be lowered via the influx of lawyers from other States and Territories who have been subjected to less rigorous training.

         There is an enormous oversupply of lawyers in Australia. We currently have some 25,000 solicitors and somewhere between 19,000 and 27,000 students who are studying law. We now have some 23 law schools—too many in my view—some of which promise jobs to potential students which they know full well are not there. I know the Government is aware of this concern, but I urge the ministerial councils that will be involved in this process to monitor the operation carefully.

         the President of the Law Society, Mr George Fox, came out with a press statement in which he talked about this oversupply of lawyers in Queensland. As you would appreciate, Mr Deputy Speaker, Queensland is the go-ahead State. It is the State with the lowest unemployment and the State to which everybody wants to move. That being the case, every sort of profession wants to come there.

        For that reason we need to be careful that we do not lower standards to the point where we have too many of one profession perhaps in one State. The Law Society in New South Wales, for example, has made it plain that it is concerned that aspects of this Bill will prevent the Law Society imposing any of its current post-admission requirements on any interstate applicant who holds an unregistered practising certificate in his or her first State of registration. These issues will have to be, and I am sure will be, resolved. There will obviously be hiccups in the bedding down of this legislation; even the best of marriages have rocky periods of adjustment. But there is no doubt that the legislation overall is a very good and long overdue idea.

         Under part IV of the agreement on mutual recognition there are provisions for national uniform standards, including national competency standards, to be determined by the appropriate ministerial council. This process will be vitally important. Upon the making of a determination the ministerial council, or ministerial councils jointly, as the case may be, will recommend to the heads of government of the participating parties that the standard or standards as determined shall be adopted. Unless this recommendation is disapproved by one-third or more of the heads of government or the participating parties within three months of its submission to those heads of government, the participating parties will take action, as soon as practicable, to implement the recommendation.

         Even though there are concerns from some quarters in regard to standards, mechanisms have been set in place for these concerns to be aired. I hope that these mechanisms are sufficient. I will be watching their progress with a great deal of interest. Importantly, the method of achieving mutual recognition has been achieved through a reference of power by the States to the Commonwealth. This has the advantage of demonstrating the commitment of all parties to the establishment of a national market. As the honourable member for Higgins said, the fact is that we are all Australians. It is pretty ridiculous to think that one needs to be registered. For instance, as a solicitor one has to be registered in a State to practise in it. I know that there are solicitors in Tweed Heads who can handle Queensland matters only if they are admitted in both States. It is just a way of getting a bit of extra dough for some of the State governments.

         During the consultation process of the mutual recognition agreement there was a significant number of submissions which did not support mutual recognition but which considered that the objective should be national uniformity. Time does not permit me to continue my remarks much longer. Suffice to say that there is broad agreement by the Federal Government and the State governments on this Bill. Possibly, it is something which should have been done a long time ago. I am glad it is happening. As I said previously, I am a little concerned, as are the legal bodies in New South Wales and Queensland, that it could lead to a lowering of standards. I hope it will not. I am sure that the ministerial council will be watching that with great interest. I commend the Bill to the House.

         —In the couple of minutes before we run out of time on the Mutual Recognition Bill 1992, I would like to make a couple of comments. I thank the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) and the honourable member for Bowman (Mr Sciacca) for their contributions. The honourable member for Higgins suggested that this principle could be extended beyond the goods and occupations covered in the Bill to other matters. Obviously, these are matters for consideration by future Premiers Conferences. They may well decide, in light of their experience of mutual recognition in this Bill, to proceed. But, given the difficulties that the States have in agreeing on common public holidays or daylight saving, for example, I am not terribly hopeful.

         —The Income Tax Assessment Amendment (Foreign Investment) Bill 1992 is the last Bill under guillotine this week. I think it is about the seventieth Bill which has been dealt with by this House this week. It implements the Government's 1991-92 Budget announcement to complete the third element of its tax reform agenda to develop a comprehensive system for taxing foreign source income.

         The first element of this agenda was the foreign tax credit system which, from the 1987-88 income year, replaced the general exemption in Australia of income earned offshore and subjected to foreign tax. The second element was the introduction of the foreign source income measures which took effect from the 1990-91 income year. The foreign source income measures apply where Australian residents have substantial interests in controlled foreign companies or had transferred property to certain foreign trusts for less than full value. They address the tax referral problem where these entities are used to shelter income from Australian tax by accumulating it in low tax or tax free jurisdictions. Such income is now taxed as it accrues.

         The foreign investment fund measures will apply to income and gains accumulating in foreign countries that are not Australian controlled or foreign trusts that fall outside the scope of the FSI measures. The measures will also apply to certain foreign life assurance policies that have an investment component such as life bonds. In addition, the Bill will amend the existing trust provisions in divisions 6 and 6AAA of the principal Act in their application to non-resident trust income. The principal change is to the way in which a person's share of the net income from such non-resident trusts is ascertained. This will be aligned in a way in which a person's share of foreign investment fund income is determined under the foreign investment fund measures.

         The Bill, therefore, is the Government's third major piece of legislation in its program to reform the taxation of foreign source income. This revised Bill contains the necessary new provisions for inclusion in the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 to give effect to the Government's approach in relation to the taxation of foreign investment funds. The foreign investment fund measures contained in this Bill will take effect on and from 1 January 1993.

         By way of background, the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services and Minister Assisting the Treasurer (Mr Baldwin) said in his second reading speech that the need for these measures, as well as the foreign tax credit system introduced in 1987 and the foreign source income measures introduced in 1991, arose from a tax system that was heavily biased in favour of investments in low tax countries. The system also encouraged Australians to source artificially profits in offshore tax havens and, in cases where Australians could control the distribution policy of a foreign entity, to defer remittance of profits.

         The foreign tax credit system which has operated since the 1987-88 income year replaced the system that gave a general exemption from Australian tax to income that was earned offshore that had been subject to foreign tax, regardless of the amount of tax paid. The foreign tax credit system provides generally for foreign income to be subject to Australian tax, with a credit being allowed for any foreign tax paid. The foreign source income measures which took effect in the 1990-91 income year introduced an accruals system of taxing foreign source income. The accruals taxation element of this legislation is directed at passive income and other forms of tainted income that is derived in low tax countries by Australian controlled foreign companies and accumulated offshore, avoiding Australian tax. It also applies to certain non-resident trusts to which Australians have transferred property or services for less than full value.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The Bill therefore introduces legislation which seeks to counter avoidance opportunities remaining after the introduction of the foreign source income measures. These are the cases where a foreign company or trust, although not generally controlled by Australians, is nevertheless an attractive investment vehicle because it allows for the accumulation of income offshore, especially in low-taxed countries, allowing the investor to minimise and defer Australian tax.

         This Bill in its first form was introduced earlier this year and, following general concerns that were raised by the industry, it was then referred off for a matter of consultancy to a Professor Brian Arnold of the University of Western Ontario in Canada. Professor Arnold is a well-known and respected expert in the field of international tax law. Subsequent to that referral, a series of recommendations and submissions were made to Professor Arnold's review by various interests and various persons interested in the subject of this particular legislation. Following Professor Arnold's review, the Bill was reintroduced by the Government on 3 November this year as an amended version of a Bill of the same name that was introduced on 25 June of this year. The passage of the 25 June Bill was delayed to provide interested parties with the opportunity to examine the proposed legislation and for further consultation.

         Subsequent to the review conducted by Professor Arnold, the Government, by adopting 37 of the 52 recommendations made by Professor Arnold, feels that it has solved the majority of the problems that were raised by the industry and by those with a concern about this legislation. However, there are still several problems associated with this legislation, some of which were the subject of recommendations by Professor Arnold in his review and not adopted by the Government, and some others which were beyond the purview of the recommendations and the review conducted by Professor Arnold.

         It should be noted, though, that Professor Arnold's report dealt only with the technical and practical aspects of the implementation of foreign investment funds legislation and not with the policy basis of the FIF legislation. For example, a number of those concerned about this legislation note that some of the major problems have been alleviated by this amended Bill, but generally these problems are of the Government's own making. The new Bill does not examine the fundamental concerns. The Taxation Institute of Australia, for example, has expressed the view that the proposed legislation has been introduced on the basis of an anti-avoidance and anti-tax deferral measure, but notes that the proposed legislation sets out an entire new regime for taxing investments in foreign entities generally and the anti-avoidance objective does not seem to justify the scope of these provisions. This is evident from the fact that the major burden of the proposed legislation will fall on Australian taxpayers with bona fide investments in offshore entities.

         The present Bill has made concessions in this area, though not far enough. The Taxation Institute, for example, notes that the proposed changes to the foreign life policies is only an alternative method of valuing income by referring to the sum value of the policy. All this alternative does is effectively tax the contribution at the top marginal rate.

         Many of the original concerns which have been expressed about this Bill have been addressed by the redrafted version. Importantly, the schedule 4 so-called `white list' has been replaced by a new `black list'. Conceptually, this is far easier since it now means that a taxpayer merely has to establish that a foreign investment fund is not principally engaged in the activities listed therein. This is a far simpler exercise than having to establish, as was required under the previous version of this Bill, that the FIF has principally engaged in listed acceptable activities.

         The exemption for an interest held in a foreign bank has been amended so that the test is now more practically feasible. Now, instead of the taxpayer having to establish the existence of a fixed number of non-associated shareholders, the interest will be exempt so long as the shares in the foreign bank are widely held and actively traded. The treatment of foreign investment fund losses has also been addressed—and this is welcomed by those who are involved in this particular area of activity—as recommended by Professor Arnold, to allow the foreign investment fund losses to be offset against a taxpayer's assessable income generally. However, there still remain serious concerns regarding the rationale behind the proposed legislation. The Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services and Minister Assisting the Treasurer, when dealing with the purpose of the Bill in his second reading speech, said:

       </para>
       <para>
        With the large number of exemptions now contained within this new Bill, its purpose is even more obviously aimed at avoidance and deferral of taxation. It is submitted that this stated objective could well have been achieved by a greater reliance on the present general anti-avoidance provision contained in part IVA of the Income Tax Assessment Act of 1936. The need to enact 113 pages of legislation in an attempt to bring into the tax net a very small proportion of the tax paying community already covered would appear to be legislative overkill at its very worst. The enactment of such a complex piece of legislation which taxpayers will theoretically have to acquaint themselves with simply to determine whether their investments are excluded from the operation of the foreign investment funds measures does not sit comfortably with the concept of simplification of the tax law.

         One of the principal objectives of taxation laws should be that they are certain in the first place and that they are easily ascertainable by ordinary taxpayers in Australia. If honourable members believe that this measure, these 113 pages are easily ascertainable by ordinary taxpayers in Australia, let me quote from just one clause of this Bill which is before the house tonight. Clause 15, which I will quote from—and there are other clauses which I could have easily quoted from—deals with proposed new section 160AFCF.(2)—not 160A, nor 160AF, not even 160AFC, but 160AFCF.(2).

         I now turn to some of the intricacies of this legislation which demand some dealing with tonight. The Government has not supported Professor Arnold's recommendations with regard to foreign life assurance policies. It has been submitted by a number of people to Professor Arnold, and to the Treasury, that the legislation will have a devastating consequence for longstanding retirement plans of migrants to Australia and expatriates returning to this country. The Bill has not adopted Professor Arnold's recommendations to transfer offshore policies onshore. Industry suggested that, when foreign life policies are transferred onshore, they should not need to restart a 10-year period for the purposes of section 26A(H) of the Income Tax Assessment Act.

         The foreign investment funds regime does not apply to non-residents. But when immigrants and returning Australian expatriates become residents of Australia, their foreign life assurance policies become foreign investment funds, taxed annually in cash on unrealised gains. In comparison with Australian offshore arrangements, the most that the Commissioner of Taxation is entitled to receive is tax on the internal growth of the foreign life policy after the non-resident becomes a resident.

         As the legislation stands, residents with foreign life policies will be liable for foreign investment funds tax, in cash, on growth that has not yet been realised. Inevitably, the consequence of this legislation will be to drive foreign life policies underground. I have already heard of stories in places such as Hong Kong where expatriates are being advised that there are ways to avoid this legislation. If we have a situation where legislation is about to be introduced into the Australian Parliament and is about to become part of the law of taxation in this country, yet overseas Australian expatriates and people who are likely to migrate to this country are already being advised, and we are being told that they are being advised, that there are ways of avoiding this legislation by driving these schemes underground, then the whole purpose of the legislation is being avoided and this measure is of very little consequence.

         —There is no commonsense in it, as my learned friend says. The foreign investment fund measures will yield 48.4c on any resident's foreign life policies that the Australian Taxation Office can locate, anywhere in the world. The alternative is to allow these policies to be transferred onshore. From the time the policyholder becomes resident, the transferred policy will no longer be a foreign investment fund and the resident policyholder will not be liable to FIF tax. Instead, 39c will be paid at source on the growth of the underlying investment.

         There are three reasons why transfers onshore ought to be permitted: first, it is a sensible solution which gives taxpayers the space in which to comply with the tax laws of this country; secondly, there is equity with resident Australian policyholders, whose growth is taxed at 39c at source; and, thirdly, the proposal will yield more revenue than the existing FIF measures. Tax at 39c at source in Australia is worth more than tax at 48.4c wherever in the world the Australian Taxation Office can locate the policies of residents. Of course, to provide the incentive for transfer onshore, the 10-year clock needs to run from the commencement date of the original foreign life policy. Of course, Professor Arnold's recommendation is not provided for in this policy.

         There are a series of problems in the legislation which I should flag in the debate tonight.

         The first is that the implementation date of this Bill should be delayed, we believe, until 1 July 1993. This would allow sufficient time to design and implement detailed systems to capture and record the information necessary to comply with the foreign investment fund legislation, which requires many months to implement. The delay in the introduction of the Bill will also assist taxpayers who have substituted accounting periods in lieu of the succeeding 30 June. Furthermore, it is significantly cheaper to implement a computer system change at the beginning of a financial year rather than halfway through the financial year. In relation to the implementation date of this legislation, I foreshadow that the coalition in the other place proposes that the commencement date be delayed from 1 January 1993 to 1 July 1993.

         Secondly, the double taxation of income from interest in non-resident trust estates still exists where the foreign investment fund is sold during the year of income.

         Thirdly, there is a fundamental problem with the treatment of financial services. A series of companies—for example, American Express, Merrill Lynch and Salomon Inc.—are included in the Morgan Stanley capital index in the financial services category. There is no exemption in the Bill for legitimate investments in such companies, which is of concern since these investments often constitute 20 per cent of a foreign investment portfolio. Therefore, we believe that financial services should be exempt where the shares are listed on the approved exchange widely held and actively traded.

         Fourthly, the balance sheet method is an impractical method to apply and assume that the taxpayer has access to detailed information. The annual set of accounts do not always provide sufficient information on the percentage of assets used relating to ineligible activities. Proposed section 500 provides that, under the balance sheet method, only 50 per cent or more owned subsidiaries of a holding company will be taken into account when applying the designated activities exemption. It is arguable that the consolidated balance sheet method of determining whether the active business exemption applies should include subsidiaries where there is a less than 50 per cent ownership, but where the holding company is actively involved in the management of the subsidiary, particularly in respect of joint venture companies. This may be limited to cases where the accounts clearly show that the holding company treats the investment in the less than 50 per cent subsidiary as an associated company or joint venture interest.

         The exclusion in proposed section 500(3)(b) of the `gross value of the shares in the subsidiary company owned by the holding company' from the calculations involved in applying the balance sheet method, appears to only effectively operate to exclude the effect of the shares held by the holding company in a first tier subsidiary. It should be noted in this regard that the gross value of subsidiary assets to be applied in the formula is defined as `the gross value at the test time of all the subsidiary company's assets' which would thus include the shares in a second tier subsidiary held by a first tier subsidiary. To be consistent, that definition should exclude the value of any shares which such subsidiary holds in any other company which is also a subsidiary of the holding company.

         In addition to that, proposed subsection 500(6) and proposed section 501 provide the mechanism for: firstly, determining whether a company is a subsidiary of a holding company; and, secondly, calculating what proportion of a subsidiary's assets should be taken into account in applying the balance sheet formula. It is arguable that while the mechanism is appropriate in determining the answer to the second point, it is not appropriate for determining whether a company is a subsidiary of the holding company for the purposes of applying the balance sheet method of active business exemption.

         , where it is stated that the basis for determining whether a company is a subsidiary of a holding company is to be determined solely upon the criterion of control. It would seem appropriate that a separate test be inserted for determining whether a company is a subsidiary of a holding company, using similar rules to those used in part X of the Assessment Act to determine whether a company is a controlled foreign company.

         It would follow that, where a holding company owns more than 50 per cent of the issued share capital of a subsidiary—that is, the first subsidiary—in determining the holding company's interest in a company which is in turn a subsidiary—that is, the second subsidiary—of the first subsidiary, the whole amount of the first subsidiary's interest in the second subsidiary should be attributed to the parent company. Where less than 50 per cent interest was held by the holding company in the first subsidiary, the holding company's interest in the second subsidiary would be calculated as in proposed section 501, by multiplying the holding company's percentage interest in the first subsidiary by the first subsidiary's percentage interest in the second subsidiary. If anybody listening to this debate who does not have a degree in taxation law can understand what I am talking about, I suspect he or she is in the top 0.001 per cent of the Australian population.

Under any accepted accounting standard, and any other control test in the Assessment Act, the holding company would be taken to control the second subsidiary; but, applying the tests set out in proposed section 501, the holding company will be taken to have a 49 per cent interest in the second subsidiary, and the assets of the second subsidiary will thus not be taken into account in applying the active business exemption. However, the shares held by the first subsidiary in the second subsidiary and any advances by the holding company to the second subsidiary will probably be included as assets, not for use in designated activities in applying the balance sheet test to holding companies.

         I could probably continue with problems associated with the balance sheet test in this proposed legislation for the next hour, but it seems to me that what I have been saying illustrates clearly not only the complexities of this legislation but also the real problems that have been isolated and identified by those who will be subject to the legislation. The fifth problem is that the life insurance exemption can be satisfied only by using the balance sheet method. Sixthly, the Morgan Stanley Capital Index does not differentiate between companies carrying on life insurance and those with general insurance businesses. Rather, there is only one classification of insurance. Hence, a taxpayer would have to use the balance sheet method to determine whether the foreign investment fund was exempt.

         Seventhly, the trading stock exemption in proposed section 520 implies that all foreign investment funds have to be valued at market value under proposed section 31(5) for the foreign investment funds to be exempt. The exemption should be amended so that a taxpayer can elect to use the market value method under proposed section 31(5) in respect of a particular foreign investment fund to ensure that the foreign investment fund provisions do not apply. Eighthly, there is an argument for the introduction of a deemed disposal election similar to the amendments made to trading stock provisions for foreign investment funds held on capital and revenue account. This would significantly reduce compliance costs and would be used only where the 5 per cent exemption is not satisfied.

         Ninthly, the exemption for multi-industries and conglomerates assumes that the taxpayer has sufficient information to satisfy the conditions in proposed section 523. This can be done only through the balance sheet method, because, for example, the Morgan Stanley Capital Index classifies these entities under `multi-industry'. Tenthly, the 5 per cent exemption should be amended to reflect 5 per cent of a total portfolio of assets held. The eleventh problem is that the adoption of a black-listed approach does not reduce the level of compliance and administrative work, since attribution accounts will still have to be maintained. In this regard, the compliance costs will not differ significantly because detailed systems will have to be designed and implemented to comply with the legislation for many clients.

         Twelfthly, the use of an index to determine the international sectoral classification requires further consideration.

Finally, the compliance issues identified by Professor Arnold have not been resolved. Costly systems have to be maintained to produce multiple sets of accounts for a particular foreign investment fund to enable unit holders to be provided with the correct tax information.

There are considerable problems in relation to the whole concept and in achieving the objectives that have been sought by the Government.

         —I would like briefly to address one or two issues raised by the honourable member for Menzies (Mr Andrews) in respect of the Income Tax Assessment Amendment (Foreign Investment) Bill. I think it is important to point out to the honourable gentleman, as he rightly did chronicle, that there were considerable consultations undertaken by the Government in respect  of  this  present  legislation  and other legislation which was the forerunner to it.

         After the measures were first foreshadowed in April 1989, there was also a Budget announcement in August 1991 and further consultation after the release of a detailed information paper in April 1992. As the honourable member spent some considerable time indicating, there was further consultation in the form of an independent international expert, Professor Arnold, who brought down a report for the Government and, after the Bill was originally introduced in June 1992, made some recommendations to it. As has been pointed out, a number of those recommendations were acted upon.

         The honourable member for Menzies has pointed out where he believes there are some shortcomings. One point that he made which I think is worthy of clarification is that Professor Arnold said that there was no need to provide for the transfer of foreign life policies onshore if a market value method of taxation was provided. The Government adopted that recommendation to provide a market value method of taxation, so one of the issues which he pointed to has been addressed.

         The other issue of significance which the honourable member went to was the complexity of the legislation and its sheer bulk. He asked, `Why is this Bill necessary? Why is it so complex?'. I guess the answer to that comes from the fact that had he been here in the mid-1980s to see what the spivs and the failed entrepreneurs of the 1980s were doing in terms of the taxation system of this country, and to see the way in which tax havens in places such as the Cook Islands and other islands in the Caribbean were being used to get around the tax system of this country, he might understand why legislation of this nature has of necessity to be as complex as it is.

By employing the smart lawyers and the smart accountants, people were able to devise methods whereby, by setting up a shingle outside a hut in some of these faraway places with exotic names, they were able to route through the paperchase many millions of dollars and have it rerouted back into Australia through a variety of complex devices, and no tax was paid.

         I might say to the honourable gentleman that this particular issue was the subject of two parliamentary inquiries in this Parliament. It led in part to the Government crackdown and the introduction of the legislation, this being the third part of that major legislation dealing with these issues. Some of the major corporations in the 1980s were singled out as being tremendous for Australia and doing the right thing, such as the Bond Corporation. But when we went to their annual report to see where most of their subsidies were incorporated, we found it was the Cook Islands or the Netherlands Antilles, and all those sorts of places. We had to scratch our heads and say, `What is it about these particular locations that make it attractive for multimillion dollars to be routed through them?'. The answer was, of course, that they had negligible tax; in fact, most of them had none. They had secrecy provisions so that the Australian Taxation Office could not get information on those companies. It simply came down to the fact that there were no tax treaties between the countries concerned and Australia, so it was impossible to trace the paper and money trails.

         Other countries around the world have legislation of the sort that we are introducing tonight. I think it is fair that avoidance of fair and reasonable contributions by all taxpayers in this country should be eliminated. I think it is not fair simply to complain about the complexity of the legislation on one hand, and then to say that there were also some complaints about rorts that were invented offshore to get around the provisions which people were talking about. One of the unfortunate facts facing the Australian Taxation Office is that, as legislation is drafted to meet the needs of present circumstances, is debated in parliament and subsequently becomes law, there is always some smart spiv lawyer or accountant trying to be one step ahead of it and trying to work out ways in which it can be rorted.

One day we were actually getting a briefing from some people from the Australian Taxation Office who were drafting the legislation to meet its needs and the next week we found out that he had been snaffled by Bond Corporation to work with it and to give it advice on how to do it. It is a bit difficult, then, to say that on one hand it has to be complex and on the other hand say there are people who are trying to rort the system to get around it.

         The legislation is timely. It has come through extensive consultation with the industry and with other people. The various recommendations, which were made by a noted international lawyer, were in the main picked up. But the Government always has the right to review its own legislation and to put in place what it believes is going to meet the needs of the day. This clearly does that, and I commend the Bill to the House.

        In view of the hour, and the fact that this Bill was passed in the Senate without amendment, I do not propose to read the prepared speech. I refer honourable members to the speech of the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Senator McMullan) when introducing the Bill into the Senate on 16 September 1992. In summary, the Bill proposes amendments to a number of Acts dealing with Commonwealth criminal law. These amendments will enhance the effectiveness of legislation central to the fight against organised crime and serious fraud. I commend the Bill to the House and present the related explanatory memorandum.
