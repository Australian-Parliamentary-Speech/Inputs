        —It is with great honour that I rise to nominate the honourable member for Henty (Mrs Child) for the position of Speaker. The honourable member for Henty has earned the great respect of everyone in this House since she was first elected to the Parliament. That election was the 1974 Federal election. Indeed, through that election Joan Child became the first Australian Labor Party woman to be elected to the House of Representatives. Until that time the seat of Henty had been held by the Liberal Party. In fact, Mr Max Fox, until his defeat in 1974, had held the seat for some 19 years. So one can see that to win Henty in the first place was in itself no mean feat.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       Joan lost in the 1975 landslide against the Whitlam Government. However, not to be denied, she stood again in 1977 and 1980 when she won back the seat of Henty. She has, of course, won the seat twice more since then. It is indeed a mark of the great respect Joan's constituents have for her that she has swung Henty from a 9.4 per cent Liberal majority in the early 1970s to a 7.3 per cent majority for herself and the Labor Party today. Starting in 1972, therefore, Joan Child has fought the last seven successive Federal elections. However, notwithstanding what I have already said, it is Joan Child the woman, Joan Child a community worker over a lifetime and above all Joan Child the person who is respected by everyone who comes into contact with her.
      </para>
      <para>
       Since her return to Melbourne from Tasmania in the mid-1960s after the tragic death of her husband, Hal, Joan has not only brought up five rather large sons whom, I may add, hover around rather menacingly if anyone dares to be nasty to their mother, but also she has been involved in many community activities, helping many individuals and families through the health or social security system or some other community assistance. It is this great work over more than two decades that has made Joan a household name in the south-eastern suburbs of Melbourne and it has also been the hallmark of a person concerned for others. Her compassion for her fellow human beings is unsurpassed.
      </para>
      <para>
       However, Joan has also earned great respect for her hard work, reliability and diligence in her electorate and in the Parliament. Her tough-minded attitude on issues in which she genuinely believes has been a thorn in the side of many Ministers of governments of both persuasions over the last decade or so. It is, sir, precisely because of Joan's sure-mindedness and toughness when needs be and the respect that she has earned from everyone in this Parliament-I repeat `earned', because it is not lightly given-that have led to her great success as Deputy Speaker and Chairman of Committees during the last two years and I am sure will continue into the position of Speaker of the House.
      </para>
      <para>
       If I may, I would like to tell a little story before resuming my seat. Whilst enjoying a cup of tea and a friendly chat with Joan recently, which we are prone to do from time to time, I asked her whether, if I nominated her, I would receive any special privileges such as being able to interject more than usual. She leant across the table and in a very polite fashion-I think she has done this also to the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke)-and in a very firm manner said: `David, if you put one foot out of place, you will be the first one to go out the door'. As most honourable members would know, her interests are many and varied. They include her love for sport and leisure activities such as Australian Rules football, in respect of which she is a fanatical Hawthorn supporter. She is also a devoted cricket lover. I am sure that, if asked, Joan could give the Australian team a few helpful hints on how to win back the ashes next year.
      </para>
      <para>
       All in all, sir, I am sure that all honourable members can see that her many interests, which range right across the spectrum from her devotion to her family, her leisure activities, to her involvement in many major issues of significant economic importance in this country, including the very important subject of education on which she is one of the foremost experts in this Parliament, her compassion and concern for others and the respect she has earned in this Parliament as a member and as a Deputy Speaker in the last two years, makes the honourable member for Henty, Mrs Joan Child, the ideal choice for the position of Speaker of the House of Representatives.

        —Mr Clerk, I have much pleasure in nominating the honourable member for Curtin, Mr Rocher, as Speaker of this House. Mr Rocher was elected to the Senate for Western Australia in 1977. He has served there and in this House since then with very great distinction. He has had long experience on the committees of both Houses of the Parliament and that experience equips him perfectly well to take the high office of Speaker of this House. But he has other qualities in addition. Mr Speaker Snedden said once that the desirable qualities of Speaker-and we can check these off against the honourable member-were integrity, and he has that, judgment, common sense, patience, tact, a sense of humour, self-confidence, presence of mind and, most importantly, firmness tempered with kindness. Allan Rocher has all of those qualities in abundance. He will be a good Speaker of this House.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       Two other things must be said. The first is that Mrs Child has achieved a rare distinction. She was the only candidate for the Government Party's nomination for Speaker and she was elected unanimously. It should be said that any member who obtains the unanimous support of his or her party for election to high office must have the universal respect of that party. We appreciate and understand that. However, secondly, it must be said that whoever is elected as Speaker has the responsibility of upholding the rights of private members of this House. The test of that responsibility comes most sharply, we would suggest, at Question Time. We say that because during the last session of Parliament we were subjected to a series of long-winded sermons and lectures by Ministers under the guise of answering questions. The worst offender, of course, was the one who is already mumbling here now, namely, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke). His answers frequently went for 15 minutes or more. We know that the Prime Minister is a comparative newcomer to the Parliament and has not yet adapted to its conventions and practices. However, he should have learned by now.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Speaker, of course, is limited by the fact that there is no standing order which gives him power to require a Minister to conclude his answer to a question. But Mr Pettifer, who edited the House of Representatives Practice, has told us that the Speaker may exercise persuasion, may emphasise the need for answers to be brief and may also draw Ministers' attention to the fact that they can always make a statement after Question Time to avoid a lengthy answer.
      </para>
      <para>
       I ask honourable members opposite to stop mumbling for a minute and to listen. They might learn something and be better informed, even if no wiser. It should be of just as much concern to Government members as it is to Opposition members that the number of questions we are now able to ask is rapidly shrinking. In the last three years of the Fraser Government an average of 805 questions without notice were asked per year. In the three years of the Hawke Government, the figure has dropped from 805 questions per year to 607. That is a drop of 200 questions which were not able to be asked because of speeches made by Ministers under the guise of answering questions. Opposition members are concerned about this. We suggest that Government members should be equally concerned.
      </para>
      <para>
       In the same period the number of questions has dropped from 15 a day to 11, despite the fact that we now have an expanded Parliament and more members trying to ask questions. The view of the Opposition is that this simply has to stop. Members on the Government and the Opposition sides have a right to ask questions, and Ministers have an obligation to ensure that their answers are brief to enable as many questions as possible to be asked.
      </para>
      <para>
       The operation of this Parliament depends upon give and take. There must be common sense and fairness in Question Time. We ask Ministers, especially the Prime Minister, to show more of that commodity than we saw in the last session. Finally, we must say that if we do not see an improvement Ministers will simply have to learn the hard way. Co-operation is a two-way process. If we do not get co-operation from Ministers at Question Time, we will use every tactic open to an Opposition-let me remind honourable members opposite that there are plenty of them-to ensure that we do get a fair go. We have no doubt that Mr Rocher will show this concern for Government members, as he will for Opposition members. I am sure that Mrs Child would want to do the same for both sides of the House, but to do that she would need the co-operation of the front bench-all of the Ministers. We hope and trust that, whoever is elected speaker, that co-operation will be forthcoming. For the same reasons I have stated, I urge honourable members to vote for Mr Rocher.

        —After the gracious speech of the honourable member for Menzies (Mr N.A. Brown), I am privileged to second the nomination of the honourable member for Henty (Mrs Child) for the position of Speaker. This is indeed an historic occasion for this Parliament and for Australia, because it is the first time in Australia's history that a woman has had the opportunity to take the position of Speaker in the Federal Parliament.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       Making history is not new for Joan Child. In 1974, when she was elected to this Parliament, she was the first Australian Labor Party woman ever to sit in this chamber. Joan has always shied away from being stereotyped as the woman in the House. She made it clear when she was elected in 1974 that she was a politician who happened to be a woman. Inside and outside this chamber she has clearly shown an understanding of and support for the disadvantaged, the unemployed, the aged and the handicapped.
      </para>
      <para>
       When Joan is elected Speaker she will set a great example for the women of Australia. She has demonstrated that a woman from a very ordinary background, but with special qualities, can succeed. I challenge anyone in this House to name a person who has greater determination and single-mindedness than Joan Child. When she was widowed with five sons to bring up she made sure that their living standards were not disadvantaged because she was a widow. She made sure that they did not suffer any stigma as second-class citizens just because she did not have a husband. She set out determinedly to prove that a woman alone in the world could survive.
      </para>
      <para>
       She fought for three years to win the seat of Henty in 1974, and when she lost it in 1975 she worked assiduously for five years to win it back in 1980. In an interview in 1975 she stated determinedly `Henty is my seat and I am going to win it back' and that she did.
      </para>
      <para>
       As Chairman of Committees, Joan Child has demonstrated the same determination to get on top of the job and perform it with dignity and firmness. In the Australian Labor Party Federal Caucus there are no special favours because one is a woman. Joan has today received the nomination of the Australian Labor Party because she deserves it. Never underestimate Joan Child; she is a very formidable woman. She may smile benignly from the chair and demonstrate a lively sense of humour, but she has had years of experience in managing a family of males with firmness and with love. There is no doubt she will demonstrate that same firmness and balance in her new role. Joan is immensely loyal to her friends, but one has to earn that loyalty. There is no doubt that if one is her enemy one will know it. I think there are a few who could testify to that.
      </para>
      <para>
       I recall the early days of the sitting of the 1980 Parliament, when I was sitting next to Joan on the Opposition benches. I was a new recruit, and on the first day of sitting Charlie Jones, who had served long in this Parliament, came in and looked across the bench and saw that he had to sit next to Joan. He said at top note: `It is bad enough having you sheilas here, but I have to sit next to one of you'. I was slightly taken aback by that. However, it did not ruffle Joan. She simply turned around and said: `Sit down, Charles, and be quiet'. Of course, Charles meekly obliged, and he did not complain again.
      </para>
      <para>
       Joan Child will make at least one major change in this House. In February 1981, at the end of Question Time the honourable member for Henty asked the then Speaker whether he would cease referring to members as honourable gentlemen. `It is starting to get a bit embarrassing', she told the House. The Speaker acknowledged the error, apologised, and a minute later asked honourable gentlemen to resume their seats. Madam Speaker, I am sure, will never make that mistake. Today is not just a proud day for Joan's five sons and their families, who are here; it is a proud day for the Australian Labor Party and all her colleagues. She does us great credit by being our nominee for Speaker.

        —Mr Clerk, it is with a great deal of pleasure that I second the nomination of Mr Allan Charles Rocher, the honourable member for Curtin, as Speaker of the Parliament. I think we all need to understand that since the election of the Hawke Government the standards of this Parliament have declined significantly. There has been a constant attempt by members of the Government to denigrate the institution of Parliament. One need only look around at the standard of dress that so many members of the Australian Labor Party affect; to listen to the debate in this House and to the responses during Question Time by the man who very temporarily sits on the benches as Prime Minister; to see the degree to which he portrays an arrogance that shows little respect for the institution that is the Australian Parliament; to see the extent to which individual Ministers during Question Time are quite prepared not to do as they should-that is, to make parliamentary statements on matters of policy-but respond to Dorothy Dix questions, to know the degree to which this institution has been affected by the election of the Australian Labor Party.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       This election of Speaker is therefore particularly important. It is important not just for the quality of Parliament but also for the confidence of the electorate at large in this place as an institution. Honourable members will recall an article by Milton Cockburn in the Sydney Morning Herald of Tuesday, 8 October, only last year. In that article Mr Cockburn referred to the complaint that Parliament is a declining institution, and he quoted statistics from the latest annual report of the Department of the House of Representatives to prove that that was so. Honourable members might recall that the former Clerk of this Parliament, Mr Pettifer, in his House of Representatives Practice noted the attributes required of a person who is to be elected as Speaker of this place. He said:
      </para>
      <para>
       One of the hallmarks of good Speakership is the requirement for a high degree of impartiality in the execution of the duties.
      </para>
      <para>
       He refers to May's Parliamentary Practice when he states:
      </para>
      <para>
       Confidence in the impartiality of the Speaker is an indispensable condition of the successful working of procedure, and many conventions exist which have as their object not only to ensure the impartiality of the Speaker but also to ensure that his impartiality is generally recognised.
      </para>
      <para>
       Mr Pettifer continues:
      </para>
      <para>
       The Speaker shows impartiality in the Chamber above all else.
      </para>
      <para>
       That, I believe, is one of the attitudes we must look for in the person we are about to elect as Speaker. We respect Mrs Child as an individual and as a member. We respect her contribution as a parliamentarian. We compliment her on the fact that she is the first lady member to have been elected Chairman of Committees of this place. But, if one looks at the qualities required to dispense impartiality, one can only express regret with regard to an article in this morning's Age by Richard Guilliatt which states:
      </para>
      <para>
       Mrs Child does not share this reforming zeal.
      </para>
      <para>
       So be it. But she does say that she intends to attend party meetings and she does intend not to be an independent Speaker because, she says, there is no such animal. I put to Mrs Child that, while we respect very much the contribution she has made as a member and while we believe that she has so many admirable qualities, it is important that, having assumed the mantle of Speaker-inevitably, the numbers will give her that responsibility-she should consider the admonition that is quoted not only by Mr Pettifer in his House of Representatives Practice but also in May's Parliamentary Practice, which is ultimately binding in the application of the rules of this place. There is also the fact that the Standing Orders not only of this Parliament but also of the United Kingdom House of Commons and others, such as the House of Commons in Canada, give to the person who is Speaker a measure of independence that requires that speakers on this side of the House, be it in Question Time, private members' time or any of the other procedures of the Parliament, be given at least equal and fair consideration. We will be looking forward to that being exercised by the person who is elected Speaker.
      </para>
      <para>
       I believe that Allan Rocher, above all, is the person who has those qualities. He has been a senator. My colleague the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party has referred very fittingly to the description given by Speaker Snedden of the obligations of a Speaker. Mr Rocher enjoys them all. I therefore put to members of the Parliament that, in spite of party loyalties, it would be well for them to consider the necessity to ensure that there is impartiality and that we lift the standards of this Parliament. I submit to honourable members that the honourable member for Curtin is the one to whom the vote should be given and we look forward to all members of the House endorsing him as their choice.

        —I believe that the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) has qualities deserving of the position of Speaker because he, at least, will be a lasting Speaker. If we look at what has occurred over the last three years, we see that the intimidation of the previous Speaker by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) caused him to give the job away early. All members of this House will recall time and again the Prime Minister turning the ring on his finger, looking to the sky, almost demanding of the previous Speaker that he start to throw out members on this side of the House. I believe that Dr Jenkins made the decision that he would not put up with that intimidation and that it would be in the interests of the Parliament for him to accept the offer of a job in Madrid so that he would not follow down the same road taken by Jim Cope many years ago when he was summarily dismissed because he did not follow the dictates of the Government of the time.

      <para>
       I believe that Mr Rocher is a man of strength, a man who will not be intimidated-this is not meant as a complete reflection on the honourable member for Henty (Mrs Child)-a man who will say to the Prime Minister: `Be seated, because we have reached a stage when the number of questions has been reduced over the last three years and the standards of the Parliament are slipping away because of the way in which you expect me to act as though I were an instrument of Papa Doc or Baby Doc in Haiti'. That is the way the Prime Minister expects this Parliament to be run and that is why I am proposing that Mr Rocher, who is a man of strength, integrity and dignity-the word `strength' should be underlined three or four times-is the person most suitable to take the job.
      </para>
      <para>
       However, if he does not get the job I would like Mrs Child to understand that my contribution is not meant to be inflammatory and cause her to look upon me in an unfavourable way. In conclusion, I have a very high regard for the now departed from this place Dr Harry Jenkins. I am just sorry that he had to opt to get out because he could not stand the pressure of the Prime Minister.

        —Madam Speaker, all of us here today have been privileged to be part of history because we have participated in and been witness to this historic election of the first woman Speaker of this great House. Madam Speaker, it is both a great personal achievement and a strongly symbolic one. It is richly deserved. I assure you that you have the unqualified congratulations of the Government and, I know, of this House. For you, Madam Speaker, it is another step and indeed a highlight in a distinguished career which, as previous speakers have said, has seen you elected as the first Labor woman member of this House, the first woman Chairman of Committees and then ultimately, today, the first woman Speaker of the House.

       Madam Speaker, your new position reflects the esteem in which you are held by this House and is a measure of your integrity, ability and character. May I say that that is particularly reflected in the fact that in what is a tough sort of political apparatus on both this and the other side of this House you received the unanimous endorsement of your party. That speaks so highly of your character. There will be little doubt, if any, to any person in this House who knows you that you will discharge your duties with dignity and impartiality. It is a matter of pride on this side of the House that the last three years in this country have seen a considerable improvement in the recognition of the skills, abilities and aspirations of Australian women. Your election is a symbol of that recognition.

       Madam Speaker, as one who counts himself as a personal friend of yours of many years standing, I regard today's events as a just reward not only for your diligence, hard work and fairmindedness but also for the great qualities of a human being that you have brought to this House. It must be a matter of great pride to you that those five sons whom you have brought up are here today to witness this great event. I know that your life has not always been easy and I have no doubt that at times your role as Speaker will also be difficult. Nevertheless, may I assure you that you will at all times carry with you the best wishes of this House and our deep respect. We wish you well.

        —Of course, I dismiss the fanciful nonsense that comes, as we expect, from the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Donald Cameron). Harry Jenkins was a distinguished Speaker of this House. He was, without question, fair to both sides. There is no doubt that he preferred to settle any disputes that arose in our proceedings by the quick quip rather than by formality. He was respected by both sides of this House. Harry Jenkins had a long service in this Parliament after, as we all know, previous service in the Victorian Parliament. In his service in this House he not only brought great credit to this institution but also served the electors of Scullin well over all of that period. As he departed this place over the Christmas break, all of us did not have the opportunity to wish him a formal farewell. I wish now to place on record the gratitude of this side of the House for the role he played.

Despite the partisan nature of the ballot, I think I can say without equivocation that the pleasure of the historic nature of your election as the first woman Speaker of the House of Representative is shared equally on both sides of the House. It is a remarkable tribute to your career, courage, determination and hard work that, according to the political principles in which you believe, you have been able to battle your way to a position where you have been unanimously chosen by the Australian Labor Party as its nominee for the position of Speaker.

       You are a person well liked on both sides of the House. There have been occasions in the past when there have been inevitable disagreements with your rulings as Chairman of Committees and Deputy Speaker. But I know that you enjoy a considerable degree of respect and regard on our side of the House and we look forward to your period as Speaker of the House as being one marked by fairness, impartiality and a commitment to the parliamentary institution which, with all its faults and with all its detractors, is still the principal forum in which our democratic process is played out. While you maintain those principles you will have the great good will and the great support on our side of the House.

       I would like particularly to say to you, as the Prime Minister did, that it must be a great source of satisfaction to you personally to have all of the members of your family here today witnessing this very remarkable time in your career. So we wish you well. We look forward to your stewardship. We will follow it with great interest. We will give very great attention to your rulings. We know that you will take on board the very cogent arguments that were addressed by my colleague, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr N. A. Brown). The importance of this chamber as a debating place in which members on both sides of the House, not only those on the front bench, have the opportunity to have their say and to have their rights respected is something that all of us should very jealously guard. You assume the position as the first woman ever to become Speaker of the House of Representatives with the good wishes and the good will of the Opposition.

       I also join with the Prime Minister in wishing your predecessor, Dr Jenkins, well. Although what he will be doing is not officially announced, I wish him an interesting period ahead. Rumour hath it that he may be taking up some position. If that is true, he goes with the very good wishes of the Opposition. We had some differences, and I certainly do not want to get into a debate about that now. Harry Jenkins is no longer a member of the House, but I know that all members of the Opposition wish him and his wife the best of health, the best of good fortune and a very enjoyable period whatever may be their lot.

It is an occasion which adds dignity and honour to this chamber and to the parliamentary institution. As I said when seconding the nomination of Mr Rocher, we regard you highly as a member of this chamber.

       You now occupy a lonely position. It is one that calls on one's reserves of energy and strength.

You certainly have shown determination and strength in your assumption of this office, in your performance in this House, and in your representation of your electorate. I wish you well. I know that today your sons will be as proud of your achievement, as, I have little doubt, you have been of theirs. I wish you well in the exercise of your office.

       With regard to the former Speaker, Dr Harry Jenkins, and Wendy, his wife, I join with the remarks of the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard). Harry was a long time and distinguished parliamentarian in the Victorian Legislative Assembly and, subsequently, here. As Speaker we did not always see eye to eye with him, but Harry made a very important contribution towards establishing and maintaining the standards which are an important part of a democracy. For all that he may or may not take up another office, I know that, whatever he does, he will do it with distinction. I believe that in the past he has represented his country in an excellent fashion. To him and his wife, I wish long life and every success in whatever responsibilities he may be called on to bear. I know that all members of the House share these wishes with me.

       Madam Speaker, I am pleased to note that your accession to the Speakership has been far more agreeable to this House than apparently was Abercromby's accession in Disraeli's eyes.

       There are some dangers as well as duties and responsibilities that go with your high office, Madam Speaker. You may not know that Speaker Bussy, the last Speaker under Richard II, was one of the first to deem it his duty to serve only the King and to keep the Commons subservient. His loyalty was to the King and not to the Commons, but he paid for it because, when Henry IV deposed Richard, Speaker Bussy was beheaded without trial. I suspect, however, that any difficulties you may have will be of the type referred to by Speaker Selwyn Lloyd, who said in defence of holders of the Speaker's office:

Madam Speaker, my association with you over recent years, as one of your Deputy Chairmen of Committees and as a fellow delegate on a parliamentary delegation, leads me to believe that you will earn the goodwill and respect of the Opposition in your new high office.

I suppose the honourable member will bring me an apple next time.

        If I may, with the indulgence of the House I also thank Dr Jenkins, the previous Speaker, for a tremendous amount of assistance which he has given me in my term as Deputy Speaker.

       </para>
       <para>
        Having said that, I would like also to reply to a few things said during the speeches. Firstly I say to the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr M. A. Brown) that when he is getting irate about the length of time it takes for Ministers to answer questions he should remember that the remedy for this of course is in the hands of honourable members; it is not in the hands of the Chair. If the honourable member is so concerned about it he should put up a minute to the Standing Orders Committee and have the Standing Orders altered. If the House wants to say that Ministers may have one minute, two minutes, or three minutes in which to answer questions, so be it. There are limitations on the powers given to the Chair. I have read practices, principles and so forth. Sometimes persuasion does not work. I have noticed that that is the case in regard to both sides of the House. The only standing order that the House has given to the Speaker is that the answer be relevant. So, honourable members should not look to the Speaker when they want to stop Ministers speaking; they should look to themselves and alter the Standing Orders to suit themselves.
       </para>
       <para>
        The powers given to the Chair by the Standing Orders for dealing with disorderly conduct are rarely invoked. This is a testimony to the tolerance and respect for the institution held by my predecessors. Those are Harry Jenkins's words, but I say them too. He added-and I add-that there are absolute limits to the tolerance that can be offered. Honourable members should remember that point. The House itself determines its Standing Orders and its practice and the Speaker has the responsibility of ensuring that they are complied with. But this is a two-way street and it is the responsibility of all members of this House to keep order because it is they who give the Standing Orders to me. If honourable members have this deep respect for the institution of Parliament-and I was delighted to hear the Leader of the National Party, the Leader of the Opposition, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and the Prime Minister unanimous in their respect for the House-they, too, will look to the Standing Orders of this House and they, together with me, will ensure that, as the Leader of the National Party said, we lift the standards of parliament. It is in all of our hands, not just mine.
       </para>
       <para>
        Finally, I say to the Leader of the National Party that no one who comes into this House is independent. We all have an allegiance to a political party. Being impartial and fair is a quite different thing. The Chair intends to ensure that the House belongs to all members, not just to a few. I believe that this House belongs to the members of this House of the Parliament. I do not believe that they get a fair enough go to speak in it. But while I am sitting in the chair I will endeavour to insist on fairness. A degree of latitude traditionally has been afforded to party leaders because of the positions they hold. But with that, I remind them, comes a corresponding responsibility. Once again I say that I am delighted to have been elected to this high office and I hope that I can serve this House and the members of this House with integrity and impartiality. If any member would like to speak to me, my door is always open.

        —As I said, it is an honour for me to nominate my friend the honourable member for Grayndler (Mr Leo McLeay). It is my very strong belief that since his election to the House of Representatives in 1979 the honourable member has maintained a record of involvement and achievement in the activities and life of the Parliament which makes him an eminently suitable choice as Deputy Speaker and Chairman of Committees. The honourable member for Grayndler has been a member of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Expenditure since September 1979, including periods as Deputy Chairman between 1981 and 1983 and Chairman since 1983. Under his chairmanship, the House of Representatives Expenditure Committee has undoubtedly grown in both stature and involvement. He has been a member of the Procedure Committee of the House of Representatives since its inception. In addition, he is currently a member of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and the Joint Committee on the New Parliament House. He also served on the Joint House Committee.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       That this is an outstanding record of involvement in the activities of the Parliament is unquestionable. That the honourable member's record is one of achievement is also unquestionable and can, I think, be no better displayed than by the example of the report of the Expenditure Committee entitled `In a Home or at Home', which was the product of his active stewardship and which today is acclaimed by experts across this country as a landmark in the evolution of care for the aged. Indeed, it was of itself a catalyst for many of the Government's present policies on extending care to the aged.
      </para>
      <para>
       The election of the honourable member for Grayndler as the Deputy Speaker and Chairman of Committees would be a milestone along that path of interest, involvement and achievement in the activities and life of the Parliament and specifically the House of Representatives. It would be an honour for the people he represents in the inner western suburbs of Sydney. It is indeed a very long way from his first job many years ago as a telegram boy at the Marrickville post office that today he is offering himself to his colleagues for election to this important position. I trust that honourable members will recognise the qualities and abilities of the honourable member for Grayndler and elect him as the Deputy Speaker and Chairman of Committees of the House of Representatives.

        —It is with a great deal of pleasure that I nominate Clarrie Millar, the honourable member for Wide Bay, to be Chairman of Committees of this Parliament. As we all know, Clarrie won the respect of people from both sides of this House for the manner in which in the past he exercised the responsibility of the position for which I now nominate him. He has been the member for Wide Bay for many years and he has been an incumbent of the position of Deputy Speaker for five years. Over that time both sides of the House found him to be a man who exercised the responsibilities with considerable distinction and absolute impartiality.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       As I endeavoured to identify during the earlier discussion regarding the nominations for your position, Madam Speaker, there are a number of responsibilities which it is essential are exercised by those who sit in the Speaker's chair. These apply equally to the person who is the Chairman of Committees as they do to the person who happens to be Speaker. Certainly, Clarrie Millar has shown to all honourable members his ability to exercise those responsibilities. I think it is worth noting that comments from both sides of the House have paid tribute to the way in which he has exercised those necessary judgments that being Chairman of Committees requires. For example, the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Lionel Bowen) has said of Mr Millar:
      </para>
      <para>
       Millar is a gentleman and he is a credit to the Parliament. I don't agree with his politics, but he's a man you would never disagree with personally.
      </para>
      <para>
       Charles Connelly, the President of the Small Business Association, which is quite outside the Parliament, said of Clarrie Millar:
      </para>
      <para>
       Clarrie Millar is a man of integrity and intelligence. I would like to see him in the Prime Minister's seat.
      </para>
      <para>
       This afternoon we are not talking about him being Prime Minister; we are quite content to have him appointed as Chairman of Committees. Perhaps of even more relevance in this debate are some comments which appeared in the Chronicle, which happens to be published in the electorate of Wide Bay. I am sure that the honourable member for Barton (Mr Punch) will be interested to know that under the heading `Punchlines' there was an anecdote about the honourable member for Wide Bay. It is interesting that you, Madam Speaker, are quoted. Apparently on an occasion in the House you said that Mr Millar had `justifiably earned the respect of members on both sides of the House'. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) is quoted as saying that Mr Millar had `earned both the respect and the affection of all people in the House'. Your predecessor, Madam Speaker, said that he believed that Mr Millar `set a wonderful example for future chairmen of committees'. It is worth noting that in ending `Punchlines' Mr Kev Pearman, the correspondent concerned, said:
      </para>
      <para>
       Those who know our local Member for Wide Bay, Clarrie Millar, would not be surprised by the tributes. As politicians go, he is a true straight-shooter.
      </para>
      <para>
       We know him to be a straight-shooter and a good fellow. We do know that he has exercised and would exercise these responsibilities in a very proper way.
      </para>
      <para>
       There is one other aspect of the responsibilities of the Chairman of Committees to which I wish to advert briefly. I think that in the past there have been far more opportunities for debate at the Committee stage of Bills before the chamber. We all recall that when Speaker Scholes was in the chair a committee of this Parliament looked at the possible extension of the role of committees of the House. I know that at the moment the House of Representatives Committee on Procedure is considering some aspects of the general deliberations of this Parliament. I put to that Committee, to the House, and to whoever is to be elected as Chairman of Committees, that it could well be that the Committee stage of this chamber needs review. I believe that the person who is to be Chairman of Committees has a unique responsibility in that role. Of course, it is under your overall responsibility, Madam Speaker, but the Chairman of Committees does exercise the presidential responsibility at that time when the chamber is not in plenary session but is looking at the details of legislation before it. It is a stage which in the past has been more significant than it is at this time. If any of us are concerned about the freedoms of Parliament, the responsibilities of Parliament, and the ways in which we can implement the views of our constituents, then the Committee stage is an appropriate opportunity to show our concern. It is on that basis, and knowing Mr Millar's own concern in that area and the very high measure of respect that he enjoys from both sides of the House, that it is with a great deal of pleasure that I nominate him to be Chairman of Committees and Deputy Speaker of the House of Representatives.

In speaking to the motion that the honourable member for Grayndler be appointed Chairman of Committees and Deputy Speaker of the House, I am sure that after the remarks by the honourable member for Barton (Mr Punch) every member of the House will be fully aware of the work that Leo has done over many years since his election to the Parliament in 1979.

The honourable member for Barton spoke of the background of the honourable member for Grayndler as a member of other committees. I am sure that that experience will also stand him in good stead for the position. We have talked today about fairness and impartiality. We have talked about whether people in these sorts of positions, particularly the Speaker's position, should be independent. I believe that everybody who is elected to a position of such importance in this Parliament will show the impartiality and fairness that is expected. I am sure that Leo McLeay will carry out those duties as well as anybody else has ever done. I am sure that in following our present Speaker into that position he will show the same skills in the job and the same impartiality and will carry out his responsibilities on behalf of the Parliament with complete fairness. It gives me great pleasure to second the nomination.

        —Madam Speaker, at the outset may I congratulate you on your election to your high office and wish you well in the discharge of your duties. I suppose, by way of an insurance policy, I should congratulate the honourable member for Grayndler (Mr Leo McLeay) on receiving the endorsement of his Party as a candidate for this also very high office and office of considerable significance in the workings of the Parliament. Finally, because I was involved in the by-election for Scullin, may I also congratulate the newly elected member for Scullin. He had a close shave, but he got here and that is what counts. The swing in Scullin was larger in the areas where I campaigned! It is with very much pleasure that I second the nomination of the honourable member for Wide Bay. He has had a long and distinguished career in this Parliament. He has considerable experience in the workings of this Parliament. Indeed, he has made the Parliament his life. Not only has he served on committees and been Chairman of Committees but also has he in fact been an Acting Speaker. Everyone agrees that he has discharged his duties with great dignity and credit to himself and this Parliament. It may not be widely known, but in fact, if I remember correctly, he invented standing order 303. His use of that standing order when in the chair indicates his firmness-a firmness which we expect from occupants of the chair-that has been matched only by his fairness and politeness to all sides of the Parliament. We, whether on the Government side or the Opposition side of the Parliament, can rest assured that our privileges and rights as members of this Parliament will be preserved, protected and enhanced if the honourable member for Wide Bay is elected Chairman of Committees. I therefore urge honourable members to support the honourable member for Wide Bay.

       Sir Charles Davidson was born in 1897. He served in two world wars and was made a Officer of the Order of the British Empire in 1945, having been mentioned twice in dispatches. Sir Charles was a dairy farmer by occupation and a sugar cane farmer before entering Parliament. He was elected for the Country Party to the House of Representatives in 1946 for the Queensland seat of Capricornia. Following a redistribution he was elected member for Dawson in 1949. He was Country Party Whip from 1950 to 1956 before being promoted to the positions of Minister for the Navy, which he held from 1956 to 1958, and Postmaster-General, which he held from 1956 to 1963. He was created a Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire in 1964. Sir Charles was a long-standing and respected member of the House of Representatives and of the Parliament. On behalf of the Government I extend to members of his family our sincere sympathy in their bereavement.

However, those who came into the Parliament after him and who would have followed politics would know of his great contribution to the affairs of the then Country Party, particularly in his native State of Queensland, the fact that he served with great distinction in both World War I and World War II and that he devoted considerable time in a voluntary capacity, to the work of the Asthma Foundation of Queensland, being President of that Foundation between 1964 and 1973. He continuously represented an area of Australia, namely the electorate of Capricornia, which has within it some of the more troubled rural industries at present, with very great success and very great distinction. I know that all members of the Liberal Party and particularly some of his former colleagues in the Country Party, now the National Party of Australia, join in expressing sadness at his death and conveying our sympathy and condolences to his family.

Charlie Davidson, as both the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition have said, rose to some considerable eminence in the ranks in the predecessor of the now National Party of Australia, the Country Party. He was a Queensland dairy farmer and subsequently a cane grower. He held high office in the cane growers' organisation and at the time of the consideration of British entry into the European Community contributed a great deal in debates on whether the Commonwealth Sugar Agreement should continue. I think it is of some interest that many of the problems that are today upon cane growers in Queensland would really not have occurred had Charlie Davidson and others of those days succeeded in achieving a continuation of the Commonwealth Sugar Agreement in spite of Britain entering the European Community.

       Charlie Davidson was a Postmaster-General, a Minister for the Navy, a Whip for the then Country Party and, of course, a Deputy Leader of the Party. He was one of that generation of Australians who served their country in both World War I and World War II. In fact, he left his name on two particular ridges after campaigns in New Guinea in World War II and rose to the rank of lieutenant-colonel with the 42nd Battalion while serving in New Guinea. As the Prime Minister has said, he was awarded the Order of the British Empire, he was twice mentioned in despatches and, of course, he subsequently became a Knight of the British Empire. Charlie Davidson was an outstanding Queenslander. He represented that State very forcefully in this House. Those of us who knew him here and elsewhere regarded him not only as a good friend and a good mate but also as a great Australian. To Lady Davidson, their son and two daughters and other members of the family, on behalf of the Party, my wife and myself, I extend our deepest sympathy.

While Sir Charles Davidson served in this House he occupied the positions of Minister for the Navy and Postmaster-General, as it was then known. I note that during the valedictory on the night of his retirement Mr McEwen, later Sir John McEwen, had this to say about him-among quite a lot of other words-which I believe indicates the man that he was:

       How many of us would like to leave this House on retirement with those words having been said about us? I would say that few of us could do so. That was the kind of man he was, not only in this Parliament but throughout Australia. In whatever position he served, he served in that manner.
      </para>
      <para>
       The tributes that have been paid with regard to his service in this House are well known. But it is interesting to note that his total service was to the country of Australia, both in peacetime and wartime, and to this Parliament. Quite a few years ago I read a book entitled S'pose I Die-the story of Evelyn Maunsell, the mother of former Senator Maunsell, which was written by Hector Holthouse. Her experiences with regard to the young Charles Davidson-later Sir Charles Davidson-were rather interesting. At that time he was a dairy farmer on the Tablelands. She stated:

       One day, plodding along the muddy track through our scrub, I met a bullock team pulling a wagon-load of logs and driven by a young man so spotless and clean in fresh trousers and Jackie Howe singlet that I stopped to talk to him. His name was Charlie Davidson, he was just back from the war, and was staying with his sister and brother-in-law and helping out by driving the bullock team.
      </para>
      <para>
       I met him again several times after that . . .
      </para>
      <para>
       He was always so neat and spotless that the name suited him. After rising to the rank of colonel in World War II he played a prominent part in the organisation of the Country Party, became Postmaster General, and now he is Sir Charles Davidson. But I shall always remember him the way I saw him that first day up at Malanda, spotlessly clean in the mud, and driving a team of bullocks.
      </para>
      <para>
       I wonder how many times when he was a member he had to drive the bullocks in this House to try to get the direction right and the emphasis straight. That occurred just after the First World War when he went into primary industry. He not only served the constituency of Dawson but also was a cane farmer within it. He represented the sugar industry in many different ways, including in a secretarial form within his own cane growers organisation and for a time with the Australian Sugar Producers Association. While he was a member of this House he represented the interests of the sugar industry right down the line and was the best advocate for it.
      </para>
      <para>
       He served the country people. It is interesting to note that he is given credit for the regionalisation of the Australian Broadcasting Commission, as it was then known, in Townsville and Rockhampton. It was a matter of some moment to me when those facilities were removed. They were instigated during Sir Charles's time. He certainly set a standard of performance within the electorate of Dawson that we have found very hard to follow. But I believe that George Shaw for a short time and Dr Rex Patterson for a period of 10 years showed that same example of service to the community as did Sir Charles. His war service was rather interesting. It has been noted that during his war service he had a hill and a ridge in New Guinea named after him. If one looks at the Sydney Morning Herald of 15 September 1956 one will see an article which mentions that during the biggest mail strike in Australia's history the posties in Sydney named a walkway between piled up bags of mail Davidson's Alley after him. He had a great capacity as a man. As I say, he served his country in many different ways. He set an example. He was probably able to do more in his 87 years than any of us would achieve in several lifetimes.
      </para>
      <para>
       I would like also to mention the tribute of the ex-diggers from his battalion. I was moved by the comment by a sergeant, I believe, who served under him in New Guinea who simply said, as a final farewell to him at the grave, that Charlie Davidson had the capacity to make every soldier a hero. I believe that that was a fitting tribute to a man who led that battalion. For those of us who met him in civilian life and during his parliamentary career he was also the person who made each of us feel a little more important and, perhaps, prouder to be Australians.

Sir Charles Davidson, KBE, was a former Deputy Leader of the National Party under its previous name, a former Federal Minister and a former Federal member for Capricornia and Dawson. Although I never met Sir Charles, he was a lifelong friend of my grandfather, Mr D. A. (Archie) McIntyre, who is now 87 years of age and a strong National Party supporter. The association started when they sat beside each other in class at Townsville Grammar School in north Queensland during their period of attendance at that school in 1912 and 1913. It continued until Sir Charles's death on 29 November 1985. Coincidentally, the late Mr A. D. Hooper-grandfather of my wife Lyn-who is in the gallery today-was also in the same class.

       On many occasions Sir Charles visited my grandparents at their home in Mackay. He shared with them a love of fishing. In fact, like many of us here, he was very fond of Queensland mud crabs. I was speaking to my grandfather on the weekend and he told me that, when he visited Canberra in the 1950s, he was the guest of Sir Charles Davidson and former Prime Minister Sir Arthur Fadden. The latter he had come to know through their joint interest in Souths Football Club in Townsville.

       Sir Charles was never lost for words. My grandfather once asked him how he managed the portfolio of Postmaster-General. Jokingly, the reply came back as quick as a flash: `Just leave it to the bureaucracy'. Some people might be unkind enough to suggest that Sir Charles was a prophet. Mr Deputy Speaker, I join with other members in extending my condolence and sympathy to Lady Davidson and to members of her family.

       That this House expresses its deep regret at the death on 30 January 1986 of Mr Ray William Thorburn, a former member for the division of Cook from 1972 to 1975, places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service, and tenders its profound sympathy to his wife and family.

       Ray William Thorburn was born at Sutherland, New South Wales, on 15 November 1930 and was educated at Sydney Technical College. Ray had a strong interest in his community and local government throughout his life. In 1964 he was elected to the Sutherland Shire Council and remained a member until his election to this House in 1972. In his later years as a shire councillor he was President of the Sutherland Shire and an executive member of the Local Government Association of New South Wales. From my own experience, I can pay tribute to the intensity of the commitment of Ray Thorburn to that important tier of government-local government.

      <para>
       On his election to this House in December 1972, as part of the historic return of the Australian Labor Party to government, he brought to this place his strong concern for the role of local government in Australia and its relationship to State and Federal government. He brought as well very real concerns for those he served and their problems. He was, in addition, a loyal member of the Australian Labor Party and its strong supporter. He held the position of Vice-President of the Cronulla Branch from 1956 until 1970.

       Ray Thorburn's premature death on 30 January this year was a loss to his Party and to Australia. On behalf of the Government, I extend to his family-his wife, Joan, and his children, Peter and Ann-our sincere sympathy in their bereavement.

I certainly recall his very strong interest in local government and his very deep commitment to the civic and political affairs of the Sutherland area of Sydney, having served not only as President of the Sutherland Shire but also for a period of three years as the member for Cook. He also showed a very deep interest in the fortunes and activities of the Australian motor vehicle industry, having had a very considerable association with aspects of the motor manufacturing industry. His death at the comparatively early age of 55 was untimely. The Opposition, and in particular the many members on this side of the House who remember Ray as a member of the Parliament, extend their sympathies to his wife and children.

Ray Thorburn was a great acquisition to the Australian Labor Party and made a very significant contribution to it in terms of local government, representing it here in the short period of the Whitlam years. His death was untimely. I am very mindful of the fact that during the many election campaigns in which he participated he always invited me and others to assist in trying to win a very difficult seat.

       Subsequent to his retirement from politics he was kind enough to invite me to endeavour to assist him in establishing a business in which he hoped he and his family were going to enjoy some success. Due to ill health that was not the result he achieved, but from the point of view of the endeavour of the man to assist his family one could see the intensity he had exhibited here in earlier days. He was a quite outstanding Australian and was very dedicated to the cause of the nation, very dedicated to the interests of the Labor Party, and particularly dedicated to his family. I regret that I was unable to attend his funeral because of other commitments. I take this opportunity of expressing my condolences to his widow and children.

He served outside this House in local government, where he won great respect in the St George and Sutherland areas. In an analysis of the 1974 campaign in the Sydney Morning Herald I was interested to note that he was known locally as Mr Nice Guy. He was certainly a very likeable man. He served the Australian Labor Party well. Those of us who knew him in this place regarded him as a pleasant member and a very pleasant companion.

Ray and I were opponents in five campaigns from 1972 through to 1980, Ray having beaten me to enter the House in 1972, while I returned in 1975 by defeating Ray. Such is the nature of politics in the Sutherland Shire that all the campaigning did not affect the close friendship that had developed from the days when Ray first became a councillor on the Sutherland Shire Council in 1964 and I became the Federal member for Hughes in 1966. Over many years we attended the same functions, performed similar duties together, and grew to know each other very well indeed. As with all his friends, I was shocked by his early death, though we had known he did not enjoy robust health for a long time and, in fact, had been in very poor health recently. I was most disappointed that I was in the Philippines for their election and was unable to attend the funeral and pay my last respects to a good friend who was a worthy opponent for many years. I do this today.

       Ray Thorburn was a man of quiet and gentle disposition who represented the area in which he was born with an application and dedication which won him the respect, admiration and affection of all whom he served. Ray was a genuinely nice fellow and a fine man. Born in Sutherland and orphaned before the age of 12, there can be no doubting that Ray Thorburn overcame many disadvantages in his life. There can also be no doubting that Ray's greatest strength came from his charming and lovely wife Joan, whom he married romantically on Valentine's Day 1953, his son Peter and his daughter Ann.
      </para>
      <para>
       The House has already heard of his role in the Federal Parliament and his importance as a councillor and as the President of the Sutherland Shire Council. Let me repeat that Ray dedicated himself to his onerous duties as a member of this Parliament and as Shire President, which duties he combined for over a year, without the slightest concern for his own welfare or health. He will be long remembered in the Sutherland Shire for the great contribution he made over the long period he served in public office.
      </para>
      <para>
       It should be mentioned also that, Ray, in his retirement, was a director of the Sutherland Hospital Board for five years; a post from which, ironically, he was removed by his own Party in State politics. He and I had many a chuckle about the irony of this. He will be remembered also for the nine years he served as President of the Cronulla Labor and Workingmen's Club Ltd through a time of that club's great difficulties. I know he would not want me to mention the discussions we had, but this too was part of the man's great service to an isolated and insular part of Sydney which will remember him with great affection and respect.

       On the election of Arthur Gietzelt to the Senate in 1971, Ray Thorburn became the Shire President of the Sutherland Shire. As Shire President he was responsible for many local initiatives, including the development of the Sutherland Civic Centre and the expansion of the E. G. Waterhouse National Camellia Gardens at Caringbah. The first political rally I attended was held in 1972 at Miranda. The current Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) spoke most eloquently in support of Ray Thorburn's candidature for the seat of Cook. Ray Thorburn was recognised as a hard working and accessible local member. I believe his greatest achievement was his success in persuading the then Prime Minister, Gough Whitlam, in 1974 to purchase the Towra Point wetlands to ensure that this unique wildlife refuge on Botany Bay was preserved for all time.

       Following victories in the 1972 and 1974 elections, Ray was unsuccessful in 1975. Despite a devastating political and personal loss and a great deal of anger and bitterness amongst his supporters, Ray Thorburn conceded defeat with dignity and honour at the Liberal Party of Australia's election night celebration. Ray Thorburn also served his local community as a member of the Sutherland Hospital Board, a member of the Miranda Co-operative and as the President of the Cronulla Labor Workingmen's Club Ltd. Ray Thorburn spoke at the first meeting which I attended of the Cronulla branch of the Australian Labor Party in October 1972. The last time I attended the Cronulla branch of the Labor Party was as a visitor in June last year, when Ray Thorburn played an active role in the debate on tax reform.

People have already spoken about his extensive involvement in local government and his parliamentary service, which ranged across a number of areas and included a very deep commitment to Aboriginal affairs. I would, however, without injecting any partisan note into this motion, seek to say briefly something about the philosophy which guided Ray Thorburn throughout his life. He was very much a political animal. He dedicated much of his life to service to the Australian Labor Party and the Australian people whom our Party seeks to serve. He was an avowed supporter of the democratic socialist traditions of the Labor Party. Whatever view honourable members might have about those principles, I hope that they would all recognise that he held those principles dearly and he worked conscientiously throughout his life to promote them. His commitment to a more just, humane and co-operative society, I believe, has been vindicated in part at least, by your election today, Madam Speaker, and I am sure that he would be very proud to see you occupy that position.

         —I have to say that my holiday at Mimosa Rocks was interrupted by the crackling of the transistor which indicated that even on New Year's Day the Opposition spokesman was at work calling on a campaign against people receiving pensions and benefits. It is interesting to see that the honourable member for Richmond apparently believes that pensioners and the unemployed ought to be dealt with in a similar way to drug dealers. Indeed, that is typical, if I might say so, of the attitude of the Opposition. To the Opposition, people on social security are fair game to be victimised because they are old, sick or unemployed. The Opposition apparently sees some mileage in prancing around the country spouting fanciful figures concerning so-called social security overpayments. The Leader of the Opposition on the Mark Day Show last year said that on the basis of investigations made over the years we will probably be looking at 15 per cent of social welfare payments. The honourable member for Bradfield talked about overpayments representing $300m a year. The reality is that as a result of a range of Government initiatives, net annual overpayments last financial year were less than $20m. That is less than half of one per cent of a total bill of almost $15 billion that we spend in the social security area. When we talk about the loss of money we should remember that at the end of the Fraser-Howard years the Joint Committee of Public Accounts found that almost $3 billion was owed in tax. In 1984 the Public Accounts Committee said that the amount of tax outstanding was a matter of concern. At 30 June 1983 it was $2,904m; 90 per cent of which was income tax-$2,604m. So when we talk about overpayments and when we run around the country talking vague figures we ought to remember that $2.5 billion-nearly $3 billion-was owing to the Australian Taxation Office when we came into power. It was that kind of stewardship which we saw.

        We heard a great deal over the break about supporting parent benefits. We could pay for supporting parent benefits three times over if that kind of money had been collected under that previous administration. That is a subject that the Opposition is extraordinarily silent about when it talks about overpayments. I want to make a couple of quite serious points about this subject. When we talk about overpayments and about setting up some kind of campaign, let us get into our minds what has happened over the last decade in terms of the distribution of low income people. As a result of a range of policies there has been a vast concentration of low income people and pensioners in the western suburbs of Sydney and Melbourne, in high rise estates, in the inner urban areas and in areas like the Hunter and Wollongong. Across this country there are substantial areas of such very high concentration. Many of these people are living on common estates. This kind of call that was put out by the honourable member for Richmond-who perhaps ought to move around and look at some of these communities-is essentially setting neighbour against neighbour. It is setting up a scare campaign which would have a massive impact on the social fabric of these communities. It would victimise innocent people and waste their time and resources.
       </para>
       <para>
        I refer to one example of what occurred under the kind of policies of the previous Government. It is an example which is a shame on any government and on the history of social security in this country. It is the example of the so-called Greek social security conspiracy case. The Greek communities of Melbourne and Sydney were victimised by the Government of the time and yet ultimately no one was convicted of any crime. That is what comes out of this kind of emotional approach to a subject that has to be put into proper perspective. Let me assure the House that the Government, where necessary and where possible, is committed to seeking to reduce overpayments to the smallest extent possible, but we will not achieve that goal by that kind of emotional suggestion made by the honourable member for Richmond that people ought to be dobbed in.

Firstly, he would be aware that in the last Budget, looking at the diesel fuel aspect of the cost component for farmers, we gave a rebate. I am not in any sense trying to say that that discharges the responsibility we have in the area the honourable gentleman is questioning me about. I am simply saying that it is indicative of the concern that we have about the problems in that area. In the considerations that we will be undertaking later this week the matters that the honourable gentleman refers to will be an important part. I go further than that and say that the Minister for Primary Industry will be bringing submissions to the Cabinet in the relatively near future taking into account the crisis considerations that the honourable gentleman has been referring to in his question. So it will be not only in the considerations this week but also in other considerations before the Cabinet in the near future that the problems of the rural industry in general will be taken into account, and part of those considerations will be the question of fuel costs.

         —Or is it Speakerperson, to get the non-sexist terminology these days? In answer to the honourable member, it is a little early to make any definitive statement about the position on the part of this Government. The honourable member would have noted that other governments are adopting the same attitude by practice. The reason is simply that the count of the vote in the Philippines has not been concluded. As honourable members would be aware from newspaper reporting, under the Constitution the count has to be conducted in the National Assembly. Under the Constitution it is supposed to be completed within 15 days unless there are pressing reasons of national importance which justify its being extended. I would sincerely trust that that provision was not invoked because I think it would add to the suspicion and doubt which is manifest concerning this election.

        The Government feels gravely disturbed at the accounts which have come forward about irregularities and fraud in connection with the conduct of this election. As soon as the vote is concluded and when substantial and substantiable reports on the conduct of the election by observers are available and have been studied, we will be in a position to make a considered statement, and that statement will form the basis of our attitude in the bilateral contact we have with the Philippines thereafter.
       </para>
       <para>
        The things that disturb us are, for instance, a statement issued on 10 February by the joint leader of the international observer team organised by the United States Republican and Democratic parties institutes observing that polling and counting proceeded in some areas without incident. It noted, however, that irregularities and abuses had occurred. It referred, to be specific, to irregularities in polling procedures, such as improperly locked and sealed ballot boxes and election returns, the absence of voters' names on voting precinct roles, especially in Manila, and the ineffective application of measures to prevent multiple voting. The leaders referred also to abuses designed to affect the outcome of the vote, such as vote buying, intimidation, snatching of ballot boxes, tampered election returns and refusal of admission to polling places of observers from the National Citizens Movement for Free Elections, or NAMFREL. Officials of the independent NAMFREL have cited fraud in 56 of the country's 74 provinces. Senator Lugar, leader of the United States official observer team, has expressed concern about a deliberate delay in the publication of voting figures which could facilitate manipulation of the vote.

        At a more immediate and domestic level, an Australian commercial television team from Channel 7 was interrupted at a polling place by a team of what were described as `armed goons' who took away their television and sound recording equipment. One of these so described `armed goons' held a gun, a cocked firearm, near the head of the cameraman and fired it, leaving the cameraman in an understandable state of stress and shock for some time after. I under stand these `goons' sought to tamper with the voting boxes at that ballot centre. We note with concern these reports of serious anomalies and fraud. As I said, we will carefully consider all the facts which become available to us.

       <para>
        Having said that, I think it is very important to put this on the record: The serious economic and social problems which afflict the Philippines are not going to be fixed up by an election, whatever its outcome. They will require the application of determined policies to bring about social and economic redistribution as a consequence of a wide-ranging program of reform. In turn, that will require determination on the part of whoever the authorities are to confront entrenched interests in that community, be they cronies or oligarchs, or the strong-armed goons who were described to the House by me a few seconds ago. Unless government is prepared to do that, I am afraid the prognosis for the social and political future of the Philippines is a very depressing one.

         —I thank the honourable gentleman for his question and compliment him on the way in which over the last several months he has consistently represented to me the interests of his constituents who have a very direct concern with defence housing. On my visits to Townsville I have made sure that I have had the views of both the defence forces and their families put before me very firmly. Among the views they have put forward to me and to the housing task force we have had in operation, and also the views in that regard of the Returned Services League and the Armed Forces Federation of the Services, there has been a very firm presentation of cogent argument against the course of action suggested by the honourable member in that Press release. There are many very good reasons for that. One is the unique nature of service conditions, the circumstances in which service personnel are obliged to move around the country frequently because they get frequent postings. They find themselves in a position in which, if they are placed in an uncertain rental market, an uncertain environment, very grave inconvenience is caused to their families, on top of the inconveniences they already suffer from those frequent shifts and changes in their children's education experiences and the like. To impose on service personnel the additional burden of finding a house in what will often be an uncertain rental market and certainly a changing rental market from city to city will be a very considerable burden indeed.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Furthermore, operational questions are involved in the need to provide adequate housing. Those operational questions are related to a requirement to make absolutely certain that the armed forces are readily available in circumstances in which they may need to be deployed and are also readily available for the purposes of training. This would also be considerably affected by any proposition to move over to effectively a free market rental situation for the defence forces. Very considerable damage would be done to morale in the defence forces by pursuing the course of action now suggested by the Opposition.
       </para>
       <para>
        As to the question of the $120m savings that are proposed, I do not know exactly where those savings come from. If they include a saving, as suggested, in the area of Defence Force houses-our annual allocation for defence houses is upwards of $60m-that explains about half of that figure. I can only assume that the other half of that figure denotes an intention on the part of the Opposition not only to throw the defence forces on to the private market but also an intention to ensure that the defence forces pay something like market rental. The circumstances that would emerge from that would mean a very substantial diminution in service conditions. In the circumstances in which members of the defence forces now find themselves, in which there is a substantial concern among them regarding their conditions, they would be faced with an imposition which I think many of them could not bear.
       </para>
       <para>
        The fact of the matter is that this Government is seriously considering the position of service personnel in many areas of service conditions, which is in marked contrast to the actions of our predecessors. I am not surprised that the Opposition wants to walk away from the question of an obligation in the public housing sector to the defence forces. After all, at the end of the 1970s the previous Government was spending about $4m a year on Defence Force housing. It managed to get up to about $16m a year. We have taken it to $60m. Under the propositions which we are putting forward now upwards of $700m will be spent over the next decade. That will ensure that members of the defence forces in the first place get the type of housing that they deserve, that they can experience the normal-as normal as possible-housing conditions of the rest of the community and are not treated as second rate citizens and are not at a severe disadvantage.
       </para>
       <para>
        In addition, it is our intention-I state it here quite firmly-that we will not be moving to a situation of effectively imposing full market rental rates on service personnel, as apparently at least is implied in the positions being adopted by the Opposition. Our view is that that is a necessary and a just condition of service. Our concern is to ensure that service personnel will be effectively placed in the situation in which they are placed at the moment.
       </para>
       <para>
        Of course from time to time there will be reviews of rent. Those reviews will take place-as was set up by the previous Government-on an annual basis in about April of each year. The types of adjustments which they will receive are the types of adjustment to which they have been used to this point.
       </para>
       <para>
        We are not just mindlessly pursuing that policy. It was part of our decision that where there was a circumstance in which service personnel desired to be able to move into the private market that should be facilitated more than it had been in the past. It is possible that some savings will result from that.
       </para>
       <para>
        I state quite clearly, because there has been a considerable amount of nervousness in the Services on the future of Defence Force housing, that we in this Government will not adopt the Opposition policy of privatisation in service housing. We will not adopt the policy of moving service personnel to effectively paying full market rental prices. Both those options would seriously damage the operational capabilities of the defence forces and would be a marked injustice on service personnel.

Also it should be pointed out that in the administration of justice it is expected that there would not be an overzealous zeal to obtain a prosecution if there were not sufficient evidence to warrant it. In fairness to the administration of justice, it is also very important that no unfair emphasis be placed on evidence which might be to the detriment of the accused.

        As I understand the present situation, and rather surprisingly, the Attorney-General in the Northern Territory has announced, as a result of the finding of what is deemed to be a further piece of evidence, that the accused mother has been released and irrespective of the outcome of the inquiry which he proposes to institute no further action will be taken in respect of her alleged involvement in that tragedy.
       </para>
       <para>
        I think that it is worth commenting now-the Sydney Morning Herald adverted to it-that there appears to be very strong evidence that the forensic tests that were carried out were not in accordance with established procedures and that was known to the prosecution. There is other evidence from forensic experts in Australia that the evidence given was not in accordance with what one would call scientific capacity or understanding of what should have happened in terms of undertaking those tests. That was not adverted to.
       </para>
       <para>
        Further, when the inquiry was instituted, particularly involving the appropriate agents that were to be used in pursuing those tests-they came from Germany-the responsible scientist there was not consulted as to whether the tests carried out would be accepted as being proper evidence to justify what was led by the prosecution in endeavouring to obtain a prosecution.
       </para>
       <para>
        Finally, there seems to be the further evidence that when there was a reassessment of that inquiry by the Solicitor-General in the Northern Territory it was not a fair reassessment because those matters were not brought into consideration.
       </para>
       <para>
        Therefore, we have the position that forensic experts in Australia say that the evidence led was not in accordance with forensic skill or capacity, the further doubt that it was known allegedly to the Northern Territory that the tests carried out were not conducted in accordance with what the German authorities would have regarded as being suitable and, further, when the evidence could have been submitted to the appropriate German scientist concerned it was not submitted to him.
       </para>
       <para>
        The allegation is that there has been an attempt to cover up the actions of the administrators of justice in the Northern Territory-actions in endeavouring to obtain a conviction rather than looking at the fairness of the evidence that should have been presented to the jury. It is a matter of record that there is some comment from one member of the jury that the jury now feels that it might have had at least an opportunity to acquit the accused rather than otherwise. These are not new accusations; they are known to the Government of the Northern Territory. The significant thing that is very important is that the Northern Territory has a responsibility to do something about this matter pursuant to the Northern Territory (Self-Government) Act passed in 1978. The self-government Act of 1978 appoints the Administrator who is responsibile for the maintenance of laws in the Northern Territory and the administration of justice. Also, he has the advice of an Executive Council, which is made up of appropriate Ministers to advise him whether justice has in fact been carried out because there is a responsibility there to maintain law and order and particularly the principles of justice. One of the matters of concern is why that has not been acted on before in view of the fact that it was known that there was evidence that obviously had not been led. It will obviously come out in the course of an inquiry.
       </para>
       <para>
        I think what the honourable member has said today is most appropriate because what the Sydney Morning Herald has said adverts to the concern in Australia that perhaps a trial had taken place and the full facts had not been placed before the jury. There is serious concern whether there was not a personal involvement in an endeavour to get a prosecution rather than looking at it in terms of what evidence was available and the appropriate test.

        I also want to mention a notice of motion that was given to our Party yesterday by the honourable member for Charlton who adverted to all those facts. He has an obligation because, as honourable members know, one of his constituents happens to be Mr Chamberlain himself. Naturally we can understand the tragedy to this family. However, let me come to this point in respect of the administration of justice: I think it would be appropriate to have a judicial inquiry. I think it is important that it must be wide-ranging. The terms of reference must be such that they would not be limited only to the evidence introduced into the case. They also must be related to the conduct of the officers concerned. In that respect it would be appropriate for the inquiry to be taken by some judicial officer outside the Northern Territory. In that respect I would say that it would be quite appropriate-in fact I would welcome it-that there be a request from the Northern Territory to make available a Federal judge or some other appropriate person to conduct such an inquiry. I think it would be in accordance with the interests of the-

It is fair enough that those comments should be made. As to what is going to happen to the level of the Australian dollar in the immediate future, I am not going to comment. All I will say is that this Government will continue to administer the economic policy of this country in a way which will continue to give it what those in opposition were never able to do, that is, a rate of economic growth almost double the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development average. The OECD predicts an average of about less than 2 1/2 per cent for 1986. The figure for Australia is 4 1/4 per cent. We will have a situation in which Australia will be the only country in the OECD which will be reducing its unemployment level. That management of the Australian economy will be continued in a way which will be appropriate. In that context, those things over which we have control will be administered to achieve the results of maintaining steady economic growth at sustainable levels of inflation. There are some elements in regard to the operation of the Australian economy which are outside our control and it would be inappropriate in the light of that fact for me to suggest what the level will be in the near future.

         —I thank the honourable member for Leichhardt for his question. I am sure that I speak for all members of this House in conveying the sympathy of the Parliament to all those Australians in the region who suffered as a result of the impact of Cyclone Winifred which hit the north Queensland coastline on 1 February of this year. The severe damage associated with that cyclone extended from the north of Townsville to Cairns and west to the Atherton Tableland. There was very considerable damage. I will not go into all of it. However, some indication of the ferocity of the cyclone may be gauged from the fact that 213 banana growers have lost all their crops. As honourable members will know, many sugar producers were very hard hit. Of course, the narrow economic base in the area affected means that unemployment is likely to be more pronounced than it would otherwise be.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        We in the Government were deeply concerned about the impact of Cyclone Winifred. I asked the Minister for Primary Industry immediately to fly up there, which he did. I am indebted to him. The Minister was able to give me a direct firsthand report on the impact of the cyclone. We moved immediately as a government to extend aid under the Commonwealth-State natural disaster relief arrangements. Under those arrangements, Queensland meets the first $10.48m of expenditure in 1985-86. As I understand it, Queensland has already spent more than that on natural disasters this year. Under the terms of the scheme that means that further payments will be shared equally by the Commonwealth and the Queensland governments for the next $7.86m of assistance and thereafter the Commonwealth will fund the additional expenditure in terms of a ratio of 3 to 1. While talking about payments, we ensured that the Department of Social Security acted quickly so that it would be in a position to handle claims for assistance very expeditiously.
       </para>
       <para>
        Following the report from the Minister for Primary Industry on the damage caused by the cyclone and discussions between Commonwealth and State officials, Cabinet has also agreed on the following additional measures: The possible diversion of employees on existing community employment program projects to assist with immediate clean up activities in the affected areas and the provision of funding to various local councils through the Commonwealth element of the CEP for a Cyclone Winifred special area rehabilitation program.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am also pleased to say that through the Commonwealth local government development program we have made arrangements for Mr Duncan Beggs, the city engineer from Darwin, to assist the Johnstone and Cardwell shires organise clean-up and reconstruction work. Honourable members would appreciate that his experience in the aftermath of cyclones Tracy, Gretel and Max in northern Australia should be of particular value.
       </para>
       <para>
        I say also that the Government has welcomed the establishment of a national appeal for victims of Cyclone Winifred, and donations of over $2 to that appeal are an eligible tax deduction. I think that honourable member will see that the Government expeditiously and with full understanding moved in its various arms of government to do everything that it could to assist. In the very first place, the full relevant services of the defence forces were made available. Following that, in the aftermath of the cyclone, we have taken the steps to which I have adverted. Further consultations will take place between officials of the Commonwealth and the Queensland Government. In the light of those discussions and when the full financial impact of the cyclone can be determined, the arrangements to which I have referred will flow through.

Mr Costigan also appeared before the Caucus committee dealing with the Australia Card. So I have heard many of his views before. I have considerable puzzlement with regard to the position taken by Mr Costigan, because, in fact, his report to government and his stressing the need for identification of bank accounts and the ability to trace the money trail were a major factor in propelling the Government towards the solution of a whole range of these problems that has been adopted by proposing the introduction of the Australia Card. When Mr Costigan, under questioning by the Caucus committee, suggested some of the proposals that he has now made public, he was finally put in a position of agreeing that if one were to have a tax file number of a sufficient integrity it would have to be supported very much in the way we intend to support the Australia Card. I must say that Mr Costigan's contributions to this whole debate have been somewhat puzzling.

        —In an article in the Australian Financial Review of Friday, 31 January this year, Michael Byrnes, a journalist in Indonesia, reported on a visit by a delegation of members of the Parliamentary Liberal Party of Australia to Indonesia, including Irian Jaya. In his article he made a number of very important errors which I would like to clarify for the record. For example, he claimed that the delegation edged Australia into a new involvement in the Indonesia-Papua New Guinea border problems. I emphasise that at no stage did the delegation, any member of it, or I as leader, express such a view. We did not, as was alleged, at any time speak of a direct involvement for Australia in the Papua New Guinea-West Irian border issue. In fact, we emphasised that the matter was entirely a bilateral issue between Indonesia and Papua New Guinea and that Australia had no direct interest other than an understandable desire to see stability in the region which includes our own common sea border.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       In another part of the article he referred to a meeting which the delegation had with a number of people who had been sent back by Papua New Guinea across the border into Irian Jaya. He referred in the article to `a private meeting requested by the MPs with the prisoners'. The fact of the matter is that at a dinner on the previous night I had inquired of the Governor of Irian Jaya whether he was holding persons in his gaols who were previously border crossers. He affirmed that they were and then said `Would you like to see them? We have no secrets', or words to that effect. On the basis of that, of course, we accepted and on the following day a visit to the gaol was arranged. To suggest that we actually initiated a request to visit the gaol is completely false and only adds substance to his allegation made earlier that we were in fact forcing Australia into a closer relationship or closer involvement than had previously been the case.

      <para>
       As I stated earlier, the message I was putting over quite clearly was that, where there is a common border between Irian Jaya and Australia, of course we have a direct interest and a stake. Equally, we have an interest in the overall stability of the region. At no stage did I say that we were involved in any way with the Papua New Guinea-West Irian border.

       Discrimination against Women

       To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled: The Petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:
      </para>
      <para>
       That whereas the Commonwealth of Australia ratified the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women in 1983, the Government of Victoria in passing the Planning (Brothels) Act 1984 is in breach of Article 6 of the Convention which says that ``States Parties shall take all appropriate measures, including legislation, to suppress all forms of traffic in women and exploitation of prostitution of women''.
      </para>
      <para>
       That the Victorian Planning (Brothels) Act 1984 provides legal authority to brothel operators to traffic in and exploit the prostitution of women and to live off the earnings of prostitutes.
      </para>
      <para>
       That whereas the Federal Minister for Health has counselled citizens to shun promiscuity (The Australian 26/1/85) because of the serious and sometimes fatal health hazards, the operations of legalised brothels encourages promiscuity and the spread of diseases, including AIDS.
      </para>

       Your petitioners therefore pray:

       Export of Live Sheep

      <para>
       According to the Senate Select Committee report one million sheep have died during export to the Middle East in the last 5 years. At least 2% die on each voyage, in addition to the large numbers which may die as a result of particularly adverse conditions, for example 40,000 due to fire, 15,000 due to cold at Portland and 15,000 recently due to humidity near Jedda. Beyond the mortality figures, all sheep endure the stress of the voyage and the cruelty of halal slaughter (which has recently been banned in Britain).
      </para>
      <para>
       Your petitioners most humbly pray that the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled should accept the findings of the Senate Select Committee. In particular:
      </para>
      <para>
       (1) to phase out the live sheep export trade over 5 years and to substitute for it a refrigerated sheepmeat trade,
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) in the interim, to give the Australian Agricultural Health and Quarantine Service responsibility for the welfare of export sheep in Australia, including the power to stop abuses,

      <para>
       To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled:
      </para>
      <para>
       (i) We regret that the $4,595 tax free threshold for overseas students was recently abolished by the Government. This places an unfair burden on overseas students who are required to pay a tax of 33 per cent on every dollar earned with no minimum income threshold.
      </para>
      <para>
       (ii) Overseas students encounter numerous problems such as exorbitant tuition fees, racism, communication and interaction. Part-time working opportunity has served to alleviate increasing financial problems in the past, and we hope that this will continue to be so.

      <para>
       Therefore, we the undersigned citizens of Australia and overseas students call upon the Government to;

       (i) Reinstate the tax-free threshold for overseas students.

       That we being persons connected with and employed in the building industry within Australia deplore the attempts to enforce compulsory unionisation within the architectural profession and in particular do oppose all attempts at compulsory unionisation, particularly by the Association of Draughting, Supervisory and Technical Employees and base such opposition on the conflict with the essence of a professional standing, a conflict with the Architects Acts and a conflict with basic Common Law interests, particularly in respect of the Architect being independent in supporting the interests of his client, and further that if an Architect is directly involved with a Building Industry Union that this would be a conflict of interest in the role of the Architect as a Quasi-Arbitrator between Proprietor and Builder.
      </para>

       Any such proposal to require compulsory unionisation of Architects discriminates against and inhibits progress within the profession and the building industry and curtails employment throughout the Nation.

       Australian Bill of Rights Legislation
      </title>
      <para>
       To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of South Australia showeth that: Your petitioners pray that Your Honourable House will reject the proposed Australian Bill of Rights Bill 1985 for the following reasons:
      </para>
      <para>
       1. We believe as a matter of faith and judgment that the proposed legislation is anti-God and its implemention will result in attacks on the Christian church and the promotion of a State religion based on secular humanism;
      </para>
      <para>
       2. That there is no need for legislation of this kind since the principles of freedom are already enshrined in Common Law and that it will cause more problems than it seeks to solve.
      </para>
      <para>
       3. That there is a potential threat to our national security through making treaties of this kind with foreign nations, many of which do not share a common heritage and do not practice many of the principles that they have covenanted to uphold;
      </para>
      <para>
       4. The methods being used to introduce this legislation are secretive and a blatant misuse of the external affairs powers under Section 51 of the Australian Constitution and that further more are contrary to the spirit of the Constitution;
      </para>
      <para>
       5. That the implementation of the legislation through a process of new educational initiatives will result in the centralised control of education and this will inevitably lead to the destruction of States' rights. And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will every pray.

       National Flag
      </title>

      </para>
      <para>
       1. They are completely satisfied with the design of the existing Australian National Flag.
      </para>
      <para>
       2. They are aware it properly reflects the immutable characteristics of Australia, namely:
      </para>
      <para>
       (a) The Union Jack, itself the creation of three Christian Crosses, represents the Nation's historical origin and the source of its language and law;
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) The Southern Cross on an azure blue background signifying its geographical location on this planet Earth;
      </para>
      <para>
       (c) The large star depicting the advent of Federation in 1901.
      </para>
      <para>
       3. They know the Flag has been a source of inspiration to generations of Australians in peace and war.
      </para>
      <para>
       4. They recall that millions of native-born Australians and newcomers to these shores from other parts of the world have become united under its proud symbolism.
      </para>
      <para>
       5. They are certain that any change to the Flag will produce division in the Australian community.

       Funding of Children's Services
      </title>
      <para>
       To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The petition of certain citizens of the Shire of Caboolture situated in the Federal Division of Fisher, Queensland respectfully showeth:
      </para>
      <para>
       that the present Commonwealth funding for day care facilities for child care in the Shire of Caboolture is totally inadequate to meet the growing demands of the district which is one of the fastest growing areas in Queensland and Australia.
      </para>
      <para>
       that the funding for Aboriginal and migrant child care facilities is disproportionately high in comparison to growth areas such as Caboolture which are seriously disadvantaged under present Federal Government funding guidelines.
      </para>
      <para>
       That there is an apparent excessive number of places for child care funding in Canberra and the Australian Capital Territory, while there is a lack of these places in Caboolture, Queensland and other areas remote from the Capital.
      </para>
      <para>
       Your petitioners therefore humbly pray:
      </para>
      <para>
       1. That rapid growth areas such as the Shire of Caboolture be given special consideration in the allocation of funding.

       2. That such funding be made available at similar levels to that provided to migrant and Aboriginal communities.

         —This Government and this Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) have broken many promises made to Australians and to Australian families. They broke that well remembered promise not to introduce a capital gains tax; they broke that well remembered promise that interest rates were going to fall in 1985 and they have broken many other promises. The Prime Minister, by his posturing, his dodging and his equivocation, made it very clear today that he is on the brink of breaking yet another promise. Let me read from a statement made only a couple of years ago. It reads as follows:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        Government policy ties Australian petrol prices to the price of crude oil from Saudi Arabia. Any fall in the Saudi price must be passed on to Australian motorists in lower petrol prices.
       </para>
       <para>
        That was not my statement, it was not a statement made by the Opposition spokesman on resources and energy, it was not made by the Leader of the Australian consumer group; it was none other than a statement made by Paul Keating as the Opposition spokesman on minerals and energy. One could go back through the Hansard and through the political history books and there are enough promises from the Treasurer (Mr Keating) and the Prime Minister in their present and earlier capacities to cover every wall of the Lodge and Kirribilli House to boot on the subject of petrol prices. If ever a group of people was jammed on petrol prices, it is the Hawke Government because everywhere it went in opposition and everywhere it has been in government it has said that if the world price goes down the Australian consumer ought to get the benefit. Yet now, faced with the opportunity of passing on the benefit of a fall in the world price of oil to Australian consumers-the farmer, the small businessman and the Australian motorist-of giving Australian consumers the benefit of a 7c reduction, what is the Prime Minister going to do? He is going to cheat the Australian public of the benefit of the fall in the world price of oil; he is going to tear up all of the promises he has made and he is going to go running around the country Uriah Heap-like and he is going to say: `Oh, we can't really afford to do it. That promise we made you was all a ghastly mistake'. It is like the prediction he made a couple of weeks ago on Mike Carlton's radio program about the level of the Australian dollar.
       </para>
       <para>
        Apparently now, on 11 February, Prime Ministers do not make predictions about the Australian dollar, but on 24 January, less than a month ago, it was all right for him to say that the real value of the Australian dollar was about 72c to 75c. The problem is that when he made that statement it was not at 72c; immediately he made that statement confidence ebbed in the dollar, interest rates started edging up again and the Treasurer came storming back from his holidays and said: `For heaven's sake, will you shut up and stop making predictions about the future level of the Australian dollar because you will make a fool of yourself and you will have a very damaging effect on financial markets'. So now, very contrite, the Prime Minister says: `Oh, that promise was a mistake; that prediction was a mistake'. Over the next couple of weeks he is going to try to persuade the Australian public that all of the promises he made about petrol prices were a ghastly mistake. On 9 February 1983 during the 1983 election campaign He stated:
       </para>
       <para>
        Petrol prices will be immediately cut by about 3c per litre under a Federal Labor Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        That was a promise made by the then Leader of the Opposition. We heard nothing more about that. Mr Keating, the present Treasurer, the then spokesman on minerals and energy in 1979, then talked about the great petrol rip-off and how it had to be ended. We all remember his phrase about the establishment of a branch of the Taxation Office at every petrol bowser. Not only has he gladly embraced all of those branches, but he has gone forth and multiplied those branches. Having been given the opportunity to do something about them, what does he do? He runs like a dog from the promises that he, the Prime Minister and other Ministers made that, if the world price goes down, our price ought to go down. It is a very simple proposition that is going to be understood by the Australian public. It is going to be understood by every farmer, every small businessman and every motorist that if it is good enough for this mob to rip it off them when the price goes up, it is only fair that they get the benefit of any fall in the world price.
       </para>
       <para>
        I say to the Treasurer and to the Prime Minister that if they think they can talk the Australian public out of the logic of that, if they think they can sell the Australian public a bill of goods about it all being too difficult and about the revenue impact, they are not really going to get to first base. Which government used his money to underwrite the present levels of expenditure that we now have?

Mr Keating has been Treasurer of this country for three years and if it is good enough for him to claim credit for any good things about the economy at present, he has got to cop the blame for the problems that he has. He gets absolutely no credit for going out to the Australian community with some cock and bull story about it all being some kind of inherited problem. If the Treasurer had been smart and understood what was going to happen to world oil markets, he would not have jacked up expenditure so that now, in order to give the full benefit of the fall in the price of oil, he has a huge budgetary problem. If the Treasurer has a budgetary problem, it is his fault and nobody else's. He should not go crying to the Australian public, saying: `Please let us off this promise, please don't exact any political price out of our hide because we have a budgetary problem. We ask you to overlook the fact that we created the budgetary problem; we ask you to overlook the fact that we let expenditure rip; we ask you to overlook the fact that we promised things that we should not have promised, because we were trying to get elected'.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        That deceitful promise in December 1984 that interest rates would fall in 1985 is a promise that every home owner, farmer and small businessman literally spit out when they think of the interest rates they have to pay at the present time. There were other quite deceitful promises, so the Treasurer should not imagine that he can wriggle out of the commitment that he made on oil prices, because if ever anybody in this country has been identified with a commitment about reflecting falls in the world price of oil in domestic oil prices, it is the present Treasurer. He had more to say about that than anybody else and he is the person who will be held more accountable and punished more politically by the inevitable decision of the Government.
       </para>
       <para>
        The dogs are already barking, depending on who one talks to and what the version is. One version is that the Government will let the fall flow through to the domestic price, then put on an excise and say: `We let it flow through fully, but we will put on an excise'. I wonder, if that version happens, what the present Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations (Mr Willis) will have to say about it. On 14 December 1979, as shadow Treasurer, this is what he had to say about that particular version of what the Government might do:
       </para>
       <para>
        Petrol taxes are highly regressive, so this increase in petrol prices will be totally inequitable with the greatest burden falling on lower income earners.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is what the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations had to say about it. What will the Treasurer do about the impact on Australia's inflation rate of the failure to pass on the full fall in the world oil price? Does the world's greatest Treasurer not understand that our inflation rate is now double that of our major trading partners and treble the inflation rate of Japan? Does he not understand that this country now has the highest real interest rates in the Western world and our competitiveness has already been destroyed by the fact that we have the highest interest rates in the industrialised world and the worst level of interest rates since the late 1920s? What will he do about that situation? On top of that predicament, on top of our uncompetitiveness and on top of the lack of international confidence in our dollar, he will burden Australian producers with further uncompetitive imposts.
       </para>
       <para>
        If we do not get the benefit of the fall in the world price of oil and producers in other parts of the world get the benefit of that fall, our competitive position will be made even worse. What makes Australian farmers bitter at the present time is the fact that they are carrying burdens that no other farmers around the world are required to carry. If this fall in the world price of oil if not passed on to Australian farmers, and they are singled out for this kind of discriminatory treatment and kicked in the teeth again as they were with the Keating tax package, their already parlous position will be made even worse.
       </para>
       <para>
        It would be bad enough if this alone were the only thing being done to Australian primary producers, but it is not the only thing being done. At the moment, when they face their worst crisis for generations and the Prime Minister prattles and rabbits on about how he will try to do something about it, the Treasurer, who is now sitting at the table for the Government, is to bring in two taxation burdens that will do great damage to the Australian rural industry-a capital gains tax and his lunatic proposal on off-farm income. That particular proposal, which has been attacked and branded as lunatic by the Opposition from the moment it was announced by the Treasurer, has already had catastrophic effects on the value of rural properties.
       </para>
       <para>
        On top of that, what is the Government proposing to do? The Government is proposing to cheat the Australian farmer and the Australian consumer, and become the petrol cheat of 1986. The Government will cheat the entire Australian public of the full benefit of the fall in world price of oil. It will cry poor mouth and it will say: `We did not know that it was going to happen. You ought to understand'. No doubt the Government will say: `You should be sympathetic to the Government's predicament. You ought to understand the problem we have. We made a few promises too many; we wanted to get elected'. It wanted the Australian public to believe those promises and they did believe those promises. They believed that the Prime Minister would cut the price of fuel by 3c a litre. Many of them believed the Prime Minister when he said that the had planted the seed and he was going to reap the harvest of lower interest rates in 1985. Many of them believed the Prime Minister when he said: `I want to make it perfectly clear, in language that everybody will understand, that there will be no new capital gains tax'.
       </para>
       <para>
        So this Government, this Treasurer and this Prime Minister cannot duck the political odium that is theirs because of their breach of so many electoral promises. The Australian public has endured high fuel prices because the world price has been high and it has made sense that we price our fuel at the world level. Now that the world price is coming down, the Australian public demands the full benefit of the fall in that price. No amount of backing and filling or inventing of excuses by the world's greatest Treasurer will allow him to escape that political odium.
       </para>
       <para>
        I regard the promises that have been made by the Treasurer and the Government on this particular issue as the most iron clad, the most oft-repeated and the ones that will come home to haunt them over the weeks and months ahead. The failure to pass on the fall in the world price of oil and the failure to give to the Australian motorist and farmer the full benefit of it is an act that will damage the living standards and security of individual Australians and families.
       </para>
       <para>
        When one looks across the whole gamut of policies being followed by this Government, one finds again the again actions taken by the Government that are damaging the living standards of average Australians and their families. We find it with interest rates, taxation and petrol prices and in relation to the small business community and the farming community with the productivity deal. How on earth in all justice can the Government ask farmers, who will suffer a drop in their real incomes over the next couple of years, to cop a 3 per cent productivity claim? How on earth can the Government say to somebody who has an income of less than $5,000 a year: `You can pay 3 per cent out of your hide for a so-called productivity rise.'? That is the kind of injustice that the deal made by the Treasurer with the trade union movement of Australia has inflicted upon battling farmers and battling small businessmen. He will pay a great political price for it.

         —The Leader of the Opposition-his oiliness-had the distinction, in the five years that he was Treasurer, of lifting the oil revenue of the Commonwealth by 700 per cent. He took the tax on oil from the people of this country from $346m when he became Treasurer to $3,400m when he was defeated. This is the man who has the temerity, without any shame at all, to stand up and talk about the living standards of Australians. He even has the temerity to talk about the labour costs of farmers when his Government wrapped a $39 a week increase around their necks with the metal trades decision in 1982, in the middle of the drought. He should not lecture us about the effect of wage increases on farmers.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The fact is that when he became Treasurer in 1977 crude oil receipts were 1.4 per cent of Commonwealth receipts. When he left they were 9 per cent, or a 700 per cent increase. When the then Opposition talked about the dramatic lift in oil prices, the dramatic, brutal result on our inflation rate and our competitiveness, it was ignored by the former Treasurer. He knew that every time he took the easy resort to lazy oil money it went straight into the inflation rate, straight into wages, and destroyed our inflation rate and our competitiveness. Is it any wonder Australian manufacturing industry folded? Is it any wonder we were curtailed on world commodity markets as our competitiveness fell? Having taken the money and spent the lot, having addicted the Commonwealth Budget to oil revenue, the Leader of the Opposition now wants this Government simply to tear all of that expenditure out of the cloth of the Commonwealth's outlays. John Howard, Treasurer and oil money spender, now demands of this Government that overnight, without even giving the Government the courtesy of time to consider the issues, it tear out those outlays. When asked the question about where he would cut Commonwealth outlays he had this shockingly unprincipled answer:
       </para>
       <para>
        Well, that is a matter for the Government in detail to come up with and I don't intend now or in the immediate future to be detailing the alternative expenditure plans . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        In other words, he is saying: `It was all right for me, John Howard, to spend the money, to spend the ill gotten gains of the crude oil levy, but do not ask me where to cut the receipts. I spent it on my priorities but I will provide no priorities to you on where I would save it.' That is the Leader of the Opposition's proposition. That is the unprincipled, hypocritical proposition from the Leader of the Opposition. `I spent the $3 billion on my priorities, but I will not say where I would unspend it. That is a problem for this Government.' Do honourable members really think we are going to say: `Oh God, John Howard said that. We are mortally wounded'?
       </para>
       <para>
        The fact is that the deficit reductions in the Opposition's time never came out of the three or four months onerous expenditure cutting exercise that this Government has been involved in. The previous Government brought down deficits simply by throwing the oil money at them. It sat on its backside and chucked the oil money at the deficits and they fell. The other thing it did was to cheat on the outlays by moving Australia Post and Telecom out of the Budget so that it could fudge its outlay figures. It never did any decent outlay savings in its life. It left us with a Budget deficit which no one ever expected we would need to deal with, at a time when the oil revenue had stopped growing. It was able to reduce Budget deficits with this massive growth in oil revenue. When the oil revenue stopped growing it gave us first of all a negative moment in oil revenues and then the biggest fiscal deficit of any in the Commonwealth's history. That is what this Government inherited, yet the Opposition has the hide to talk about oil revenue.
       </para>
       <para>
        We will make up our minds about oil revenue, as the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) said, when we consider all the issues appropriately in the Cabinet context. What really makes me sick is the tone of this proposition that damage will be done to Australian living standards. The hypocrisy of that, coming from the man who put 300,000 families into poverty through unemployment-they have a decent old living standard on the dole!-and from the person who says that he has opposed all wage indexations since March 1983. He talks about the damage that will be done to living standards and the security of Australians and their families by not passing back 7c litre, or whatever it is, for petrol, but it is okay to say: `Do not pay them any wage increases, refuse them wage indexation, never give anybody an even break, take the money from them, let inflation rip their pay packets apart, do not pay them indexation. We, the Opposition, the Liberal Party of Australia and the National Party of Australia, oppose all those increases.'
       </para>
       <para>
        Let me say this: Indexation since March 1983 is worth $54 a week to the Australians those opposite supposedly worry about, to those families' living standards. It is $54 a week they would not have if those opposite had had their way in opposing wage indexation. They cry crocodile tears about 7c a litre, or $3.50 a week I think, was the figure mentioned in Question Time, in the Opposition's own shonky fashion. That is after it said it would oppose the tax cuts. The Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Bennelong said: `If it came to a choice between lower receipts and tax cuts and a lower Budget deficit, there should be a lower Budget deficit. We should not give the tax cuts.' So the $7.60 we gave to everyone in the work force in 1984 would have been opposed too. The Opposition is saying: `We oppose the tax cuts; we oppose wage indexation'. Taking the $54 a week for wage indexation and $7.60 for tax cuts, wage earners are $60 a week better off. The Opposition says: `We oppose all those, but we have a puny motion about living standards-a piece of hypocrisy about living standards-and about oil tax of 7c a litre'. Opposition members are a joke. Do they think there will be any moral support for their proposition while they hold those positions? Nobody will take any notice. The Opposition opposes Medicare. The poorest of people, families, who could not even insure themselves against sickness, and there were lots of them who could not afford to pay $30 and $40 a week to insure themselves against sickness, are now protected. The Opposition opposes that. It opposes wage indexation, tax cuts, Medicare. As if the Liberal Party ever did care about ordinary Australians! It never did care. All it ever thought about was looking after its own skin and the people it represented.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Deputy Leader of the National Party talked about the bush. I will tell him about the bush and his overvalued exchange rate. He was a member of a government which kept the exchange rate overvalued because it had no wages policy, no anti-inflation policy. We have given Australian farmers $1,500m this year in Australian dollar receipts on their agricultural proceeds, and they would not have got that without the floating dollar and without the onerous burden that float has put on this Government. Despite the fall in world commodity prices there is $1,500m more in the pockets of Australian farmers than they would otherwise have received. What about the 1982-83 drought? What about 1981-82? Honourable members opposite robbed Australian farmers of $3 billion in two years by keeping the exchange rate overvalued. They robbed Australian farmers of $1,500m a year by keeping their rotten exchange rate policy. Why did they keep that? They kept it because they never had the guts to stand up to Malcolm Fraser and they never told him to get a wages policy.
       </para>
       <para>
        Honourable members opposite should not lecture us about farmers. We have done two things. Not only are farmers $1,500m better off than they otherwise would have been; as well as that we have reduced their costs by $500m a year-I stress a year-by giving them a wage and cost and inflation structure that is less than half the one honourable members opposite had. We have wage movements of around 6 per cent. In 1982-83 they had wage movements of 14 per cent after giving the metal trades $39 a week in the middle of a drought. So honourable members opposite in the National Party should not talk about farmers. They have bludged on farmers all their lives. They have told farmers they represent them while they have come down here and added protection by way of tariffs for manufacturing industry. They supported an overvalued exchange rate which ripped farmers' incomes to pieces. That is what they did. They supported a rotten, corrupt inflation policy which gave farmers a 14 per cent wage structure while they were battling like hell on their farms to make a go of it. So honourable members opposite should not tell us about farmers. In every respect, when we look at the living standards of Australians-be it in wages, be it in after-tax income, be it in lower inflation that is not ripping at and raping pay packets and savings-people are much better off, immeasurably better off, under this Government.

        The Opposition has brought in this proposition, worrying about fuel prices, when the present Leader of the Opposition (Mr Howard) is the member of this Parliament who lifted oil taxes by 700 per cent and spent the lot-on Burdekin dams, on airports, on all sorts of pork barrelling around the countryside. He did everything but give tax cuts. He used the money for everything but tax relief. He took the money with a smug look on his face. He rammed the costs right into the Australian wage and price structure, right into the Australian inflation rate-he took Australia's inflation rate back to 11 1/2 per cent-and now he is in here today talking about what the Opposition said at the time. Of course we said that he should not have grabbed the money at the pace he did. He took the rate from $2 to $30 a barrel in 18 months. He thought: `Let's sock the mugs. They'll never know. They'll just have to cop it'. In 1983 they would not cop it any more. They got rid of the previous Government, and they will stay rid of it.
       </para>
       <para>
        As far as this Government is concerned, as the Prime Minister said, we will look at all the issues in respect of oil pricing. We realise what is happening in the world oil price markets. But I just make this point: This Government has been responsible for carrying the onerous burden of this enormous problem of fiscal policy while at the same time providing tax relief of the only genuine kind in living memory. To have the Opposition talking in this Parliament about living standards while it would say to the work force it should have no wage indexation, while it would not have paid the 3.8 per cent last November, while it would not have agreed to the $7.60 tax cut in 1984 really is nothing but a cruel hoax and a joke. It is really deluding itself if it thinks that anybody out there is fooled by this. The greatest joke of all is today's report in the Australian Financial Review of the Leader of the Opposition saying he will not detail the expenditure cuts. He spent the money; now he wants this Government to unspend it, but he will not say where. He has got no guts. He will not do the right thing. We reject this proposition absolutely for the humbug which it is.

         —Mr Deputy Speaker, you would hardly know it from the ranting and raving in the response of the Treasurer (Mr Keating), but all we are asking is that this Government meet its stated commitments. It has made commitments to give tax cuts in 1986 and 1987. It has made a commitment to move petrol prices up and down with world prices. We ask it to meet that commitment. It will not have met that commitment unless in March there is a 7c a litre drop in the price of petrol. It is perfectly simple, 7c a litre at the pump in March or this Government will not have met its public commitments. In addition, if it does not do that it will not have acted sensibly on economic policy. Indeed, if we go to the stated economic policy of the Government-which is, under the accord, wage indexation, a reduction in inflation-not only is it essential in fairness to the Australian community to pass on the 7c a litre at the pump; it is also essential to use that to reduce inflation at a time when our inflation rate is double that of our trading partners and rising.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        There are two things we are asking and they are perfectly simple: For the Government to meet its stated commitments on tax and to meet its stated commitment on petrol prices. By doing those two things at the very same time the Government will be assisting its own economic policies. All I can say is that I am astonished. I must say also that the cat is clearly out of the bag because the Treasurer and the Government obviously have decided to steal at least some and possibly all of that 7c. There is no explanation for 15 minutes of ranting and raving about total nonsense other than that the Government has already decided to grab the 7c from the consumer. It has done that already. We have seen this sort of thing before. Before the 1983 election the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) said unequivocally: `There will be no capital gains tax'. Before the 1984 election, when the Prime Minister was asked about tax, he would not answer. We have recently had two State elections and we have had by-elections in two States. During those election campaigns we put it fairly and squarely to the Prime Minister: `What is your intention on petrol tax? Are you going to bring down petrol prices in accordance with the fall in world prices?'. He dodged the question. It was a repeat of the pattern we had seen in the 1984 election campaign. Of course, immediately after the 1984 election it became absolutely clear that the Prime Minister had no intention of meeting his commitment on capital gains tax. Certainly in this area it was obvious from the way he dodged the questions in the by-elections and State campaigns that the Government had already made up its mind to renege on its promises on oil prices.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is no excuse for this. The world's greatest Treasurer would have known without doubt in September when he made his tax cut promises, as everybody knew, that oil prices around the world were going to fall in 1986. The Government knew that. In fact, Senator Gareth Evans, the Minister who passes for the Minister for Resources and Energy in this Government, in April last year had to explain what for him was an embarrassing increase in the price of petrol when the value of the dollar changed. The dollar dropped and prices went up. The dollar dropped 25 per cent over a year and, of course, prices went up. Senator Evans was asked on the Australian Broadcasting Corporation PM program in April last year:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . but if and when the value of the dollar improves, will you drop the pump price of petrol in Australia?

        Sooner or later the dollar is going to float back to more realistic levels. Although we were overvalued on the world market, I don't think anybody seriously thinks that the present level of the dollar is an accurate reflection of our economic strength.
       </para>
       <para>
        That was quite interesting in April anyway, because the dollar took another dive after he said this:
       </para>
       <para>
        It will float back in due course-
       </para>
       <para>
        This is a Minister floating all over the place. He continued:
       </para>
       <para>
        and when that happens, obviously consumers will get the benefit of that in terms of reduced prices at the pump and the Government will lose the additional revenue that flows from yesterday's decision.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is what Senator Evans said in April last year. It was well known what the Government's commitment on pump prices was, right at the time the Cabinet was leading up to the September statement, right through the ridiculous Tax Summit, right up to the September promise to give us tax cuts in 1986 and 1987. If the Treasurer, who has now scuttled off into his hole and will not listen to what is being said-he is probably listening on the blower in his office-did not know, when he was making Cabinet submissions on tax policy in September of last year, that there was going to be a fall in oil prices he had not talked to anybody. If he did not know that, very clearly he is not only not the world's greatest Treasurer but also the world's most hopeless Treasurer. Everybody knew that petrol prices around the world would fall this year. They had to be factored into the Government's equations. Of course, when the predicted falls started to occur and the Prime Minister was asked `Will you do what Senator Evans said; will you do what's in your policy; will you give us the 7c a litre at the pump reduction which we deserve, which we need to be internationally competitive and which the farmers desperately need?' he said: `We might have some revenue problems. It might cost us $1.7 billion extra'. If the Government did not know that when it was doing its tax package the whole tax package was a fraud. The whole damned set of promises that it put out was a fraudulent set of promises. The Government must have known then. Presumably, it had no intention of either meeting the promises or of reducing petrol prices at the pump. It cannot have it both ways. Either way, its statement of 19 September last year was fraudulent.
       </para>
       <para>
        Why is this a desperately serious matter, quite apart from the cheating of the consumer and the breaking of promises? It is an extraordinarily sensitive issue because we are at a stage where we are uncompetitive on world markets. We have not done sufficient things to take advantage of the devaluation. Our inflation rate is rising again. It is 8.2 per cent, and rising, and that is twice the average rate of our trading partners. Our interest rates are 20 per cent. Under the accord, all those traded areas of the economy which have to compete internationally will have wage rises of about 10 per cent this year. There will be the discounted wage rise of 2.2 per cent in April and an increase of 3 per cent if the Australian Council of Trade Unions deal on productivity goes through in July. That will impact in full on traded parts of the economy-the ones that have to compete internationally. They will get all of that in July. Other parts might not but they will. Because of rising inflation and full indexation there will be a further 5 per cent increase in October. That adds up to a wage increase of 10 per cent over the course of this year. Heaven forbid!
       </para>
       <para>
        If Australia is in a position in which it has rising inflation, if it looks forward to a 10 per cent wage increase in the traded areas of the economy and if it has an indexation policy which will pass those through, prices will go up. They will go further into wages. We are at the very point where it is essential to bring about a one-time reduction in inflation in order to break this cycle. The Government can do this by meeting its own commitments and promises. It does not have to go beyond those. If any belt tightening is needed at the time of the Budget surely that was foreseen when the Government made its tax statement in September. If it was not foreseen, if it was not factored in, the Treasurer acted fraudulently in putting forward the September statement. He would have to have done so if it was not factored in.
       </para>
       <para>
        We are asking for a 7c a litre reduction at the pump in March to bring the price down in line with falls in oil prices. We are asking for the full tax cuts that were promised. We are asking for everything that was promised on 19 September together with the promise to reduce the price of petrol. The Government must have known all the factors that were going into 1986 at the time it made its promises. I ask everybody to watch the pumps in early March. If the price of petrol is not down by 7c a litre at every pump this Government stands condemned.

         —Members of the Opposition do not want to listen to any of the facts. The facts are that in 1977-78 Commonwealth oil revenue was $476m, but by 1982-83 it was $3,486m. So the level of hypocrisy which we have witnessed here today is astounding. Who was responsible for the erosion of the living standards of ordinary Australians? It was the members of the Opposition, led by the present Leader of the Opposition, who was then the Treasurer. Who pushed inflation into double figures and what impact did that have on the Australian family? Who milked Australians and their families for this $3,486m yet still allowed the deficit to blow out to over $9 billion? Who at the same time also managed the enormous feat to put 10 per cent of Australians on the dole? What did the coalition do with this massive amount of money in the taxation coffers? Did the coalition hand it back to the Australian family? No. Did the coalition give it to people in increased welfare payments? No. The coalition frittered it away on every pork-barrelling exercise it could think of in its desperate effort to try to stay in government. It had an attitude of `spend now and pay later'. That was the attitude of the Leader of the Opposition when he was Treasurer. That was the attitude of the coalition Government. That was the attitude that brought the Australian economy to its knees. Here today we see this attitude repeated. The honourable member for Bennelong and the honourable member for Mackellar (Mr Carlton) are not prepared to outline their offsetting expenditure cuts. All they are interested in doing is grandstanding. They want their cake and they want to eat it too. That is what they see as the role of the Opposition. That is why they will continue in opposition. Until they start to outline what their options are the Australian people will not see the Opposition as an alternative government. It is all very well to stand up in this House and call for all the goodies. I used to do it when I was in opposition too. One gets up and calls for all the goodies but one never outlines what it will cost and what other cuts have to be made. One cannot have one's cake and eat it too. One cannot call for all the goodies and never suffer any of the costs involved.

        The honourable member for Bennelong was irresponsible when he was the Treasurer and he is irresponsible now. He is running away from the hard decisions. Members of the Opposition are economic cinderellas. They live in fairyland. What we are seeing today is the Opposition crying crocodile tears for Australian families. It opposed tax cuts last year, it opposes tax cuts this year and it will oppose tax cuts next year. It does not want tax cuts for the Australian family. The Opposition opposed full wage indexation. Although it advocates real wage cuts for Australian wage and salary earners, cries about the standards of the Australian family. It also opposes the universal health care system and a universal superannuation cover. The Opposition does not care about the living standards of the Australian family. In fact, the reality is that the Opposition when in government set family living standards nosediving. It is the Hawke Labor Government that has arrested this free fall. It is the Hawke Labor Government that is beginning to lift the standards of the Australian family. What does the Opposition do? It just barks, barks and barks and presents no alternative policy.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government is considering a range of options following the fall in world prices. The Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) and the Treasurer have already said that this matter is under consideration by the Cabinet. Of course, it is a complex issue and a number of points have to be considered. One is that the world oil market is very fluid at present and it is important that the Government makes the correct decision for the long term benefit of all Australians, and that is what is critical. The current reduction in prices could well be temporary as it is clear that the strategy of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries is to force non-OPEC producers to cut their production in the interest of maintenance of profitable prices. To follow world prices blindly in these circumstances could adversely affect Australia's conservation and exploration effort.
       </para>
       <para>
        If we compare the Australian level of petroleum excise with that of other industrialised nations we will find that, with the exception of North America, Australia has the lowest petrol excise of Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development members. The excise in Australia is 10c a litre compared with an average of 30c to 40c a litre in Western Europe rising to 80c to 90c a litre in Italy and France. They are the facts that the Opposition just wants to ignore. It is the Hawke Labor Government that has a record of assisting the standards of the Australian family. We saw a decline in family living standards during the time when the previous Government was in power. It is useless for the Opposition to stand up here and present hypothetical assertions about what should be done when the previous Government was never prepared to make any tough decisions. It continued to spend and the Opposition continues to live in its own fairy world as economic Cinderellas.

        Although I have acted with goodwill in this respect, I must say that I cannot see that the amendment improves what we were about originally. The Opposition, with the concurrence of another party in the Senate, feels that the rights of a person would be affected if we were to do what was intended, that is, to make it very clear that section 69 (3) of the Judiciary Act, which has been in force since about 1903, need not remain because a number of applications to courts and judges are no longer appropriate in that legal aid is available through the respective legal aid commissions.

The judge was quite understandably critical and said that he really should not be trying to determine administrative matters such as whether a person was with or without adequate means. In the particular case in question, it was alleged that the person seeking legal aid was in fact able to gain adequate support from other members of his family. I think the situation was accentuated when the person concerned continued to drive to the court in a Rolls-Royce. That created some public disquiet. However, legal aid was provided in the sense that a figure was eventually agreed on.
       </para>
       <para>
        The point I am trying to make is that every person who faces trial is entitled to legal aid when he or she does not have adequate means of paying for a defence. The amendment leaves such provision in sub-section (3) but proposes that it state: `. . . the Judge shall certify this to the Attorney-General, who may if he thinks fit'-that is, having had a certification that a person is without adequate means to provide a defence for himself-`cause arrangements to be made . . . or refer the matter to such legal aid authorities as the Attorney-General considers appropriate'.
       </para>
       <para>
        I do not argue against the Senate suggesting this amendment because it feels that otherwise a right is taken away. However, under this provision the courts will receive a number of applications from people who say: `I will go off to court and get an order from a judge'. The judge will then have to work out whether that person is without adequate means of support, when that is normally done by the legal aid commissions. The matter would then be referred to the Attorney-General, who in turn would have to refer it to the Legal Aid Commission.
       </para>
       <para>
        We spend a great amount of time and effort on the legal aid commissions; we give substantial funds to them and they do their duty very well. However, I can see what might happen, and in fact it has already happened in the Edwards case last December. (Quorum formed) The amendment certainly meets the spirit of what has always been intended in that there would always be a legal aid commission to ascertain whether a person is without adequate means of support to defend an offence. However, what will happen now is that a person will be able to go to a court without going to a legal aid commission. The courts may well find themselves bedevilled by a number of applications. A person will go along to a court and say: `I am here, I have not got any adequate means of support, and I want an order'. The judge would probably agree with that request and an order would be made that the Attorney-General make provision or refer the matter to the appropriate legal aid authority, and that would be the Legal Aid Commission.
       </para>
       <para>
        We are trying to regularise the system and to prevent the courts from having too much work in the sense of their doing the work that the Legal Aid Commission is now doing. A precedent was set in the Edwards case last December when a person went along to a court and said: `I want legal aid' but that person had not gone to the Legal Aid Commission. It will be an embarrassment for the courts to have to deal with these matters when they could be dealt with by the Legal Aid Commission.
       </para>
       <para>
        I endeavoured to persuade the Opposition not to proceed with this amendment, which was moved at the time the Bill was debated in the House of Representatives. I was not successful, and the Bill has now been returned from the Senate on the basis that the law be let stand but that provision be made to allow for reference to alternative legal aid authorities. In a nutshell, I am not here to argue the matter any more. I think this amendment is counter-productive because of the time and effort that the courts will now have to spend in dealing with applications from people who have no obligation at all to go to the Legal Aid Commission. They will merely go to a court and get an order, and I can see that that will be encouraged. If the courts find themselves overwhelmed with these sorts of applications, it might be appropriate for this House, and the Senate particularly, to reassess the situation. I accept the amendment on the basis that there is a concern that the courts ought to look at the question of legal aid rather than the administrative area. I think that will cause some difficulty, but I accept the amendment given to us by the Senate.

         —I am glad to accept the expression of goodwill from the Attorney-General (Mr Lionel Bowen), even though I feel that the way in which his arguments were put did not really live up to that expression. He seems to be concerned about the way in which this amendment will operate. Listening to what he has had to say, one can only assume that it is an amendment the Government was not really in a position to accept, but the Attorney-General has said he will accept it and he does accept it. I suppose that must mean that he sees more merit in having it on the books than in not having it on the books. So at least we have got that far in terms of agreement.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The Attorney-General has expressed the fear that under this amendment the courts again will be bogged down by applications for legal aid. Let me remind the Committee of what the amendment we propose to section 69 (3) of the Judiciary Act will do. What the Government proposed was to get rid of section 69 (3) in its entirety. Under sub-section (3) courts are given power, on the trial of Commonwealth offences, to make certain provisions for the defence of people. Let me read the relevant part of the sub-section, which states:
       </para>
       <para>
        If it be found to the satisfaction of the Justice or Judge that such person-
       </para>
       <para>
        that is, an accused person-
       </para>
       <para>
        is without adequate means to provide defence for himself, and that it is desirable in the interests of justice that such an appointment should be made, the Justice or Judge shall certify this to the Attorney-General, who may if he thinks fit thereupon cause arrangements to be made for the defence of the accused person.
       </para>
       <para>
        So we have these ingredients: We have an offence charged; we have a judge who hears an application, and he has to be satisfied that the accused person is without adequate means to provide defence for himself, and he has also to be satisfied that it is in the interests of justice that an appointment of counsel should be made, in which event he so certifies.
       </para>
       <para>
        The last time we were debating the Judiciary Amendment Bill the Attorney-General was complaining that that sub-section in effect left him with no discretion. He said that everything should be handed over to the legal aid authorities, that they were the answer to all these problems, and that the courts simply should not be involved. As I understand him, that is what he is saying now. What we are saying is that of course there is a legal aid system in this country but it is nowhere near as comprehensive as this Government sometimes suggests that it is. We say that there may well be cases, and that these cases should be guarded against, where legal aid is refused, where a person is accused, where a person is on trial for a Commonwealth offence, where that person does not have adequate means to provide for a defence and where the interests of justice require that there be a lawyer to defend that person. That is the situation that we seek to protect. We did it by an amendment which, I am glad to say, the Australian Democrats in another place have supported.
       </para>
       <para>
        By that amendment, which is the amendment before the Committee today which was moved by me on 13 November 1985, where a judge comes to the conclusion that it is necessary to provide for the defence of someone because that person does not have adequate means to provide for his own defence and that therefore it is desirable in the interests of justice there should be an appointment of someone to defend him that judge can certify to the Attorney-General who, under the alternative we offered, may, if he thinks fit, thereupon cause arrangements to be made for the defence of the accused person; or the Attorney-General can refer the matter to such legal aid authorities as he considers appropriate.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is, I should think, no more than raising spectres to say that courts will be bogged down by these sorts of applications. If a person is on trial and cannot afford a lawyer to defend himself the first thing he is going to do if he has any sense at all is to apply to the legal aid authorities. There may be cases where, for whatever reason, an accused person will decide that he will chance his luck with the court. These circumstances would be exceptions because it would be an extremely stupid, unwise and venturesome accused person who would not want to get a defending counsel engaged at the earliest possible opportunity. Most-the overwhelming number of such people-would want to go to the ordinary legal aid system to try to get it that way.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Attorney-General provided the reason for this amendment the last time we debated this matter. He told us that all of the 10 applications made in 1986 were made by defendants who had previously applied for legal aid and who had been refused. What we say is that a supervisory role should be maintained for the courts. We do not assume that the courts will be involved in a day to day investigation of people's finances but we do say that courts are, by the nature of the business they have to look after, by the experience of the judges, better placed than anybody else to determine whether the interests of justice require that a lawyer be appointed to defend somebody who is on a Commonwealth charge.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Attorney-General has shown some concern for the administration of justice. At Question Time we heard him talking about the Chamberlain case and the concern that he had with the possible irregularities in relation to that case-the concern that he had that the outcome may not have been a just one. I welcome his concern generally for the administration of justice, but I think that he allowed himself to be too easily influenced by the departmental view that a nice neat amendment should be brought in to take away from the courts any power to exercise a supervisory role in the interests of justice where an accused person comes before a court and says: `I am accused. I could go to gaol. I do not have adequate means; I cannot afford lawyers. The interests of justice require that I should have a lawyer'. In those cases I would have thought that the Attorney-General would agree that such a person should have a lawyer even if the legal aid authorities have refused him.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am sure he is not going to tell us that the legal aid authorities cannot err, just as I will not tell him that the courts cannot err. There will be cases where both make mistakes. However, to retain a supervisory role is an added safeguard in the interests of poor accused persons. Certainly, it is not one-I entirely agree with the Attorney-General-to be abused by rich accused persons. If abuses take place it is up to the courts to meet those abuses. Therefore in sum we welcome his acceptance of the amendment and we welcome its passage through this chamber.

         —I thank the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Spender). I pick up the point which he has a tendency to think represents the position. He says that a person who has been refused legal aid is entitled to go here. I will not quibble about that. However, the point I make is that people will now be able to go to the court without having any refusal of legal aid first. I think that will be a problem for the court. However, the test of it will be in its performance in the next 12 months. I am sure that the honourable gentleman will agree it is possible that the courts could come and say that they are bedevilled with applications by people who do not go anywhere near the legal aid commissions but who say `We are penniless' and that the courts will have to make orders, spend a lot of time working out whether the person has means or not and then send them to me. I in turn must then make arrangements.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        In the cases where legal aid commissions have declined in the past to give legal aid-something which the honourable gentleman quite fairly adverted to-it was not that they refused legal aid at all but refused it on the basis of quantum-the amount sought. The honourable member will find that in most cases it was a matter of listening for hours to tapes; it was a question of what one could afford to spend. From recollection, in the 10 cases concerned I was talking about looking at individual costs of $200,000 in some instances. No judge would ever conduct a trial with an accused not being represented. I am sure that the honourable gentleman would agree with that. However, the issue is what is fair and reasonable in the provision of legal aid.
       </para>
       <para>
        It does not always follow that the accused is entitled to get whatever counsel he wants at whatever seniority he feels is required. It is a question of taxpayers' money, to the extent now of about $90m, being devoted to legal aid and a fair share being given to the accused. I do not want to delay the chamber. I accept the view that the honourable gentleman is putting. He and I would both agree that we might find that as a result of this amendment courts are being cluttered up by applications from people who have gone nowhere near legal aid offices. These are the people he has said have been refused legal aid. In the Edwards case no application was even made; however, it went to the court. We will continue to have that problem because the way the section is worded at present everybody can go off to the court first and then to the legal aid office. I was merely making the point that the legal aid commissions have a duty. In fact they are representative of the profession in the need to guarantee that nobody is denied legal aid. I would have thought that that would have been sufficient. As it turns out it is not. I accept the amendment.

It would be an extraordinarily unusual case that where there had been a grant of legal aid the court would then entertain a quibble whether a few dollars more should be awarded.

       This situation arises as a result of amendments moved in the Senate. Briefly, the amendments to be approved by the Committee are as follows: The amendment to clause 5 is a Government amendment which ensures that an election completed in December 1985 in relation to the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Board is valid for the purpose of appointing a staff-elected director. The amendment to clause 5 is technical and became necessary because of the time taken for passage of the Bill which was introduced in the 1985 autumn sittings. It was a purely technical amendment and, as I indicated, was moved by the Government.
      </para>
      <para>
       The second amendment is an Opposition amendment to repeal section 116 (2) of the Broadcasting and Television Act which imposed a five-year ban on televising a dramatisation of any political matter. The Government does not oppose this amendment as it reflects a recommendation of the report of the Joint Select Committee on Electoral Reform. The Government has previously indicated that it would put forward such an amendment in another piece of legislation and therefore we do not oppose that amendment.
      </para>
      <para>
       The third amendment relates to section 100 (6) of the Act. This is an Opposition amendment to introduce a 60-day time limit on section 100 (6) of the Broadcasting and Television Act within which the Department of Health may approve or disapprove the text of an advertisement relating to medication. The Minister for Health (Dr Blewett) may speak on that matter. But at this stage as far as the Government is concerned the position is no different from what it was when the legislation first came into this House. We do not see any reason for this amendment. In fact, the amendment as moved by the Opposition could well cause considerable problems which could affect appeal powers of interest groups. However, we do not propose at this stage to oppose the amendment because we do not want to delay the Bill as a whole. In relation to the matter that I have mentioned, namely, that this amendment could affect the appeal powers of interest groups with regard to this section, the matter can be further clarified at some stage in the future in a statute law (miscellaneous provisions) Bill. Because of the necessity at this stage to pass the Bill we will not oppose the amendment. I foreshadow that it is the intention at a later date, by way of a statute law (miscellaneous provisions) Bill, to raise this matter again in some detail.

        —The Opposition, needless to say, supports the motion moved by the Minister for Communications (Mr Duffy). We, of course, were responsible for two of the three matters that are now before the Committee. I will speak only to the third of those matters-that is, the one concerning the amendment moved by Senator Puplick which deletes the section limiting the dramatisation of material. I refer honourable members to the remarks made by Senator Puplick on 29 November, as recorded at page 2621 and following pages in the Senate Hansard, when he pointed out that there are still some absurdities in the Act, in spite of the amendment which the Minister has now moved. In respect of section 116 in particular, I point out that the section as it is now worded states:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       The Commission or a licensee shall not broadcast or televise a dramatisation of any political matter which is then current or was current at any time during the last 5 preceding years.
      </para>
      <para>
       Of course, each of us now knows that that was designed just after World War II when a Labor government then resented some of the material which was being used by the fledgling Liberal Party. The history of that section is set out in some quite important documents which were incorporated into the Senate Hansard of the date I have mentioned at page 2626 and following pages. I shall not recite what is contained in those documents, except to say that, not only have we matured as a nation and can cope with dramatisation of matters such as occurred then, but also, of course, we have the Max Gillies Show, Mike Carlton's puppets and various other forms of satire which are very close to dramatisation. So we feel that a responsible electorate can soon judge those who are dramatising events which are current or which have occurred within the last five years. Therefore, we do not need a provision of this nature.
      </para>
      <para>
       I would like to lend some personal support to the views that Senator Puplick set out regarding section 64 of the Act. I draw the Minister's attention to that section, which states:
      </para>
      <para>
       Subject to this Act, the Commission shall broadcast or televise free of charge from all the national broadcasting stations or national television stations, or from such of them as the Minister specifies, any matter the broadcasting or televising of which is directed by the Minister in writing as being in the national interest.
      </para>
      <para>
       I know the philosophy of the Minister at the table-and I have a similar one-that is, that the Australian Broadcasting Corporation ought to be as autonomous as possible and ought to be accountable to this Parliament through the Board which is appointed by the Government. On this occasion that Board was appointed in consul- tation with the Opposition. I would have thought that this Minister would be most unlikely ever to use section 64 to give a direction to the ABC about what he or the Government thought was in the national interest. If anyone were to do so, I would have thought it would perhaps be done by a resolution of this Parliament, but even that procedure is hazardous unless it is a bipartisan process. My instinctive reaction when looking at that section is to say that it also is now outmoded and ought to be reviewed. I simply draw that point to the Minister's attention. We most firmly support each of the three amendments.

        —I rise to support my colleague the honourable member for Goldstein (Mr Macphee) and to explain, in very brief terms, why we were moved to suggest this amendment in relation to advertising for pharmaceutical products. One of the problems that confronts the health industry is the administration under this Government of the Department of Health. We are inundated with complaints from pharmacists of delays in paying their bills which are submitted to the Department for drugs supplied under the pharmaceutical benefits scheme. The Pharmpay scheme has led to enormous delays for pharmacists and, in addition, the cost of medicare is out of control. Medical benefits payments are substantially over budget. One of the reasons is that again the Minister for Health (Dr Blewett) and the Department have not stepped on fraud and overservicing, which continue to be a problem in the delivery of health services in this country. The administration of the Department is deficient in a number of areas. Manufacturers of pharmaceutical products wish to advertise those products within the law. In order to be able to advertise those products they are required to obtain the approval of the Commonwealth Department of Health. Section 100 (6) of the Australian Broadcasting and Television Act states:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       A licensee shall not broadcast or televise an advertisement relating to a medicine unless the text of the proposed advertisement has been approved by the Director-General of Health . . .
      </para>
      <para>
       We were approached by members of the pharmaceutical manufacturing industry. They explained that, in some cases, there were undue delays in obtaining that approval. A voluntary code has been proposed and, in fact, applied. It has been proposed by the broadcasting industry and applied by the Department of Health. Unfortunately, whilst the code suggests a 10-day approval time for applications for advertisements, that is not stuck to. In response to my suggestion when I first moved this amendment the Minister said: `Well, that is not true. Ninety per cent of the cases are approved within 10 days; 10 per cent of the cases are not because of the intervention of holidays, Christmas and other things'. That is just patently false. The complaints we have had are not in relation to some period over Christmas or any other holiday period; they are delays in the administration of his Department. Therefore, we were forced to move for this time limit which prescribes a time in which the Department of Health must make a decision on the application.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Minister also said: `Oh, well, we haven't had any complaints. No pharmaceutical manufacturer has complained about the delays in approval for advertisements'. Later on he said: `During the year I did have a complaint, but not from a pharmaceutical manufacturer'. We are not told who made the complaint, but he has had complaints. Nevertheless he said he got his private secretary to ring up the Federation of Australian Radio Broadcasters to ascertain its view, which was that the voluntary code was working well. I agree with that and so do the pharmaceutical manufacturers. The code is working well. The problem is that the Department is delaying approvals under the code. In fact the Government is supporting the case we have put up that the voluntary code is working well. Applications made under that code are in accordance with the code and there should not be these long three and four-month delays. Therefore we have been forced to move a 60-day time limit to ensure that pharmaceutical manufacturers are fairly dealt with by the Department of Health.
      </para>
      <para>
       When we moved that amendment the Government opposed it in this House. However, as it has been forced by numbers in the Senate, where this amendment was carried, it now accepts the amendment because it has no alternative. I accept the suggestion by the Minister for Communications (Mr Duffy) that some consequential amendment of which we are not aware at this stage may be required. Certainly we would only be too willing to look at consequential amendments which may be required as a result of the passing of this amendment. We believe that the administration of the Department of Health ought to be improved. We are concerned that pharmacists are facing substantial delays in reimbursement under the Pharmpay scheme and we are concerned about maladministration in the fraud and overservicing section. Fraud and overservicing remain rampant. Medical benefits payments are substantially overbudgeted, as I have suggested. We are also concerned that in the area of advertising undue delays have disadvantaged pharmaceutical manufacturers. We have had an opportunity to do something about this area. We have moved an amendment and we have forced the Government to accept it. In government we will move in the other areas to correct the maladministration as well.

        —This amendment has been rightly described by my colleague Senator Walsh as the sleazebag amendment. He pointed out, quite clearly, that the only reason for this amendment being brought forward is that some particular vested interests-he described them as either spiv sleazebags or snake oil merchants-that hang around the Liberal Party have been lobbying Opposition members on this matter. (Quorum formed) With my colleagues here, it gives me a chance to repeat the accusation of Senator Walsh that this is simply a sleazebag amendment; that is, it had no justification at the time it was first moved and was completely unsubstantiated in argument. In fact we have heard nothing this evening to repeat the argument or to reinforce it in any way. In fact, the honourable member for Barker (Mr Porter) completely refused to meet my challenge on the last occasion. I quoted specifically from the Federation of Australian Radio Broadcasters. This was its comment on his amendment:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       In response to this morning's telex I confirm that to the best of our knowledge there have been no significant delays or problems associated with the Department's administration of section 106 of the Broadcasting and Television Act.
      </para>
      <para>
       Interestingly enough, today he has made no reference to the people who know about how this scheme has been operating, but he has come along here quite prepared to make these unsubstantiated charges about the administration of the Department of Health in an area where the people who deal with the Department are totally confident about the way it has been operating. As I have said, his ill-conceived amendment will cause some further concern. It will make appeals by public interest groups more difficult, but no doubt that was intended in the interests of his friends, and we will have to repair the damage he has done. As it is important to get this measure through, we will accept this amendment at this stage. At the first opportunity, when a general Bill is introduced, we will correct the defects of the amendment.

       (1) Has his attention been drawn to reports in the Age, of 14 March 1985, that the Victorian Pay-roll Tax Commissioner is claiming $47,644 from the Reserve Bank for low-interest housing loans provided to its employees for 1982-83 while the Reserve Bank is challenging in the Supreme Court the right of the Pay-roll Tax Commissioner to tax the loans which were offered to the Bank's 3,500 employees at an interest rate of 7% at a time when ordinary housing interest rates were 13%; if so, can these reports be substantiated.

        —The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) The report in the Age of 14 March 1985 refers to a case heard before the Supreme Court of Victoria between the Reserve Bank of Australia and the Commissioner for Pay-roll Tax in Victoria. By way of background, the Reserve Bank pays pay-roll tax according to the provisions of the Pay-roll Tax (State Taxation of Commonwealth Authorities) Act 1971 and relevant State legislation. The Reserve Bank appealed against the Victorian Commissioners's power to include benefits to employees of the Victorian Branch of the Reserve Bank, in the form of low interest housing loans in a new, wider definition of wages on which pay-roll tax in Victoria is now assessed. The Reserve Bank argued that such powers do not appear to be permissible under the relevant provisions of the Reserve Bank Act 1959 and the Pay-roll Tax (State Taxation of Commonwealth Authorities) Act 1971. The court upheld the Reserve Bank's appeal but the Commissioner has lodged an appeal against this decision.
      </para>
      <para>
       The dispute refers only to Victorian-based employees of the Reserve Bank who have housing loans (less than 3,500). The Reserve Bank estimates that the amount of tax involved would be substantially less than $47,644.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) (a) Commercial banks are liable to pay pay-roll tax on wages. In Victoria they are also liable to pay pay-roll tax on the benefits attributable to low interest housing loans to staff in terms of the Pay-roll Tax (Further Amendment) Act 1982 which came into force on 1 January 1983.
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) The Commonwealth Banking Corporation, like the Reserve Bank, pays Pay-roll tax on wages according to the provisions of relevant legislation. Since January 1983, additional pay-roll tax on the assessed benefit attributable to staff in respect of concessional housing loan interest rates has been paid in Victoria by the Corporation in terms of the Pay-roll Tax (Further Amendment) Act 1982. The Corporation made these additional payments under protest to the Commissioner of Pay-roll Tax pending the outcome of the Reserve Bank litigation before the Supreme Court. This action was resolved in favour of the Reserve Bank but the Commissioner has lodged an appeal against the decision. The Commonwealth Banking Corporation will reassess its position in the light of the outcome of that litigation.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) The current situation is that there is a long- standing provision in the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936, paragraph 26 (e), which includes in assessable income the value to a taxpayer of all benefits, allowances, etc. received in respect of, or for, or in relation directly or indirectly to, any employment or services rendered by the taxpayer. The extent to which low interest housing loans provided by the employer banks would result in a benefit to their employees would depend upon the facts of each case. It is the responsibility of each employee to include in income tax returns the value of any benefit so received.
      </para>
      <para>
       The banks have not been required by the Australian Taxation Office to supply details of low-interest housing loans provided to their employees. The Reserve Bank and the Commonwealth Banking Corporation have advised that they regard any personal taxation liability arising from these loans to be a private matter between individual members of staff and the Australian Taxation Office.
      </para>
      <para>
       As announced in the September statement on tax reform, a separate tax is to be imposed on employers in respect of the total taxable value of non-cash fringe benefits (including low interest loans) provided to employees. All employers (with the exception of religious institutions) will be liable for the tax, including those not subject to income tax such as Commonwealth and State governments and their agencies, local government bodies and charitable institutions. The taxable value of a low interest loan will generally be equal to the difference between interest accruing at a prescribed interest rate and interest accruing at the actual interest rate charged. A single prescribed rate will apply to all types of loans and will be set annually prior to the commencement of the tax year to which it applies. The tax will commence on 1 July 1986 and a quarterly basis of payment will be adopted with the first payment due and payable in October 1986.

       On 30 April, 1980, the Civil Air Operations Officers Association of Australia (CAOOAA) forwarded to the Department a working paper titled `Flow Control and Holding Stacks; (A Different View)'. The paper was the subject of an initial investigation by Air Traffic Control technical staff followed by the Air Traffic Services Planning Committee, after which a special working group which included representatives of CAOOAA on a consultative basis was formed to consider the paper's implications on the flow system at Sydney. On the basis of these investigations which were completed in April 1981, it was determined that `though several of the CAOOAA suggestions had merit the paper did not provide an adequate answer to flow control problems'. No recommendation was therefore made to adopt the CAOOAA suggestions.

       I am advised by my Department that prior to the Skytraders approval, Qantas held discussions with TAA regarding freight operations from Perth to Brunei using a Boeing 727 cargo aircraft which TAA had available. The lack of cargo capacity of the aircraft and limited range, necessitating a fuel stop at Port Hedland, made such a service uneconomical and Qantas did not proceed with the proposal.

The code provides a set of practical guidelines for the South African operations of Australian companies, which are broadly consistent with their legal obligations and accepted standards of social responsibility in Australia.

       Consistent with the recommendations of that Report, the Communications Legislation Amendment Act 1985 incorporates into the Telecommunications Act 1975 those offences currently in the By-Laws and Regulations dealing with the misuse of Telecom's network, including the supply, connection and maintenance of lines, apparatus, equipment or fittings, and the alteration or modification of approved private branch exchanges and private lines. The penalties relating to these offences have been substantially increased to $5000 or imprisonment for 2 years, or both.

       In a further response to the Vincent Report the Act provides that Telecom is under a duty, in performing its functions, to use its best endeavours to ensure that its network is not used in, or in the furtherance of, an offence under Commonwealth, State or Territory law.

       Has his attention been drawn to an article in the Age of 15 August 1985, written by former Australian Broadcasting Corporation staff member Huw Evans stating that a new regional broadcasting structure would provide an opportunity to dismantle the great bureaucratic ABC monolith in favour of a small group of lean, autonomous accountable units with a precisely described function; if so, what steps will the Government take to implement the proposal.

      <para>
       My attention has been drawn to the article in the Age of 15 August 1985 written by former ABC staff member Mr Huw Evans.
      </para>
      <para>
       One of the problems with Mr Evans' reported views on possible substitute structures for the ABC is that he makes no clear distinction between what might be appropriate in radio as against television.
      </para>
      <para>
       The two media do, of course, demand quite different structural arrangements. Television, because of its economic and resource needs, tends towards a centralised service; radio, because it is resource-flexible and can specialise its formats, is considered essentially a decentralised locally-focused medium. Indeed much of the logic of the current re-organisation of ABC Radio is in accordance with Mr Evans' proposals. ABC Radio is moving towards the notion of a federation of production units (Branches) which produce a considerable amount of local programming but also combine under federal co-ordination to produce nationwide programming.
      </para>
      <para>
       Only ABC-FM remains a centralised service. However, it too, from its base in Adelaide, is drawing more and more on production capacity from around the nation.
      </para>
      <para>
       In the case of television, it is generally accepted that there is a clear need for a national public service television broadcaster and television channel that provides a comprehensive, independent news and current affairs service as its cornerstone.

       One concern about a public service broadcasting structure that was entirely fragmented into regional units would be the difficulty of retaining national focus. Such a focus has been traditionally seen as at least one crucial aspect of public service broadcasting. A certain degree of centralisation also has the advantages of cost-benefits in terms of cost-per-viewer of programs, shared use of resources and staff and enabling a wide variety of skills and services to be maintained.

       A major concern about Mr Evans' UK Channel 4-style solution is simply the small number of independent production houses that can be expected to exist, given this country's small population base. While the UK's Channel 4 may be able to foster and draw on independent producers in Britain, the scope for that to occur in Australia in competition with existing commercial broadcasters is much reduced. This would also apply to a publicly funded broadcasting system based on small autonomous regional structures.

       The Role and functions of the ABC were examined relatively recently by the Dix Committee of Review and a new organisation was established under the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983. The present Board of the ABC is also working to revise the Corporate objectives and structure of the Corporation. There is no intention to change direction in these circumstances on the basis of a personal view expressed by Mr Evans.

       (6) (a) and (b) It is not possible to attribute all new enrolments to the campaign as other factors influence enrolment activity and, at the time of this campaign the AEO was also processing enrolments generated by a recent habitation review. However, between the weeks ending 26 October 1983 and 6 January 1984, 76,272 people aged between 18 and 24 were newly enrolled. These people represented 49.73% of all new enrolments for the period.

      <para>
       (7) (a) and (b) Monthly enrolment statistics were monitored by research and information staff and the former AEO during the course of the campaign.

      </para>
      <para>
       (9) The decision to make 17 to 24 year olds the primary target audience was taken after the results of attitudinal research in 1983 which showed that people in this age group were likely to fail to enrol to vote because they did not see any direct link between `the Government or Government institutions' and their own lives. The researchers, Inview Pty Ltd, reported that many young people were apathetic and would not take the steps necessary to become enrolled. Further, the researchers reported, `Few young people have any knowledge of enrolment procedures or of how the electoral system works . . . They do not doubt, however, that the procedure will be difficult.' And ` . . . it is clear that many of the problems facing the young today in securing enrolment will continue to face those becoming newly eligible in the years to come. A case may be made therefore for the consideration of a long term media program of education and reassurance.'

      </talk.start>
      <para>
       In 1982, $120m was accepted for fraud and overservicing by the Australian Medical Association and the previous government as being the best estimate on the data then available. This figure was subsequently revised in 1983 to $130m, however, in evidence given before the Joint Parliamentary Committee of Public Accounts, one professional medical association estimated the figure to be nearer $200m per annum.
      </para>
      <para>
       An accurate measure of the amount involved based on statistical data alone is impossible, although it is evident that both the medical profession and the Government are in agreement that the scale of abuse is cause for considerable concern.
      </para>
      <para>
       Under the arrangements which existed prior to the introduction of Medicare, medical claims were processed by numerous funds and agencies with varying degrees of accuracy. This caused significant delays in collating the data for post-payment analysis, which was the only avenue available to determine the nature and extent of abuses. Under Medicare it is possible for the Health Insurance Commission, as the sole claim payment authority, to quickly and accurately identify abuses during the claims payment processes. In many instances these preventive measures ensure that benefits are not paid, and post-payment analysis of medical benefits data, whilst still an important ingredient of the controls, does not necessarily reflect the full nature and extent of fraud and associated abuses. I am sure the honourable member would agree that measures which effectively preclude the payment of benefits, where abuses are detected, are infinitely preferable to accurately determining the amount paid as a result of such activity,

      <para>
       (1) Yes, I am aware of the article in the Hobart Mercury of 10 August 1985. The Tasmanian Consultative Committee on Social Welfare to which the article refers was appointed by the Minister for Community Services and the Minister for Social Security, and I am informed that the Minister for Community Services has instructed his Department to prepare an assessment of the Committee's recommendations.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) and (3) No statistical data are regularly collected by the CES in respect of these points. My Department informs me that to obtain this information would require the inspection of many thousands of records in all offices of the CES and would result in unwarranted costs.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) The CES provides assistance to the long-term unemployed by way of ongoing contact, advice and counselling, and through the extensive use of labour market programs, which constitute an integral part of the Government's economic strategy. As the honourable member will be aware, the Government's new integrated wage subsidy program-JOBSTART-came into operation on 2 December 1985. This program, which will be administered by the CES, will be targetted to various special needs groups, including the long term unemployed-namely, those who have been unemployed for 6 months or more. Essentially, the new program is designed to encourage employers, through subsidy payments, to engage disadvantaged job seekers who would otherwise be unable to compete successfully in the labour market. The Community Employment Program (CEP) also plays a significant role in assisting those disadvantaged by long-term unemployment to re-enter the work force.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) While every effort is made by the CES to place job seekers in employment as soon as possible after registration, it is not possible to guarantee that all job seekers are automatically referred to jobs or to work preparation/training courses within a six month period.
      </para>
      <para>
       The essential factors governing the CES's ability to make such referrals are:

       * the availability of jobs and of places on work preparation/training courses; and
      </para>
      <para>

      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Deprivation of assets occurs where a person transfers ownership of an asset without adequate financial consideration. Where a close relative works on a farm for little or no wages in anticipation that its title will be transferred to him or her, an estimate of the wages forgone is deducted from the amount which would otherwise be taken into account under the deprivation provisions. Where a balance remains, it is treated as an asset of the original owner; this amount is reduced by one-tenth in each of the succeeding 10 years.

       I am advised by the Australian National Railways Commission (AN) as follows:
      </para>
      <para>
       (1) AN is currently conducting feasibility studies into the construction of a wagon repair depot in Tasmania. A decision will be taken following completion of the feasibility studies.
      </para>

       (2) (b) (i) Adequate repair facilities are considered to exist for these wagons.

      <para>
       (2) (b) (ii) Union work bans have had an effect upon the availability of woodchip wagons. The bans placed by unions in respect to the working of overtime on repair of wagons were lifted on 1 August 1985.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) (b)(iii) Repair of wagons has not been delayed by availability of replacement parts.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) AN intends to phase out LCL (less than car load) traffic in the near future as such traffic contributes substantially to losses incurred by Tasrail.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) Phasing out of LCL traffic would assist Tasrail in improving its efficiency and commercial viability in line with the revitalisation package I announced in August 1985. A decision on the wagon repair depot is expected before the end of 1985-86 and will be taken in light of the results of the feasibility studies currently being undertaken.

      <para>
       (1) Has his attention been drawn to a letter dated 3 September 1985, sent on behalf of the Victorian State Manager of Australia Post to Mr Leonard Banks of Lot 5, Collies Road, Gembrook, Vic., in which he was advised that Australia Post has no control over the movements of registered articles following their despatch from Australia.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) If so, will he take action to have Australia Post tighten its security arrangements so that the registration numbers of items of registered mail forwarded to the United States of America can be individually listed, rather than forwarded in bulk as at present; if not, why not.

      <para>
       (1) Yes. Mr Banks wrote to me on 6 September 1985 attaching a copy of the letter from Australia Post.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Under the provisions of the Universal Postal Convention, Australia Post and the United States Postal Service (USPS) have agreed to use the bulk listing method of documentation for the exchange of registered articles. Australia Post does not propose, at this stage, to seek changes to the agreement with the USPS. The bulk listing system is considered to have worked well for many years with a minimal loss of registered items.
      </para>
      <para>
       The practice of bulk listing registered items is not only confined to Australia and the USA. It is a relatively common practice for the exchange of registered items between a number of countries because of its cost effectiveness.

      <para>
       (a) The main advantage of nuclear powered submarines over conventionally powered submarines is their virtually unlimited submerged endurance. As a result, the nuclear powered submarine has the following operational advantages over the diesel powered submarine:
      </para>
      <para>
       (1) No need to snort thus eliminating those periods required by diesel submarines when the snort mast is above the sea surface and vulnerable to detection. It should be noted that recent developments of air independent propulsion systems (Swedish and West German) will improve the submerged endurance of diesel submarines considerably.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Higher sustained speeds for operational, particularly in interception of targets, support of friendly forces, and in manoeuvres to avoid attack on the submarine.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) An ability to operate under polar ice caps for sustained periods.
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) The disadvantages of the nuclear powered submarine are:
      </para>
      <para>
       (1) They are currently noisier than diesel submarines operating on batteries and are therefore more vulnerable to detection.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) In shallow waters nuclear submarines are unable to exploit their performance advantages over diesel submarines, thus diesel submarines are preferred for inshore operations.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) High initial acquisition and through-life support costs in terms of financial, manpower and safety requirements.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) Their introduction would involve the establishment of an infrastructure, for power plant manufacture and/or support and to support the production, transport, storage, security and eventual disposal of nuclear fuel.

       (1) Yes
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) The 0.08% provision in force in the ACT is based on a recommendation made by the Commonwealth Law Reform Commission. That limit currently applies also in South Australia, Western Australia and the Northern Territory. Internationally, it is understood that some Scandinavian countries and the Netherlands have adopted 0.05%, Canada, the United Kingdom, West Germany and France use 0.08%. In both New South Wales and Victoria the limit is 0.05%.
      </para>
      <para>
       It is apparent therefore that there remains a significant difference of opinion on the appropriate level that should apply. The Department of Territories is monitoring the effect of random breath testing in the ACT, and the results will be considered when a review of the appropriate blood alcohol level is undertaken.

As I have stated on 2 October 1985, in delivering the Sir James Duhig Memorial Lecture at the University of Queensland, ``the time has arrived for Australia to consider a similar (cash reporting transactions) law''. In fact, I am presently considering the utility, for law enforcement purposes, of requiring Australian financial institutions to report large cash transactions by their clients in their interactions with the financial institutions. My initial impression is that such measures are necessary and appropriate in order to take effective action against drug traffickers, tax cheats and organised crime in general.

       (3) Changes to family allowances are matters of Government policy. It should be noted that the allowance continues to be paid for these students in families judged to be in special need. This includes people receiving pensions or other benefits, family income supplement, handicapped child's allowance or a double orphan's pension where the student is not receiving a tertiary or secondary allowance. It also continues for students receiving assistance under the Aboriginal Secondary Assistance Scheme and the Assistance for Isolated Children Scheme.

       (1), (2) and (3) The table below lists all Conventions adopted by the International Labour Conference up to and including the 71st June 1985 Session.
      </para>
      <para>
       The table shows the status of ILO Conventions at 1 January 1985, those Conventions that Australia has ratified, and the current situation in Australia concerning all other Conventions.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) As Australia is a Federal State, the consultative arrangements concerning the possible ratification of ILO Conventions are quite complex. All Conventions have been considered during the last 10 years at various times at Technical Officers Meetings, National Labour Consultative Council Meetings, at the Departments of Labour Advisory Committee or at the Ministers of Labour Meetings.

       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) My Department is unable to supply or to refund the costs of glucometers either under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme or the Medicare arrangements. The Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme is limited to the provision of drugs and medicinal preparations. Under Medicare, medical benefits are only payable towards the costs of professional services rendered by legally qualified medical practitioners, certain specialist medical services rendered by approved dentists and consultations by participating optometrists.
      </para>
      <para>
       I appreciate that obtaining paramedical services and aids and appliances can, at times, prove financially difficult for the public. This was one of the factors which led to the Government establishing the Medicare Benefits Review Committee. This Committee is considering, amongst other things, whether the scope of the Medicare arrangements should be extended. The Committee is expected to present its report on this question by April next year.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) I am unable to anticipate the Committee's recommendations on how the Medicare arrangements might be extended or to foreshadow the Government's response to such recommendations.

      <para>
       (1) The petition was referred to the independent Arbitrator appointed by the Federal and South Aus- tralian Governments to determine the future of the Victor Harbor railway line. It was taken into account by the Arbitrator in making his determination.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) The Australian National Railways Commission (AN) has advised that in its judgment, except for some localised speed restrictions, the current condition of the track between Strathalbyn and Victor Harbor would allow trains to operate at the same line speeds applying at the time of transfer of the railway to the Commonwealth in March 1978. In accordance with the determination of the Arbitrator, maintenance undertaken by AN on the line, other than to secure public safety, ceased in mid-November 1984.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) No. In AN's judgment the line is presently serviceable, although a protracted history of deferred maintenance exists dating back to the introduction of reduced maintenance policies by the South Australian Railways since 1965-66. The rate of maintenance undertaken by AN has been the same as was considered appropriate by the SA Government up until 1978. AN ceased general maintenance of the line in mid-November 1984 pending further investigation by the SA Government into using the line as a tourist railway.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) Discussions were held with the Premier and South Australian Minister of Transport on 30 August 1985. The Minister of Transport wrote to me on 31 October requesting transfer of the line to the State as soon as practicable in view of the South Australian Government's decision for tourist services to operate on the line.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) The Federal Government will expedite the transfer of the line to the South Australian Government. The South Australian Government has announced it will spend $750,000 on rehabilitation of the track. The Federal Government has approved expenditure of $1.258 million under the Community Employment Program to upgrade the track.

      <para>
       (1) and (2) The superannuation scheme proposed by the Transport Workers Union (TWU) for the road transport industry remains the subject of negotiations between the TWU and employers in the industry.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) The question of prudential arrangements for superannuation funds is one that will be covered in the guidelines for occupational superannuation which were foreshadowed by the Treasurer and myself at the time of the Government/ACTU agreement. These guidelines fall within the Treasurer's area of responsibility.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) (a) I understand that the TWU is seeking to have employees included in their proposed scheme as an alternative to company schemes. The Government is opposed to industrial action over superannuation claims.
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) The Government/ACTU agreement provides for the extension and improvement of occupational superannuation based on a 3% wage equivalent to be offset against national productivity. As such it would apply to all employees and the agreement provides for it to be implemented on an industry by industry, occupation by occupation, or, in limited circumstances, company by company basis.
      </para>
      <para>
       (c) I have held discussions with the parties on 15 November at which agreement was reached on how appropriate superannuation arrangements for the industry might be progressed. I have indicated subsequently to the parties that there should be no industrial action if difficulties arise in that process and that parties should seek the assistance of the ACTU and/or the Government in resolving such difficulties.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) The level of contributions for particular categories of employees is a matter that the Government considers should be negotiated between employers and unions within the context of the Government/ACTU agreement, the Treasurer's proposed guidelines for occupational superannuation, and any guidelines that might be established by the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission in the context of the Productivity Case.

      <para>
       (1) The accounts of the New Zealand Meat Producers' Board for the 12 months to 30 September 1984, which are published in the Board's 1984 Annual Report, state that:
      </para>
      <para>
       ``New Zealand Government's approval has been received for the placement of the accumulated deficits in the sheepmeat and beef accounts (total $495.6 million) into subordinated loan accounts at the Reserve Bank of New Zealand with the following interest and repayment terms: no interest to be charged for 5 years to 30 September 1989 and no principal payment for the same period. For the following 25 years (i.e. from 30 September 1989) equal instalments of principal together with interest on the balance at 1% per annum.''
      </para>
      <para>
       Recent press reports suggest that further debts totalling $NZ205 million were accrued for the 12 months to 30 September 1985. In respect of this accounting period the Board's 1984 Annual Report states that:
      </para>
      <para>
       ``The Government authorised the establishment from 1 October 1984 of two new Meat Income Stabilisation sub-accounts to provide for the future operations of the Board in respect of sheepmeat and beef. For the 1984 season these accounts will receive or pay interest at 10 per cent p.a. when in credit or debit but with provision for annual reviews of this rate.''
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) The Supplementary Minimum Price Scheme which was introduced in 1979 ended on 30 September 1984. However, the New Zealand Government agreed to pay an amount for the 1984 season as a one-off payment equivalent to the level of SMPs had the scheme continued; the amount involved totalled $NZ130 million compared with $NZ262 million in the previous year.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) The concessional financial terms of the loans arranged by the New Zealand Government will assist the New Zealand Meat Producers' Board in repaying its debts. The question of the impact of such arrangements on any lamb exports to Australia is a matter for consideration in the context of any formal complaints under the countervailing provisions of the Closer Economic Relations Trade Agreement. Respective industries represented by the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation and the New Zealand Meat Producers' Board have considered trans-Tasman marketing prospects and in this regard the New Zealand Meat Producers' Board has assured the AMLC that it would not export lamb to Australia in 1985.

      <para>
       (1) Yes.
      </para>

       (2) No, the Transport Industry Interstate Drivers Award does not provide for employees in the long distance road freight industry to claim or be paid at time and half for every hour worked. Payment is calculated as follows:
      </para>
      <para>
       For a particular job, for example a Melbourne-Sydney-Melbourne run, the distance is approximately 1800 kms. The award stipulates 57 kmph as the basis for calculations. Therefore to cover 1800 kms is calculated to take 31.6 hours.
      </para>
      <para>
       The 31.6 hours is broken up into 3x10 hours with a 1.6 hours residual. Given a standard working day of 8 hours the employee is paid 3x8 24 hours at ordinary time plus the 1.6 hour residual at ordinary time. The remaining 6 hours (31.6-25.6) is paid as overtime at double the ordinary hourly rate.

        —The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) The debts of the New Zealand Meat Producers' Board, which are a consequence of price stabilisation conducted by the Board on behalf of the New Zealand industry, have built up over a number of years and presently are reported to total around $NZ700 million. The NZ sheepmeat industry's problems have been known to me for some time. I met with the President of the Sheepmeat Council of Australia in January this year in response to industry's concerns about Government support for the NZ industry and the adequacy of the anti-dumping/countervailing provisions of the Australian-New Zealand Closer Economic Relations Trade Agreement.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) The concerns of Australian agricultural industry, including the sheepmeat industry, about possible imports of dumped/subsidised New Zealand products have been discussed on several occasions with New Zealand Ministers and officials. The latest occasion was at the Joint Ministerial Meeting which was held in Canberra in August 1985.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) In these discussions, the safeguard provisions of the Trade Agreement have been acknowledged, and in particular the application of international rules in respect of dumped/subsidised imports which cause or threaten material injury to industry is recognised. Both Governments aim to reduce industry assistance and facilitate industry adjustment; the recent elimination of Supplementary Minimum Prices in the case of New Zealand is an example. At the same time we have agreed to consider the removal of export incentives and other such mechanisms in trans-Tasman trade. Closer consultation between industries of both countries is also seen as a valuable way of improving industries' understanding of each other's situation. In this regard, I have noted that the New Zealand Meat Producers' Board and the AMLC are of the view that under present and foreseeable circumstances, trade in lamb will not occur between Australia and New Zealand, and that the Board and the AMLC have agreed to consult in the event of a change in these circumstances.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) The reports that the New Zealand Government may `write-off' the New Zealand Meat Producers' Board debt are speculative at this stage. If necessary, consultations will be held to ensure that any action affecting trans-Tasman trade conforms with the Closer Economic Relations Trade Agreement.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) The `writing-off' of accrued debt could be a subsidy but this would of course relate to past losses and not be a competitive ongoing subsidy of the sort applied by the EC. Under the Closer Economic Relations Trade Agreement no new performance-based export incentives are to be introduced in respect of trans-Tasman trade; other forms of subsidy have not been proscribed.
      </para>
      <para>
       However, the countervailing provisions of the Agreement would apply in the event that imports of subsidised product cause or threaten material injury to Australian industry.
      </para>
      <para>
       (6) In response to anxiety in the industry at potential imports of subsidised sheepmeat my predecessor indicated that he would act according to the provisions of the Trade Agreement. However, no imports took place and hence it was not necessary for the Government to take action.

        —The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       In many cases involving practitioners the charges before the Courts were representative charges. This is common practice in such matters, as they often involve a multitude of offences each one being for a small amount of money. The charges, therefore, may not indicate the full extent of the fraudulent activity or the amount involved.
      </para>
      <para>
       Under the Health Insurance Act the making or issuing of a false or misleading document capable of being used in connection with a claim for Commonwealth medical benefits is a complete offence, and this is reflected in some cases, where the charges preferred do not indicate an amount of money. Accordingly in many cases the records available to the Commission do not indicate the amount of money obtained as a result of the fraudulent activity.
      </para>
      <para>
       The following Schedule provides details of medical practitioners who have been convicted (or against whom charges have been proven) for defrauding or attempting to defraud the Commonwealth in respect of the payment of medical benefits since 1975.
      </para>
      <para>
       All cases were prosecuted in the Commonwealth jurisdiction.

      <para>
       Persons other than doctors who have been convicted of defrauding or attempting to defraud the Commonwealth Medical Benefits arrangements since 1 July 1975 include:
      </para>
      <para>
       (i) persons who have embarked on a systematic course of conduct in an organised manner to defraud the arrangements by use of forged or stolen documentation, these persons can be generally termed `professional criminals';
      </para>
      <para>
       (ii) staff of medical practitioners; and
      </para>
      <para>
       (iii) patients who falsified accounts and receipts to enhance the benefits payable by altering or adding services.
      </para>
      <para>
       Many persons in the above categories were charged with either `Attempted Fraud' or `Endeavouring to Impose' when the offences were detected prior to any payments being made. Therefore many cases show no amount of money as being involved.
      </para>
      <para>
       Each of these cases was prosecuted in the Commonwealth jurisdiction.
      </para>
      <para>
       The following Schedule provides details of persons other than medical practitioners who have been convicted (or against whom charges have been proven) for defrauding or attempting to defraud the Commonwealth's Medical Benefits arrangements since 1 July 1975.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Schedule does not contain details of persons convicted of offences against registered health insurance organisations between 30 September 1978 and 1 February 1984 where prosecutions were initiated by direct referral of the matters by registered organisations to the appropriate authorities, apart from those referred by the Health Insurance Commission, which traded during that period solely as Medibank Private.

        —The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) Expenditure by the Department and authorities under my control on public relations was $124,037 in 1983-84 and in 1984-85 was $121,668.20. This expenditure includes public relations work conducted by the Public Relations Unit of the Department and by the Albury-Wodonga Development Corporation.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Expenditure by the Public Relations Unit of the Department was on the printing and publication of reports such as the Annual Report and Departmental Directory, as well as on publications requested by the Minister's Office such as the Budget Statement and Ministerial Newsletters. Expenditure by the Albury- Wodonga Development Corporation was directed at marketing and promotion of the growth centre with the marketing effort aimed at the attraction of investment.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) (a) In relation to the Albury-Wodonga Development Corporation public relations assistance was sought from Professional Public Relations Pty Ltd. The Public Relations Unit of the Department sought assistance from Monitair Pty Limited.
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) Payments to Professional Public Relations Pty Ltd were as follows: 1983-84, $112,987; 1984-85, $101,946.
      </para>
      <para>
       Payments to Monitor Media Monitoring Pty Limited totalled $1,428.60 in 1984-85.
      </para>
      <para>
       (c) The Albury-Wodonga Development Corporation does not have a presence in the capital cities and must therefore from time to time seek assistance in its marketing efforts in those areas. The Department sought assistance from Monitair to provide a Departmental press clipping service. This assistance was necessary because of insufficient resources in the Public Relations Unit to provide this essential information service to Departmental management.

       (4) The export of arms and defence equipment from Australia is controlled under Schedule 13 of the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations of the Customs Act 1901. Current guidelines for the export of defence materiel take account of foreign and domestic political implications, strategic factors and the need for viable defence industries in Australia. Proposals to export Australian defence equipment are considered on a case by case basis. As a general rule, exports to countries engaged in military conflict are not approved. Australia has also been very wary of exporting defence materiel in situations likely to result in military conflict. Exports are not approved where there is strong evidence that they would be used by the recipient primarily for the suppression of domestic opposition. Exports of defence material are prohibited to countries against which the United Nations Security Council had decided to take endorsement measures or where exports are proscribed under international instruments to which Australia is a party.

        —The answer to the right honourable member's question is as follows:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1a) With respect to aspects relating to overall ship design, a Technical Memo has been prepared and issued to ship designers in the Department as an `Aide Memoire` in future ship design or ship evaluation tasks. Many operational and organisational aspects of the lessons learned from the Falklands conflict also have had an impact on ship design and for this reason a close liaison between the Technical Authorities of the Department and the Ship Operators has been maintained.
      </para>
      <para>
       (1b) The selection of construction materials for HMA ships has always been based on a Fitness for Service Criterion which in most cases has conflicting requirements of structural strength, survivability, weight, habitability and other special application needs. The Falklands lessons have highlighted the need to place more emphasis on ship and crew survivability than had previously been applied. Towards this end more extensive materials testing is planned, prior to application in HMA ships. The acquisition of material toxicity testing equipment is being currently pursued and materials specifications for such applications as mattresses, electric cables, buoyancy vests, deck coverings, and ladders have been revised.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) There is no evidence that the use of aluminium in warships construction contributed to the loss of any ship in the Falklands conflict. However, although previously recognised, the poor performance of aluminium in fires and blast was reaffirmed. Aluminium offers advantages in weight savings and corrosion resistance compared to steel when used for the construction of superstructures on warships. The reduced weight or topweight savings enhances the stability of warships and permits the siting of additional sensors and weapons high on the ship thus making the ship less vulnerable. The application of aluminium in superstructures of future warships will be assessed on a case by case basis to exploit its advantages and to minimize its disadvantages.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3a) Extensive use of aluminium was made in the construction of the superstructures of the following HMA ships: Perth, Brisbane, Hobart, Adelaide, Sydney, Canberra, Darwin, Swan, Torrens, Cook, Tobruk and The Fremantle and attack class patrol boats.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3b) The Australian Frigates under construction at Williamstown Naval Dockyard will have aluminium superstructures, in conformity with the basic USN design of the FFGs.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3c) It is intended that warships planned for the immediate future will not have aluminium superstructures. Nor will aluminium be used for ladders, gratings, or minor bulkheads.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) The lessons learned from the Falklands conflict are now well documented. Changes in construction and design work which may be proposed to overcome weaknesses on existing ships exposed during the Falklands conflict will be influenced by practicability, the remaining life of the ships and the availability of funds against other competing requirements. However more than any- thing else the naval ship designer has been reminded that the warship is a weapon of war and must be designed and constructed accordingly. This has impacted on standards, criteria and specifications for future warships. They affect the ship design at its conceptual stage of development, ship system design and material selection.

      <para>
       (1) Current Defence doctrine requires the deployment of the RAAF tactical fighter force in both ground support and naval support roles as well as purely air operations.
      </para>
      <para>
       For the ground support the fighter force could be used to deliver air-to-ground weapons, although doctrine states that surface-to-surface fire support will be used in preference, if the choice is available. This is because the use of surface weapons will usually be more economical and have a shorter reaction time, while the need to carefully integrate air support with the ground manoeuvre plan and the competing demands for air defence and interdiction may restrict the use of the aircraft in the ground support role.
      </para>
      <para>
       In the naval support or maritime role, the fighter force could be used in strategic and tactical strike operations, for mining and for air defence.
      </para>

       (2) Priorities for combat deployment of aircraft in a ground attack role would be determined by the force commander in the light of prevailing strategic and tactical circumstances.

       (1) The grant of $12,850 to the Australian Medical Students' Association (AMSA) under the 1985-86 National Community Health Program was made to assist with the travel costs for the AMSA executive and the costs of two national council meetings. This is an on-going grant. Assistance of this nature has been provided to AMSA since the mid-1970s.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Through its annual conventions and periodic workshops, AMSA is actively involved in broadening the scope of medical under-graduate education into the areas of community health and inter-disciplinary health care. AMSA provides a forum for addressing issues of importance to modern medical practice which are either not included in under-graduate medical curricula or are dealt with inadequately. AMSA's activities are therefore consistent with the Government's objective of promoting more effective and cost-efficient health services.

       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) (a) Yes, the Jackson Report did contain a series of recommendations on voluntary agencies, i.e. non-government organisations (NGOs), and their role in development.
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) Most NGOs in Australia receive strong public support. Their projects and programs are mostly at the local level and are low cost.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) The Government recognises that small scale community projects are a most effective way to help the local people. In the 1985/86 budget the Government has substantially increased the level of funds for the programs of NGOs to a total of $19.859 million. Details are given in Budget Paper No. 9.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) (a) and (b) Information is not available on forward commitments of NGOs; it is not possible to confirm whether a re-allocation of the size suggested would accommodate all such forward commitments.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) (a) The programmed allocation of aid through NGOs is 1.9% of the 1985/86 aid budget; this excludes unforeseen emergency aid and is likely to be exceeded (in 1984-85 the figure was 2.5%).
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) There is no official OECD average of aid through NGOs but the figure of 5-6% is around the median for those OECD countries which report on their use of non-governmental channels. I announced on 28 November 1985 that further increases in subsidies for projects of NGOs were justified, though further long-term growth in these subsidies would need to be commensurate with the capacity of NGOs to mobilise public support and to deliver the increased allocation.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) The Government is continuing to respond to the famine in Africa by providing substantial relief assistance through various channels including NGOs. In the 1985/86 allocation for NGO programs of $19.859 million, $5.272 million has been earmarked as food and other emergency aid through NGOs for the victims of drought in Africa.

      <para>
       (2) Primary responsibility for the management of vertebrate pests rests with State and Territory Governments. Nevertheless, the Commonwealth has a long-standing interest in cane toads and the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service has funded research on this animal in the past. The Commonwealth is also concerned because cane toads have now spread into the Northern Territory and may eventually pose a threat to native wildlife, including populations in Kakadu National Park.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) The appropriate forum for addressing wildlife conservation matters which impinge upon several states or territories is the Council of Nature Conservation Ministers (CONCOM). The wildlife authorities of Western Australia, Northern Territory, Queensland, New South Wales and the Commonwealth have participated in the development of a co-operative program to address problems associated with the spread of cane toads.

       A working group, comprising representatives of these authorities and appropriate technical experts, has prepared a detailed proposal for the investigation of possible biological control agents which may be present in Australia.

      <para>
       (1) The Illawarra Management Advisory Committee (IMAC), a Committee consisting of local, State and non-voting Commonwealth representatives which is responsible for recommending Illawarra tourism projects to the New South Wales Government for Commonwealth funding under the Steel Regions Assistance Program, has recommended that $250,000 be sought this financial year for the construction of a building to house the Air Museum's aircraft collection and auxiliary exhibits. The Committee gave priority by a narrow vote, which did not involve Commonwealth representatives, to this project over three other projects which the Committee considered were ready to come forward to the Commonwealth for detailed consideration. The Commonwealth subsequently received a submission from the N.S.W. Government requesting funding of $250,000 for the Air Museum this financial year.
      </para>
      <para>
       I am of the view that the case for this project might not be as strong as that for some other tourism projects in the Illawarra region yet to be the subject of detailed proposals under the Steel Regions Program. Accordingly, I will take a final decision on the Air Museum proposal when detailed proposals on remaining projects are received. The Commonwealth is seeking to have these proposals submitted as quickly as possible.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) At this stage I cannot give a final decision on funding for this project.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) If no Steel Regions Program funds are forthcoming, proponents of this project will need to look to alternative sources of funds-Local, State or Commonwealth-for the construction of the building in question.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) The Air Museum appears to have some tourism potential. As mentioned, however, the potential of this project will be assessed against other tourism proposals under the Steel Regions Program and the final decision will be based on the relative merits of all proposals.

       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) (a) It is not necessary for retailers of radiocommunications equipment to obtain licences provided they do not operate their equipment. Operators of citizen band (CB) radiocommunication equipment are required to obtain a licence.
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) At the present time there exists an `equipment specification' for CB radios which sets the minimum technical performance that the equipment must meet. Equipment that does not meet this requirement cannot be imported or licenced.
      </para>
      <para>
       Under the Radiocommunications Act 1983 there is provision for ministerial standards for CB radios. Work has begun on the development of ministerial standards based on Department of Communication's specifications. Publicity will be given to each ministerial standard as it comes into force.
      </para>
      <para>
       When ministerial standards are in force it will be an offence to supply or possess sub-standard CB radiocommunications transmitters or receivers. In addition sub-standard equipment cannot be imported or licensed.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Monitoring to detect illegal radiocommunications activity is conducted by the Department of Communications on a regular basis and illegal users are prosecuted to protect licensed spectrum users.
      </para>
      <para>
       Where radiocommunications equipment meets the ministerial standard, Compliance Statement Certificates will be issued by my Department to manufacturers and importers. This Certificate will authorise the attachment of a compliance statement to each piece of equipment. By this means the equipment can be identified as meeting my Department's requirements.

      <para>
       (1) For the latest estimates of the effects of the taxation reform measures, as calculated by the Department of Housing and Construction, see my answer on 10 October 1985, Hansard, page 1801. No calculations have been done on the effects of capital gains taxation alone, since it is the effect of the package of measures that is important.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) (a) and (b) The Indicative Planning Council for the Housing Industry in its October Short-Term Prospects Report 1985, which I released on 15 November, concludes that the package or taxation reform measures will have only a small effect on housing activity.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Council does expect a shift in the composition of investor activity, with rental investment tending to be more directed towards new dwellings (typically `other' dwellings, that is, flats townhouses etc). In addition, alterations, additions and capital improvements to older dwellings are expected to increase.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) Based on the calculations, and as I indicated in the House on 10 October, I believe that the overall taxation package will not have adverse effects on rents.

A copy of the certificate of incorporation is requested from the organisation requiring funding as proof of incorporation.

As this duplicates the requirements of the Ordinance a check with the Australian Capital Territory Corporate Affairs Commission is not conducted.

       (1) The Local Government and Regional Development Division of the Department in 1985-86 provided two grants to organisations operating in the ACT. The first grant was a contribution of $35,000 to the Australian Institute of Urban Studies and the second was a payment of $56,000 to the Canberra College of Advanced Education towards the sponsorship of scholarships for the training of elected representatives and officers from smaller, poorer and more remote Councils throughout Australia. In addition, organisations operating or registered in the ACT are eligible to apply for grants under the Local Government Development Program. The closing date for applications in 1985-86 was 31 October 1985, and therefore the Department is not in a position to provide details of these grants.

       (1) The South Australian and Tasmanian Governments provide financial assistance to their respective State shipping services. Questions on the manner and level of that assistance should be directed to those Governments. However, I note that the 1983/84 Annual Report of the South Australian Highways Department (the latest available) indicates that operating losses of $3.22m on the MV Troubridge are taken up in that Department's budget for that year, and that the 1983/84 Annual Report of the Tasmanian Transport Commission indicates that net losses of $798,000 for the coastal shipping service and $621,000 for the Bruny ferry are taken up in its budget for that year.
      </para>
      <para>
       During 1984 and 1985 the Federal Government contributed a total of $26m as a special grant for the acquisition of the passenger ferry Abel Tasman by the Tasmanian Government.
      </para>
      <para>
       I should also note that the calculation of the relativities for distributing Federal financial assistance grants to the States, undertaken by the Grants Commission, takes account of the full operating deficits of State coastal shipping operations.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Apart from the assistance referred to in (1) the Federal Government provides no subsidies for State or privately owned coastal shipping services.

       The Agreement between the Government and the Australian Council of Trade Unions in relation to the operation of the Accord for the next two years announced by the Treasurer and myself on 4 September 1985 and subsequently endorsed by the ACTU Executive and National Conference, includes an agreement on a joint approach to the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission in the Productivity Case.
      </para>
      <para>
       The question of whether scope exists for distribution of additional benefits on account of productivity is a matter for determination by the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. The issue of the period over which this productivity growth is measured will be addressed during hearings before the Commission.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) The question of when a further productivity claim could be mounted by the ACTU will be determined by the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission following the review of the National Wage Principles currently before the Commission. As announced in my joint statement with the Treasurer, of 4 September, the Government's support for the measures set out in the Agreement will be based on continuance of the no extra claims commitments.

      <para>
       (1) As announced in the joint statement by the Treasurer and myself on 4 September 1985, the Government and the ACTU will propose to the Commission that the 4 per cent productivity claim brought by the ACTU and currently before the Commission should result in an increase of 3 per cent to be paid in the form of new or improved occupational superannuation, with implementation to commence in July 1986. Any superannuation arrangements would be progressively implemented over the following couple of years to about mid-1988, as negotiations between unions and employers are completed.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) and (3) The Government accepts that the productivity claim must be determined by the Commission on its merits. The quantum and timing of any decision on national productivity will thus have regard to the current and prospective state of the economy.
      </para>
      <para>
       To the extent that the Commission finds that economic capacity exists for an increase to be distributed, procedures will need to be developed to ensure that changes to introduce superannuation are consistent with the findings and determination of the Commission.

      <para>
       In the event that the Commission determines a quantum other than 3 per cent, this is a matter which would be discussed by the Government and the ACTU as part of the Accord process.

       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) The impact of the revised child care subsidy arrangements on families is summarised by the following:
      </para>
      <para>
       48,500 families (58 per cent of all users) currently in receipt of fee relief and using centres and FDC schemes will have a maximum increase of $2 a week. Incomes of these families will generally be below $25,000.
      </para>
      <para>
       5,000 families (about 6 per cent of all users) but only those using centre based day care will have increases of up to $10 a week. These families will have incomes of around $26,000.
      </para>
      <para>
       9,000 families (about 10 per cent of all users) but only those using centre based day care will have increases of between $10 and $20. These families will mostly be on incomes greater than $30,000.
      </para>
      <para>
       1,600 families (about 1 per cent of all users) but only those using centre based day care will pay between $20 and $25 a week more. Most will have incomes greater than $36,000.
      </para>
      <para>
       2,500 families (3 per cent of all users) using either higher cost, centre based or family day care will have fee decreases. This is because of the lowering of the second withdrawal rates and applies to families in the income range of about $26,000 to $32,000 a year.
      </para>
      <para>
       17,000 families (22 per cent of all users) but only those families who use family day care and are not eligible for fee relief will continue to pay the same fee.
      </para>
      <para>
       Generally families who now receive fee relief (i.e. families with incomes up to $25,000 a year) will pay no more than $2 per week extra for fulltime care. The exceptions would be those families using services with fees in the $80-$85 range for fulltime care. Centres may use Special Fee Relief to reduce or waive the additional charge. It is clear that child care under the revised subsidy arrangements will remain affordable for low-income families.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) The 20,000 places announced by the Prime Minister as part of his election commitment will be created over the next three years and the allocation of these places will be determined by way of a planning approach based on an assessment of needs. This will be done in consultation with Commonwealth-State Planning Committees for Children's Services which function in each State and Territory. They provide advice on identified areas of high need formulated on the basis of statistical analysis, community consultation and the relevant knowledge and expertise of individual members.

      <para>
       (b) These helicopters did not operate over built-up areas but flew within a Helicopter Lane established by the Department of Aviation over the Parramatta River at the mandatory altitude of 500 feet above ground/sea level. Helicopters are required to remain on the right side of the Lane for separation from opposite direction traffic and, because of the narrowness of the river in the Drummoyne area most fly necessarily close to the river bank. To residents in the Drummoyne area it might appear that the helicopters were actually passing over the buildings, but this was not the case.

       The Repatriation General Hospital, Concord, has not maintained the information on accidents in a form which would provide the information sought by the honourable member. However, day reports which are held for a period of two years only have been examined and data on accident cases treated have been extracted for 1984 and 1985.

       Figures for admissions through Casualty are available but it should be noted that these are not solely accident cases. Admissions to the hospital, other than those that have been pre-booked or admitted direct to the ward or from the Outpatient Department, are arranged through Casualty.
      </para>

       Over the last twelve months, the hospital has been reviewing its requirements for information from the computer-based admission and discharge system. Amendments are to be made which will enable a more detailed breakdown of information to be available in future.

These are section 115 of the Crimes Act 1900 (NSW) in its application to the A.C.T. (which concerns the dishonest use of computers) and section 276 of the Northern Territory Criminal Code 1983 (concerning the making of false data processing material) respectively.
      </para>
      <para>
       (c) There does appear to be a problem in the comprehensiveness and accuracy of statistics on computer abuse in Australia. For example, the Law Reform Commission of Tasmania in its recently published research paper on `Computer Misuse', comments, in relation to this problem within and outside of Australia, that: ``Estimates of the community cost of `computer crime' vary so widely and wildly that it is difficult to regard them at all seriously.''
      </para>
      <para>
       (d) Without comprehensive and accurate statistics in relation to computer crime the question of whether it is a significant and growing element of criminal behaviour cannot be conclusively answered.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) The matter of appropriate legislative provisions in relation to computer crime is being considered by the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General which is meeting in Canberra on 6 December 1985. I will write to the honourable member to advise the position reached at the meeting.

       The number of full-time staff employed under the Public Service Act in each department at 30 June is published in the Public Service Board's Annual Report. For the years requested the page references are as follows:

       (d) The PSB discontinued its monthly collection of Public Service Act employment levels after June 1984. The Department of Finance assumed responsibility for advising the Government on human resource levels in July 1984. Figures from the monthly collection which it introduced for this purpose relate to average operative staffing levels and are not comparable with the Board's series on employment under the Public Service Act. The Department of Finance figures for operative staff at 31 October 1985 are shown below.

       Some locations do not report on weekends or public holidays, but send totals covering those days on the first day thereafter. Zero rain is not reported, hence non-receipt of a report is assumed as zero.
      </para>
      <para>
       Estimates of the average percentage of nil or incomplete reports depend on the prevailing rainfall situation during the period concerned. In a `dry' week it can be safely assumed that a nil report on a particular day refers to zero rainfall; in a week where isolated showers were reported the estimate of missing observations of rainfall is made with less confidence; in a week of heavy rainfall throughout the area concerned missing reports can be clearly identified.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) Taking into account the variation between `dry' and `wet' years there is no evidence of any increase in the numbers of `missing' reports except in Western Australia, and a slight increase in South Australia.
      </para>
      <para>
       Most of the deficiencies in the telegraphic rainfall reporting can be traced to communications problems such as delays in obtaining telegram service over the telephone.
      </para>
      <para>
       In Western Australia, Northern Territory and the north of South Australia a number of observers use the Royal Flying Doctor Service to transmit reports, and are consequently unavailable for contact if follow-up action is necessary. There is also an impression among some Observers in Western Australia that the Bureau only requires reports of rainfall of 3 millimetres or more. Action to rectify this misconception is taken during inspection visits by Bureau staff.
      </para>
      <para>
       Continual action is taken by the Bureau of Meteorology in each of its Regional Offices to ensure that the highest quality of the reporting networks is maintained. This is done by personal telephone contact, correspondence, and inspection visits by Bureau staff as an ongoing and continual task. Most rainfall reports are provided by volunteers who are unpaid, and persuasion is the only avenue available.

      <para>
       (1) (a) Departmental guidelines covering the use of taxis by staff are based on the `Rules for the Use of Official Motor Transport', issued by the Department of Local Government and Administrative Services' Central Transport Authority. In accordance with these rules the use of official transport (including taxis) for staff travelling to or from their places of residence is not normally permitted, except in special circumstances such as:
      </para>
      <para>
       where staff would otherwise be subject to risk of violence;
      </para>
      <para>
       where public transport is not reasonably available to an officer required to work outside the normal hours of duty; or
      </para>
      <para>
       during transport stoppages in the case of certain essential staff.
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) It is the local Manager's responsibility to ensure that this provision is not abused and that a `commonsense' approach is used regarding taxi usage or fare reimbursement. In considering any particular situation the safety and physical well-being of staff is of paramount concern.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Yes.
      </para>
      <para>
       (a) The cost of fares was $111 per trip-$222 per day.

      <para>
       (b) Total fares paid were $1887.

       (c) Disclosure of the officer's name would not assist to serve the public interest and on privacy grounds is not publicly disclosed.

       (d) The staff member was an acting Clerical Assistant Grade 3 in the Systems Support Section.

       (e) Annual salary-$15,391.

      <para>
       (f) The officer was required to perform shift work in the Systems Support Section from 10.36 p.m. until 4.30 a.m. the following morning. Due to the risk of violence in using public transport outside peak hours the use of a taxi was approved by her Section Head. On becoming aware of this situation on 15 November 1985 immediate steps were taken at a higher management level to arrange a more appropriate means of travel for this officer. Initially, arrangements were made for the officer to drive her own vehicle to the Sydney Metropolitan area with transport by taxi being provided for the remainder of the trip. From 9 December 1985 arrangements have been made for the officer to work solely on day shifts and, subsequently, to use normal public transport at her own expense.

       (1) The Australian Wool Corporation provides Australia's contribution to the International Wool Secretariat budget in nine currencies. When there is a net devaluation of the $A against these currencies the cost of Australia's contribution will rise and vice versa.
      </para>
      <para>
       Any increased industry expenditure on wool promotion arising from the recent devaluation of the $A must be measured against the overall net benefits to the industry stemming from its improved competitiveness. Less industry funds are required to purchase and hold wool stocks, and prices to growers are higher than they would otherwise be.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) No. The current program is already generous and has provided a growing level of funds, considerably in excess of that provided by any previous Government. No other rural industry receives such a level of subsidy to supplement its own promotional efforts.

      <para>
       I have received representation from both individual importers and the agent (Australian Livestock Imports) about the condition of the animals released from the sixth shipment (released during March 1985). These complaints centred on the feeding methods used at Cocos Island and loss of weight and condition by a number of the cattle involved in that shipment.
      </para>
      <para>
       In response to these complaints, an expert consultant (nominated by Australian Livestock Imports) and the Senior Principal Veterinary Officer from the Animal Quarantine and Exports Branch of my Department reviewed all aspects of the station's cattle management program. Recommendations resulting from this visit were accepted by both Australian Livestock Imports and the condition of animals in the 7th Shipment was again the subject of complimentary representations.

      <para>
       (1) The majority of staff in the Department of Primary Industry are located in rural areas as technical personnel engaged in the inspection of meat for export. It would normally be to these designations, given the availability of suitably qualified Aboriginal applicants, that recruitment would be most effectively facilitated.
      </para>
      <para>
       Unfortunately the downward trend in the meat industry has resulted in the closure of a large number of meat works and the Department is presently attempting to reduce meat in inspection staffing.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Department reviewed base grade clerical positions in 1984 and 1985 for their suitability for recruitment under the Aboriginal Services clerical recruitment programs. None of the positions reviewed was suitable as they did not possess the facility for rotation of occupants, as was then required by the programs.
      </para>
      <para>
       This requirement has now been removed and the Department expects to be in a position to participate in the Aboriginal Services clerical recruitment programs in 1986.

       While the Australian Government recognises the right of the Indonesian Government to determine access to Indonesian provinces, it has continued to make known its concern to the Indonesian Government that international access be permitted to the province. As stated by the Prime Minister in Parliament on 22 August, Australia's recognition of Indonesian sovereignty over East Timor has enabled Australia to seek permission for visits to the province by Australian delegations, including by non-government organisations. Both Australian parliamentary delegations, and representatives of the Australian and other international media have obtained Indonesian permission to visit East Timor. Most recently, in October this year, a party of officials led by the Australian Ambassador to Indonesia visited East Timor. Further, the Australian Government has also supported access to East Timor for international humanitarian organisations and aid workers in line with our continuing concern about the human rights situation in the province. The Government is pleased to note in this respect that the International Committee of the Red Cross and United Nations Children's Fund are operating in East Timor. Since September 1975, the Australian Government has provided about $9 million in relief assistance to East Timor, mainly through the ICRC and UNICEF.

       It is a central theme of the Government's policy on Indonesia to broaden the range of contacts between the Australian and Indonesian communities. The Government does this in recognition of the value of such contacts in their own right and as a means of building lasting good relations between Australia and Indonesia.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government gives concrete support to this commitment in a variety of ways. Government Departments provide information and advice to a range of interested business and community organisations. The Government provides direct funding for a number of programs, including:
      </para>
      <para>
       Cultural Exchanges: approximately $150,000 was provided for exchanges with Indonesia under the Department of Foreign Affairs Cultural Exchanges program in 1984-85. The activities under this program cover a wide range of areas. An Australian Language Centre was opened in Jakarta in 1983, and is primarily designed to upgrade the English language skills of Indonesian post-graduate fellows coming to study in Australia. A program of Australian Studies has also been established at the University of Indonesia. The Australian Cultural Centre in Jakarta provides an important vehicle for the dissemination of Australian views on political, economic and cultural developments in Australia and around the world, while Radio Australia broadcasts, including English language programs, are a useful way of bringing Indonesian people into close contact with Australian ideas and culture, and are widely listened to.
      </para>
      <para>
       Youth Exchanges: the Government provides $100,000 to fund a current program of exchange of 4 youth leaders and 10 youth delegates from each country. The youth delegate exchange for 1985 is currently taking place.
      </para>
      <para>
       Special Overseas Visitors Fund: each year the Government provides $42,000 for three important Indonesian visitors to Australia as part of this program.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government also provides $112,000 in funding to the Indonesian Project at the Australian National University.
      </para>
      <para>
       As well as these specific activities, an important objective of both our Defence Co-operation Program and development assistance program Indonesia is to foster contact in a variety of fields between the Australian and Indonesian communities. Ministerial visits also provide an important point of contact at a high level. Recently both the Indonesian Minister of Mines and Energy, Dr Subroto, and the Minister of Manpower, Sudomo, visited Australia. The Indonesian Foreign Minister, Dr Mochtar, is also soon to visit Australia. The Minister for Resources and Energy, Senator Evans, and the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations, Mr Willis, have recently visited Indonesia.

      <para>
       Following changes to the Administrative Arrangements Order in December in 1984, responsibility for animal and plant quarantine was transferred from the Department of Health to Department of Primary Industry. The remaining quarantine functions of human and general quarantine have remained the responsibility of the Department of Health pending the outcome of a Public Service Board review. That review has yet to finalise its report and recommendations.
      </para>
      <para>
       The general quarantine function contains considerable animal and plant quarantine activities and these are undertaken by the Department of Health under the policy direction of the Department of Primary Industry.
      </para>
      <para>
       In regard to the operational aspects of animal and plant quarantine, these are undertaken by the State Departments of Agriculture on behalf of the Commonwealth but under the policy direction of the Commonwealth Department of Primary Industry.

       (a) The Federal Government is providing funds to the States and the Northern Territory under the Australian Bicentennial Road Development Trust Fund Act 1982 for four categories of roads. They are National Roads, Urban and Rural Arterial Roads and Local Roads. While Federal road funds under the ABRD Program are provided to State Governments, rather than local government, there is provision for the Local Roads allocation to be distributed to local government authorities in accordance with a set of principles approved by the Federal Minister for Transport. These principles are submitted by the State Government after consultation with relevant local government associations.

       (1)-(3) No. The Australian Labor Party Platform in 1983 had as a priority the establishment of an annual award for scientific achievement promoting the welfare of the peoples of the world. It was proposed that the award be known as the Australia Prize, be worth not less than $100 000 tax free and be administered by the Australian Academy of Science. Higher priorities in the Science portfolio have precluded introduction of the award to date.

        —The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       The principal areas of biological research in CSIRO which have human health implications are human nutrition and food safety. The Division of Human Nutrition carries out most of the human nutrition research. The four programs of the Division are:
      </para>
      <para>
       * Developmental Biology-(pre- and post-natal development of children, with special attention to the central nervous system)
      </para>
      <para>
       * Control Processes in Growth and Over-nutrition-(regulation of energy and protein metabolism and development of obesity and diabetes)
      </para>
      <para>
       * Diet, Lipids and Physiological Functions-(dietary lipids and nutrition-related diseases such as coronary heart disease and obesity)
      </para>
      <para>
       * Nutritional Epidemiology and Behaviour-(relating observed disease patterns to dietary and lifestyle factors)
      </para>
      <para>
       Food safety research is predominantly carried out in one program of the Division of Food Research:
      </para>
      <para>
       * Food Safety and Nutritional Quality-(prevention of food spoilage and poisoning by bacteria, fungi and viruses)
      </para>
      <para>
       Total estimated expenditure on research on human nutrition and food safety in 1985-86, including a component for overhead costs, is $5.955 million.
      </para>
      <para>
       Other biological research in CSIRO, for example core programs concerned with animal health and production, yields results from time to time that have relevance to human health. A number of examples are given below. As this research is primarily directed to other ends, an estimate of expenditure has not been made.
      </para>
      <para>
       * Research on tissue growth in animals led to the discovery of compounds that promote the growth of blood vessels (Division of Molecular Biology). These compounds are being examined for their application in wound healing and in lowering rejection of implantable prosthetic devices.
      </para>
      <para>
       * Analysis of the three dimensional structures of proteins has included a surface protein (neuraminidase) of the influenza virus (Division of Protein Chemistry). The information has given a new direction to the development of drugs to combat `flu.
      </para>
      <para>
       * Studies of allergenic properties of foods includes attempts to isolate and characterise the responsible proteins (Division of Food Research and Wheat Research Unit). The purified proteins may be effective in desensitising allergy sufferers.
      </para>
      <para>
       * Monoclonal antibodies, which are used to study animal cell growth and differentiation (Division of Molecular Biology), have been prepared against human hormones for use as diagnostic agents.
      </para>
      <para>
       When CSIRO research yields findings with human health significance, the Organisation attempts to develop collaboration with medical scientists in hospitals or universities in order to take the research further. CSIRO has a Medical Research Liaison Committee which assists in promoting such collaboration. From time to time CSIRO receives funds from external funding bodies such as the National Health and Medical Research Council, the National Biotechnology Scheme, and State Cancer Councils, as well as from industry. CSIRO's estimated expenditure of funds from these sources in 1985-86; for research with human health implications is approximately $500,000.

       The information sought is not available from Department records. The Department's statistics are by-products of the claim assessment process and there is no provision on unemployment benefit claim forms to record whether a beneficiary's address is the same as that of his/her parents.
      </para>
      <para>
       Labour force data from the Australian Bureau of Statistics, however, indicate that about 85 per cent of unemployed persons under 21 years are ``members of a family''. If the proportion of unemployment beneficiaries under 21 years living with their parents is similar, the number of such beneficiaries living with their parents was about 120,000 at August 1985 (the latest date for which such information is available). Separate figures for individual States and Territories cannot be calculated, owing to insufficient data.

      <para>
       The Minister for Resources and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:
      </para>
      <para>
       There have been inquiries into the petroleum industry stretching back to the 1960s. As well as the regular, non-public, company specific inquiries conducted by the predecessors of the Prices Surveillance Authority (PSA) namely the Prices Justification Tribunal (PJT) and the Petroleum Products Pricing Authority (PPPA), there have been a number of wide ranging inquiries conducted by these and other bodies. The PSA completed an inquiry into petroleum product prices in July 1984.
      </para>
      <para>
       As foreshadowed in the 1984 inquiry, the PSA is also currently conducting an inquiry into the wholesale base price of motor spirit and distillate. The refinery companies are currently providing confidential information to the PSA on the absolute level of costs in these operations.
      </para>
      <para>
       On 31 May 1985, Senator the Hon. John Button, the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, gave the Industries Assistance Commission (IAC) a reference to conduct a wide ranging inquiry into customs and excise duty arrangements, sales tax and subsidies applicable to petroleum products.
      </para>
      <para>
       Retail prices are set by the refining companies, their distributors and agents. These prices naturally reflect differences in supply costs and in the levels of competition.
      </para>
      <para>
       The major aspect of petrol pricing over which the Commonwealth exercises some influence is the determination of the import parity price (IPP) of crude oil. This policy was introduced by our predecessors and has been reviewed on a number of occasions, most recently in May/June 1985.
      </para>
      <para>
       The principle of IPP is that Australian prices should be comparable with world market prices so that Australian crude oil is priced at its replacement cost. The IPP policy provides a strong incentive for appropriate decisions to be made in the community in relation to energy conservation, petroleum exploration, interfuel substitution and development of alternative energy sources and fuels.

        —The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       I note that the honourable member's question is very wide. It appears to include Commonwealth, State and Territory Ministers, Judges and public officials and also to include legal aid granted by State and Territory Commissions as well as by the Commonwealth.
      </para>
      <para>
       Further, there is a question whether the expression `legal aid' applies not only to legal aid as normally understood and financial assistance schemes but also to restricted schemes for legal assistance, such as provision by the Commonwealth of the defence of:
      </para>
      <para>
       (a) Commonwealth officers under the Finance Directions;
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) Commonwealth Ministers under the Guidelines approved by Cabinet; and
      </para>
      <para>
       (c) Commonwealth Ministers who are only being sued on behalf of the Commonwealth or on the basis of an official action as Minister (eg. a decision to deport a person): in such cases, although the Minister would be represented by the Australian Government Solicitor, there would normally be payments by the Commonwealth of counsel's fees and other expenses.
      </para>
      <para>
       There is no central record in the Attorney-General's Department of payments of the kind referred to in the preceding paragraph. Nor am I aware of any other Department's having such a central record. Payments referred to in paragraphs (a) and (c) are made by the Department concerned in the particular case and payments referred to in paragraph (b) are made by the Department of the Special Minister of State.
      </para>
      <para>
       Whilst a search of individual files held by the Central Office of the Attorney-General's Department and by the Director of Legal Services in each State and Territory should disclose the amount of these payments, this would be a huge task and in my view would be an unreasonable diversion of resources. Without such a search it is impossible to answer the question in so far as it relates to those types of payments.
      </para>
      <para>
       So far as general legal aid schemes are concerned, information on aid granted by the Legal Aid Commissions of the States and the Australian Capital Territory cannot be provided because the Commissions are independent statutory bodies established under legislation of the States concerned and the ACT. The Commissions are required by that legislation to maintain client confidentiality. Under long established policy, information on aid granted by the Australian Legal Aid Office (ALAO) is accorded the same degree of confidentiality as would apply between a solicitor and his or her client.
      </para>
      <para>
       I note however that the Legal Aid Commissions of the States and the ACT and the ALAO apply their eligibility criteria equally to all applicants regardless of position or status. Accordingly, the possibility of the persons referred to in the question being eligible under the guidelines on means applied by those bodies seems extremely remote.
      </para>
      <para>
       Accordingly, I have confined my answer to payments by the Attorney-General's Department of financial assistance towards legal costs pursuant to any scheme administered by that Department (outside the general legal aid framework and the circumstances set out in the second paragraph above) and assistance made by other Departments after endorsement by the Attorney-General's Department of costs submitted for endorsement for payment pursuant to such a scheme.

       (1) The Prime Minister wrote to the Premier of Queensland on 13 April 1985 informing the Premier of the Government's acute concern at Queensland's handling of the industrial dispute in the electricity industry in that State. That letter also informed the Premier of the depth of the Government's concern at the passage of legislation in Queensland which does not take account of rights and processes which have long been accepted in Australia and which is in clear breach of a number of international treaties. Details of the breaches of international treaties, including ILO Conventions and Article 8 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, were provided to the Premier.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Premier replied on 14 April 1985 contesting the Government's view concerning breach of ILO Conventions. The Premier's reply ignored the breach of Article 8 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.

       After the tabling of the Human Rights Commission Report No. 12, I drew the findings of the Human Rights Commission to the attention of the Queensland Minister for Justice and Attorney-General and urged the Queensland Government to take immediate steps to repeal the offending legislation. No action has been taken by the Queensland Government to amend or repeal the legislation.

       (2) and (3) The Australian Bill of Rights Bill was passed by the House on 15 November 1985. The proposed Australian Bill of Rights is based on the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Article 20 of the Bill of Rights, which provides that no person shall be held in slavery or servitude or be required to perform forced or compulsory labour, implements Article 8 of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The proposed new Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission (established by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission Bill) is given power under the Australian Bill of Rights Bill to inquire into Commonwealth and State legislation and acts and practices of Commonwealth and State instrumentalities for the purpose of determining whether they are in conflict with the Bill of Rights. However, the Australian Bill of Rights will not override State laws.

      <para>
       (1) Information on land holdings of corporations which are companies, incorporated bodies, or statutory authorities not subject to the Lands Acquisition Act 1955 is not held by my Department because these bodies are responsible for acquisition and management of their own property.
      </para>
      <para>
       However, my Department has endeavoured to identify all Commonwealth bodies which own land in the Blacktown and City of Penrith local government areas and I have attached a schedule incorporating the names and addresses of the bodies concerned.
      </para>
      <para>
       You will note that the Commonwealth Banking Corporation is one of the authorities identified as owning property in the areas concerned. Although my Department is unable to provide any information concerning the Bank's arrangements for the payment of rates, it has written to the Bank seeking its co-operation in providing you with the information sought.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Department of Finance Directions 13/22-24 state that payments in lieu of rates to local authorities may be made in certain circumstances (details are attached). The Directions are applicable to all departments and statutory authorities subject to the Audit Act.
      </para>
      <para>
       Those statutory authorities not subject to the Audit Act are free to make their own policy arrangements. Of those authorities listed in the Attachment the Australian Postal Commission, the Australian Telecommunications Commission, the Overseas Telecommunications Commission and the Commonwealth Banking Corporation are in this category.
      </para>
      <para>
       While responsibility for any payment to local authorities rests with the individual department/authority concerned, my Department's records indicate payments made in 1984/85 as set out in the attached schedules. These payments exclude service charges such as electricity, water and garbage.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) I am unable to provide this information as the level of rate charges is a matter for individual assessment by the rating authorities concerned.

       PAYMENTS TO LOCAL AUTHORITIES
      </para>
      <para>
       The circumstances under which payments may be made to local authorities for Commonwealth owned or leased properties are set out in Department of Finance Directions 13/22 to 13/24.
      </para>
      <para>
       These provide as follows:
      </para>
      <para>
       Payments for services rendered by a rating authority such as water, sewerage, electricity or garbage services.
      </para>
      <para>
       Payment for an amount equivalent to local rates where a lessee or tenant of the Commonwealth pays to the Commonwealth either as a separate amount or within the rental an amount deemed to be in lieu of rates.
      </para>
      <para>
       Payment of an amount equivalent to local rates where the property is used in the field of commercial enterprise.
      </para>
      <para>
       Payment of an amount equivalent to local rates where the Commonwealth is recovering in whole or in part, its costs of providing the facilities and services for that property.
      </para>
      <para>
       Payment of an amount equivalent to local rates where the property has erected on it a home or other residential building which is used solely for domestic purposes.
      </para>
      <para>
       Payments in the form of contributions towards the construction of roads, footpaths, kerbing or guttering on land abutting the property where, under the appropriate State Legislation or Council by-law, it is the normal practice of local authorities to recover contributions from private landholders and the Commonwealth requested or agreed that the work be done.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Finance Directions also require that when making payments a department or a statutory authority which is subjected to the Directions take into account any expenditure incurred on services normally provided by a local authority in respect of that property.

       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) The Department of Aviation administers two financial assistance programs under which organisations may apply for funding:
      </para>
      <para>
       (i) Grants in aid are made available to non-government groups or organisations for non-profit making activities which benefit the community, directly or indirectly, in a demonstrable way.
      </para>
      <para>
       (ii) Financial assistance is also available to self- regulating aviation bodies. The criterion adopted for this form of assistance is similar to that adopted in the case of grants in aid. Funds are provided directly from the Department's appropriation to those non-government bodies which undertake regulatory functions on its behalf.
      </para>
      <para>
       None of the statutory authorities under the Aviation portfolio have financial assistance programs.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Yes.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) The organisations seeking funds from the available assistance programs administered by the Department of Aviation are not ethnic based nor do the criteria for eligibility address any particular ethnic aspects. Relevant criteria for an organisation seeking assistance under these programs are that it should be national in character and representative of parties concerned. It must have a formal democratic constitution, appropriate expertise and be able to provide some input either monetary or non-monetary in nature.

      <para>
       It is not possible to answer the question in the form sought. Regional Newsletters are produced quarterly. NSW prints 5,000 copies for $1,300; Victoria 1,750 copies for $1,300; Queensland 4,500 copies for $2,500; Western Australia 1,200 copies for $1,500; South Australia 2,000 copies for $1,000; Darwin 2,000 copies for $1,000 and Alice Springs 2,000 copies for $1,250. The aims of the Newsletters are similar to those of the national newsletter, although they understandably concentrate their attention on regional issues and are distributed to Regional organisations, both Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal.

       Background Notes
      </para>
      <para>
       Again the answer cannot be supplied in precisely the way requested. However, Background Note leaflets are produced on Aboriginal health, education, employment and training, infant mortality, art and culture, housing, law and justice and homeland centres. These are produced by the Media and Communications Section in co-operation with relevant departmental branches and updated, as required. They are printed, through AGPS, by a Melbourne printer with a print run of 20,000 copies. They are distributed to emphasise Government programs and policies. The Director, Media and Communications, has editorial control. The printing costs vary with the number of pages of each leaflet, ranging from $2,540 for 20,000 of a six-page, four-colour leaflet to a two-sided single sheet costing $750 for 10,000 copies.

       CSIRO has a diverse range of computers. Many of these computers were acquired as components of laboratory equipment such as mass spectrometers, electron microscopes and auto analysers. In these situations the computer may be dedicated to controlling the operations of the apparatus and/or to logging data. It would not be practicable to produce an exhaustive list of all the brands of computers in use by CSIRO. However, the major suppliers of equipment used in CSIRO are Control Data Corporation, Digital Equipment Corporation, Facom, Hewlett Packard, NEC, Apple, Wang, Convergent Technologies and Philips.

       The first six computer systems listed are installed at CSIRONET, Canberra and form part of the bureau service which provides interactive computing facilities for CSIRO, arms of Government, tertiary educational institutions, and industry through a computing network. CSIRONET generally operates on a cost recovery basis. The CSIRONET network links the central computers in Canberra with smaller computers in all State capitals and other centres in various parts of Australia. CSIRONET also conducts research and development projects on advanced computer operating systems, image processing, computer graphics and typesetting, data base management systems, computer communications, software engineering and information systems.

       (2) There is no single project. In regard to the Education portfolio, I asked the Curriculum Development Centre, which is part of the Commonwealth Schools Commission, to investigate what was happening in the area of electoral education at the Commonwealth level. The CDC convened a meeting of all groups involved to assess the current level of activity. The press release indicated the projects that had been completed or were in progress. These projects include:
      </para>
      <para>
       Production of brochures, posters etc for issue to the general public, especially young people and for use by Commission staff when making school visits.
      </para>

It should be noted, however, that the dates referred to are part of the copyrighting process and are not displayed primarily for the information of viewers.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) A large majority of programs purchased by the ABC use Roman numerals following the C (copyright) symbol and it would not be possible for the Corporation, when purchasing the television rights to these programs, to direct that Arabic numerals should be employed. However, the ABC will ensure that in future the copyright accreditation after its own productions is written in Arabic numerals.

However my officers are currently evaluating the facility with a view to introducing it on a pilot study in one State in the near future. The cost of maintaining a toll-free service could be very high since each free call would result in the Department being charged the normal trunk rate.

       (1) Has the Minister's attention been drawn to a recent survey entitled `Graduates in the Labour Market'.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) If so, does it show (a) almost no unemployment amongst graduates and (b) that the median salary of graduates within five years of graduation is 21 per cent higher than average male weekly earnings and that for medical and dental graduates following five years of study the median salary is 60 per cent above average male weekly earnings.
      </para>

       (3) Does this suggest that university graduates could afford to repay some of the costs of their tertiary education.

       (1) Yes.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) (a) The survey shows that unemployment rates for graduates, five years after graduation, were 2.4 per cent for men and 4.5 per cent for women. It should be noted, however, that the 1984 Survey by the Graduate Careers Council of Australia of over 25,000 graduates from all Australian Universities in the year of gradu-ation showed that 5.9 per cent were not working and were seeking full time work.
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) The survey shows earnings, five years after graduation, of graduates who were in full time employment in both the year after graduation and five years after graduation (that is, those graduates who may have been expected to have had five years full time employment following graduation). The 21 per cent represents an average percentage margin over average weekly earnings for 20 different fields of study. The table shows that there is considerable variation between fields of study, with graduates in medicine and dentistry on average having annual salaries about 60 per cent above average weekly earnings while for pharmacy graduates the average was 1 per cent below average weekly earnings. The full table shows the extent of the variations:

       The survey also shows that the relative earnings of graduates, on graduation, in relation to average weekly earnings had undergone a consistent decline since 1968-69. By 1983 the salary of a first degree graduate at the date of graduation was 80 per cent of average weekly earnings whereas in 1977 it had been approximately 97 per cent.

       </para>

      <para>
       (1) A manned control tower is required for scheduled turbo-jet passenger aircraft operations, unless otherwise specifically authorised by the Secretary to my Department.
      </para>
      <para>
       This requirement was first established with the introduction of turbo-jet aircraft to Australian regular public transport services in the mid 1960s.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Not specifically. However, as an example, the United States Federal Regulations are similar to the Australian rules for the provision of ATC for regular public transport aircraft, in that specific approval is required from the FAA Administrator for Domestic and Flag Air Carrier operations outside controlled airspace.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) The requirement was established by the Department in recognition of International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) Standards and Recommended Practices concerning the provision of Air Traffic Services. Australia is required to take account of those standards and Recommended Practices as a signatory to the Chicago Convention.
      </para>
      <para>
       The matter was reviewed before the introduction of F28 aircraft to regional airline routes in 1969. The most recent review however was conducted before the introduction of the F28 aircraft to NSW regional airlines service in 1982.
      </para>

       (4) There are 29 airports in Australia which have control towers staffed by civilian air traffic controllers. Three more towers are being planned.

       (5) The staff establishment for manning the 29 civil control towers is 255, with a further staff requirement of 11 for those towers being planned.

       There was a proposal by the Soviet Union to establish a floating dry-dock facility in Western Australia. However, this proposal was rejected by the Western Australian Government in July 1985.
      </para>
      <para>
       As far as any application to the Commonwealth Government is concerned, in August 1984 the Minister for Transport received correspondence from Elders East Europe (Australia), a division of Elders IXL Ltd, seeking approval in principle to import two floating dry docks for use in Western Australia.

       Officers of the Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce sought a meeting with Elders East Europe to discuss the shipbuilding policy aspects of the request, however, this meeting never eventuated.

      <para>
       On 4 January 1985, the Minister for Transport wrote to Elders East Europe asking if they still wished to proceed with the request and as no reply has been received the application has been regarded as lapsed.

       However, the established patterns of atmospheric circulation in the two hemispheres usually lead to airborne debris from a nuclear explosion at Mururoa, Lop Nor or Semipalatinsk being carried eastward from the explosion site. Even for high yield explosions, injecting debris into the stratosphere, most of the fallout would occur in the band of latitudes centred on the latitude of the test site. Fallout would not be expected to move directly to Australia by the shortest routes listed above. For example, with a nuclear explosion at Mururoa, the airborne debris would travel more than 25,000 kilometres eastwards around the world before reaching Australia.

       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) The survey referred to was commissioned by an independent committee set up by the CSIRO Executive to review the Organisation's external communication activities. I was given a copy of the committee's report, which included the results of the survey. The report was released publicly and received widespread publicity.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2 and 3) The review committee emphasised that it was making a judgment of CSIRO's communication performance based largely on community perceptions. It was not a judgment of CSIRO's actual performance of its research role nor of the attitudes of CSIRO management.
      </para>
      <para>
       More than 85 per cent of the respondents in the survey regarded CSIRO's technical competence as either good or excellent. Most considered CSIRO to have been successful in the past, with the potential to assist Australian industry.
      </para>
      <para>
       The survey also highlighted the lack of knowledge of CSIRO by the sample of opinion leaders and this, I believe, is the real problem. In particular, more than half of the manufacturers surveyed did not know whether CSIRO had research capabilities which could be useful to them-a most disturbing finding.
      </para>
      <para>
       While the survey drew attention to CSIRO's communication problems, industry's reluctance to inform itself about CSIRO and establish contacts with the Organisation must be a significant contributor to these problems.
      </para>
      <para>
       In recent years in Australia, as in other industrial nations, there has been a growing awareness of the need to improve links between science and industry. CSIRO has been very conscious of this need, particularly in relation to manufacturing industry (its links with agriculture and mining have been generally very effective).
      </para>
      <para>
       CSIRO has taken a number of major initiatives to rectify the situation over the past five years, and since I became Minister I have given them every encouragement and support in this task.
      </para>
      <para>
       Its links with the manufacturing and service sectors have already shown dramatic improvements. The past year or so has seen CSIRO, in collaboration with industry, begin the commercialisation of a growing number of world-class manufacturing technologies that have substantial export potential.
      </para>
      <para>
       Most recently the Organisation has appointed a Director of Information and Public Communication to give further impetus to its communication activities.
      </para>
      <para>
       CSIRO has had a formal mechanism for industrial democracy, the Consultative Council, since 1978. The council, which comprises representatives of CSIRO staff associations and management, advises the Executive on staff matters including, for example, equal opportunity and internal communications. The Council is currently considering proposals for extending industrial democracy procedures throughout CSIRO.

      <para>
       (1) To whom was the minute (M119-4-7), dated 25 June 1984, issued from the central office of his Department, concerning misuse of carburettor icing in light aircraft, circulated, in particular, which flying schools received a copy.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Was a copy of the minute sent to the General Aviation Association; if so, was it intended to correct an instruction included in a letter from his Department to the Association, dated 26 June 1979.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) Has his attention been drawn to a 1973 US Federal Aviation Agency air safety circular concerning carburettor ice; if so, when did (a) he and (b) his Department become aware of it.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) Does the circular detail 40 fatalities as a result of engine failure caused by carburettor ice.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) Was his Department's instruction on the use of carburettor heat contrary to the recommendations of the Federal Aviation Agency air safety circular at any time from 1971 to June 1984.
      </para>
      <para>

        —The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) The minute of 25 June 1984, reference M1194/7, is an intra-Departmental document and was distributed to all Regions of my Department. It was not distributed to any outside organisation.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) No.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) My Department did not receive a copy of the 1973 Advisory Circular on carburettor icing from the FAA. A copy, which appears to be a composite photocopy of parts of an original, was received by my Department from a member of the public in 1983.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) The advisory circular mentions induction ice as a probable cause in a number of accidents. These findings are by no means conclusive and indicate only that induction icing can neither be eliminated nor confirmed as a cause in those accidents.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) My Department's policy does not vary from that mentioned in the FAA advisory circular. In each instance the engine or aircraft manufacturer's recommendations regarding the use of carburettor heat must be followed. My Department's position has not changed during the period 1971-1984.
      </para>
      <para>
       (6) From 1971 to 1984, there were 145 incidents and 32 accidents in Australia where carburettor icing is known or suspected to have been a factor, resulting in 6 minor injuries and 2 fatalities. The details are as follows:

       (7) No. Licensed flying schools in Australia are required to operate and instruct in accordance with the Australian Air Navigation Regulations. Their aircraft must be operated in accordance with the manufacturers recommendations, including those on carburettor icing, as contained in the appropriate Aircraft Flight Manual, Operations Manual or Pilots Operating Handbook. My Department's policy on carburettor icing does not vary from that mentioned in the FAA advisory circular.

       (2) and (3) No. Within Australia, the States and Territories have responsibility for administering domestic food laws including ensuring that imported food complies with domestic standards. Apart from the application of Quarantine Regulations and Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulations, there are no comprehensive Commonwealth inspection arrangements for imported foods either at the place of manufacture or point of entry. Commonwealth involvement is largely limited to the administration of quarantine control, tariffs and prohibited imports.
      </para>
      <para>
       My major concern at present is to achieve uniformity of food Acts, Regulations and Standards as they apply to all foods sold in Australia, whether of domestic or imported origin. The question of reviewing manufacturing conditions for food and beverages in overseas countries exporting to Australia is not at this time seen as a practicable alternative.

      <para>
       (2) The process for the nomination of places in Australia for possible inclusion on the World Heritage List was discussed and agreed upon at the July 1984 meeting of the Council of Nature Conservation Ministers (CONCOM). This Council consists of Commonwealth, State and Territory Ministers responsible for wildlife conservation and national parks. Following the CONCOM agreement I wrote to appropriate State and Territory Ministers and invited them to submit suggestions of places to be examined with a view to possible future nomination to the World Heritage List. In reply to this letter, the Western Australian Minister for the Environment, the Hon. Ron Davies, M.L.A., wrote to me on 31 July 1985 indicating that three places in Western Australia appeared to warrant immediate consideration for nomination to the World Heritage List. Shark Bay was one of these three places.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) In his letter, Mr Davies stressed that no formal decision had been made to proceed with the nomination of any of the three places. There were still a number of impediments to nomination which include prior development of appropriate management plans and the provision of adequate staff. In response to Mr Davies' letter, discussions have taken place between the Western Australian Government and the Commonwealth Government at both the Ministerial level and officer level on all aspects of the nomination process and these are continuing at present. I would like to make it quite clear that the Commonwealth Government will not take any action concerning World Heritage Listing without prior consultations with the State Government in line with the CONCOM agreement. The views of local government and interested persons including local residents will be taken into account during these consultations. This is a point which I stressed during my visit to Shark Bay.

       (b) Under the Trans Tasman Travel Agreement (TTTA), citizens of New Zealand are exempt from the requirement to obtain a visa or entry permit and may reside in Australia without undergoing migration processing. The tables below show the numbers of New Zealand citizens who arrived for permanent settlement from 1975 (as self described on the incoming passenger card), and those who have changed status to permanent resident in the same period.
      </para>
      <para>
       Change of status is required for New Zealand citizens who entered Australia as prohibited non-citizens or who became prohibited non-citizens after arrival. New Zealand prohibited non-citizens are not exempt under TTTA and in order to regularise their status in Australia must be issued with an endorsed entry permit. New Zealand citizens who hold citizenship of another country (dual nationals) may also wish to undergo change of status processing in order to obtain evidence of their resident status in their non-New Zealand passport.

       Visits for prosthetic/orthotic related services do not attract Isolated Patients Travel and Accommodation Assistance Scheme (IPTAAS) benefits unless a medical specialist is consulted on each visit. However, a joint Commonwealth/State working party is presently reviewing IPTAAS and patient transport generally; the question of assistance for paramedical services is being considered. There are no other programs administered by my Department which will assist people required to travel for paramedical services such as the fitting of shoes or callipers.

       My understanding is that there is no Commonwealth assistance for travel under the Program of Aids for Disabled People administered by my colleague, the Minister for Community Services.

      <para>
       In 1981 the Joint Standing Committee on the new Parliament House resolved that a child care facility not be included in the new building but that planning provision be made for such a facility in the grounds of the complex.

        —The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) Since its establishment as a Statutory Authority in 1976, the Australian National Gallery has acquired approximately 37,000 works of art. In addition, approximately 19,000 works held by the Gallery were acquired by various Government bodies before 1976. All works of art have been identified and accessioned and the Gallery is presently converting these records to computer.
      </para>
      <para>
       The tasks of manually producing a complete list of all works in the Collection in the form requested is not practical at this stage. However, Australian National Gallery Annual Reports issued since 1976 contain lists of all works acquired by the Gallery by purchase or gift. A list of works of art acquired prior to 1976 is not available at present.
      </para>
      <para>
       No records of current market value are maintained.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) (a) The names of vendors will be available when the new computer system is complete.
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) The Gallery has access to the following sources of funds for purchase of works of art-
      </para>
      <para>
       Annual appropriation
      </para>
      <para>
       Admission fees
      </para>
      <para>

      <para>
       Catering fees
      </para>
      <para>
       Shop sales surpluses
      </para>
      <para>
       Excluding the last category, all purchases from funds other than appropriation are credited in the Annual Report.
      </para>
      <para>
       (c) and (d) When purchasing works of art, the Gallery deals directly with the vendor or auction house. In the latter case a standard fee applies which is included in the purchase price. It is not practicable to produce a separate list of all objects purchased at auction.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) (a) Since the Gallery opened in 1982 it has received 245 inward loans. Names of lenders of works are shown in the Gallery's Annual Reports.
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) The Gallery maintains standard terms and conditions for incoming loans. These conditions were designed in consultation with the Attorney-General's Department and a formal document is completed for each loan.
      </para>
      <para>
       Special loan agreements are prepared for major exhibitions.
      </para>
      <para>
       (c) The Gallery complies with any terms and con- ditions that apply to works which it accepts on loan.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) (a) The names of donors are listed in the Gallery's Annual Reports.
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) This information is not available at present. The new computer system, referred to above, will provide access to a record of conditions relating to donations.
      </para>
      <para>
       (c) As a matter of policy the Gallery does not accept donations of works which contain conditions that the Gallery could not meet.

      <para>
       The recently announced taxation changes have no impact on the deductibility of legitimate business expenses for taxation purposes. To the extent that sport sponsorships are undertaken for bona fide advertising purposes they have been, and remain, tax deductible.
      </para>
      <para>
       It is possible that the tax changes may have had an influence on some sponsorship in the context of a company reviewing its overall position in relation to the changes. However, there is no evidence of any direct effects on sponsorship levels, and to my knowledge no sporting events have been cancelled.

       I have asked for this kind of information from the Confederation of Australian Sport, but until there is a response from that organisation on sponsorship levels, I am unable to comment further on this matter.

As an example, the Department has been unable to create any `identified' positions which would require an understanding and appreciation of Aboriginal culture.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Department has continued to participate in the National Employment Strategy for Aboriginals (NESA) scheme through provision of traineeships and apprenticeships, has sought Clerks and Clerical Assistants through the Aboriginal Services recruitment campaign conducted by the Public Service Board and has sponsored Aboriginal staff under the Aboriginal Study Programs administered by the Public Service Board.
      </para>
      <para>
       Earlier this year the Equal Employment Opportunity (EEO) Unit established within my Department identified the employment and training of Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders as an issue requiring concentrated effort. As a result the Departmental EEO Management Plan which was submitted to the Public Service Board in September 1985 specifically addresses the issue of increasing the recruitment and training opportunities of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders.

        —The Minister for Community Services has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) Commonwealth funding to youth refuges and related support services for homeless youth in 1982-83 was approximately $3.157 million. Funding was provided under a number of programs including the Youth Services Scheme, the Homeless Persons Assistance Program and the Children's Services Program.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Commonwealth funding for services for homeless youth has received a significant increase with the introduction of the Supported Accommodation Assistance Program (SAAP) from 1 January 1985. SAAP subsumed a number of Commonwealth and State programs providing supported accommodation to homeless people to develop a co-ordinated approach to service delivery through the introduction of one joint Commonwealth-State program. SAAP includes 3 sub-programs: the Youth Supported Accommodation Program (YSAP); the Women's Emergency Services Program (WESP); and the General Supported Accommodation Program (GASP).
      </para>
      <para>
       Funding provided for SAAP by the Commonwealth is not earmarked for expenditure by sub-program. Funding is allocated among sub-programs by the Commonwealth Minister following consultations with the State Ministers and it reflects the particular service needs and priorities for each group of clients within a State or Territory.
      </para>
      <para>
       However, in 1984-85 an annual equivalent of $8.726 million, including an amount of $1.7 million per annum specifically for new youth services, was expended on YSAP. This represented approximately 29% of the total Commonwealth SAAP allocations of $24.998 million in a full year. On a similar percentage basis, it is estimated that approximately $9.30 million could be expended on services for youth from the total Commonwealth SAAP allocation of $32.142 for 1985-86.
      </para>
      <para>
       This level of expenditure would result in an increase of approximately 300% over the level of funding provided by the Commonwealth for youth refuges in 1982-83.

      <para>
       (1) In 1982-83 the Commonwealth provided $1.7 million for child care in women's emergency services through the Children's Services Program. State Governments also assisted women's emergency services to a limited extent through their Women's Refuge Programs.

      </para>
      <para>
       Funding allocations under SAAP are not yet finalised for 1985-86. However, based on 1984-85 expenditure it is expected that at least $11.00 million will be allocated to women's emergency services under the WESP sub program of SAAP.
      </para>
      <para>
       Services assisting women in crisis are also eligible under the other sub-programs of SAAP. It is anticipated that the overall SAAP provision for services assisting women in crisis could reach $16.7 million from the total Commonwealth SAAP allocation of $32.12 million in 1985-86.
      </para>
      <para>
       This level of expenditure would result in a tenfold increase over the level of funding provided by the Commonwealth in 1982-83 for women's emergency services.

      <para>
       (1) The Defence Force provides for its members (primarily officers) to undergo broad education in the humanities in a variety of ways. The Single Service Cadet Colleges, shortly to be replaced by the Australian Defence Force Academy (ADFA), have traditionally provided tertiary education in the humanities as well as the sciences. This tradition will continue and be enhanced at ADFA where a greater variety of courses will be offered. In addition, the Single Service Staff Colleges, the Joint Services Staff College and the various overseas Staff Colleges utilized by the Defence Forces provide a further liberal education for those destined for senior positions. Members (of all ranks) may also further their education in the humanities under assisted study schemes such as the Defence Force Assisted Study Scheme, the Services Vocational and Educational Training Scheme, and the Civil Schooling Scheme. Defence Fellowships are also offered annually and several have made important contributions to original research in the social sciences.

      <para>
       (1) Yes. I would refer the honourable member to the statement made by the Prime Minister in Parliament on 2 April 1984, in which he said:
      </para>
      <para>
       ``I can state categorically that the Government has never made any decision to acquire or develop a nuclear capability and has no intention of doing so; nor has the Cabinet or any Cabinet committee discussed the possible development of a nuclear capability by Australia`'.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) As the honourable member is aware, the long-standing convention is that successive governments do not have access to the Cabinet records of previous governments. I am therefore, unable to say whether past governments have or have not opposed a nuclear component for the Australian Defence Force. It would be surprising, however, if consideration had not been given by one or more of the Australian governments in the period between 1945 and the ratification of the Non-Proliferation Treaty in 1973, to the advantages and disadvantages, and costs, of acquiring a nuclear capability.

       Funding for the Adult Migrant Education Program (AMEP) has increased from $34.2m in 1982-83 to $45.4m in 1985-86. Cost increases account for $9.2m of the difference. Real increases in provisions however amount to $3.7m, $2.0m within the AMEP appropriation and $1.7m transferred to other appropriations but still spent on the AMEP. These transfers include the salary costs of full-time Bilingual Information Officers and child care/utility provisions at Migrant Centres.

        —The answer to the honourable member's question in respect of Australia is as follows:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (a) Hydrology
      </para>
      <para>
       The possible use of Antarctic icebergs as a fresh water resource is a major area of hydrological interest. The Australian Antarctic Division does not conduct any major studies of icebergs but iceberg numbers and sizes are monitored on some voyages to Antarctica. These data are used to derive statistical estimates of iceberg distribution, size and melt rates. Measurements of ocean characteristics around icebergs have also been made (on an `opportunity basis' only) to obtain data on the processes of iceberg melt.
      </para>
      <para>
       The overall hydrological balance of Antarctica is determined by processes of snow fall, ice flow and iceberg calving. A major aim of the glaciology programs of the Antarctic Division (particularly the traverse program) is to determine the mass budget (hydrological balance) of Antarctica.
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) Glaciology
      </para>
      <para>
       Glaciological research is a major component of the Antarctic Division's science program. The main objectives of the glaciology program are:
      </para>
      <para>
       To achieve a comprehensive understanding of the nature of both the Antarctic ice sheet and the surrounding region of floating sea ice and their interaction with the atmospheric and oceanic environments.
      </para>
      <para>
       To monitor the Antarctic ice sheet for mass balance changes that reflect and influence world sea levels.
      </para>
      <para>
       To document the detailed record of environmental changes over the last 250,000 years which exists in the ice by the recovery and analysis of deep ice cores.
      </para>
      <para>
       To construct from data collected in the field and laboratory a numerical model of the present ice sheet and to calculate its past history, future changes, and the global implications of such changes.
      </para>
      <para>
       Specific projects contributing to this program include:
      </para>
      <para>
       1. Major oversnow traverses covering (or planned to cover) most of the Australian Antarctic Territory. A wide range of measurements on ice sheet dynamics, ice sheet morphology, geophysics, etc is collected during these traverses which have been ongoing since the early 1970's. The traverses contribute to a multi-national cooperative study of the east Antarctic ice sheet (International Antarctic Glaciological Program).
      </para>
      <para>
       2. Deep core drilling to recover ancient ice for climatic studies and to investigate the dynamics of the ice at depth in the ice sheet. Most ice core drilling by Australia to date has been undertaken on the Law Dome, a small local ice cap on the edge of the ice sheet near Casey. A new ice coring drill is currently being developed which will allow deep cores (several thousand metres) to be extracted from the main ice sheet.
      </para>
      <para>
       3. Detailed studies of the dynamics of outlet glaciers. Near the edge of the ice sheet, the slowly moving ice is funnelled into a number of quicker moving ice streams which drain much of the ice from Antarctica. Understanding of the dynamics of these streams is necessary to estimate the mass balance of the whole ice sheet, and how it may respond to environmental change. Detailed ice velocity data have been obtained from ground surveys of outlet glaciers, and from aerial sounding of ice thickness, surface elevation, etc.
      </para>
      <para>
       4. Interaction of the ice sheet and the atmosphere. The Antarctic ice sheet is the major heat sink for global atmospheric circulation. Surface winds over the ice sheet are controlled by radiation loss from the ice sheet surface and the ice sheet topography. To study these:
      </para>
      <para>
       automatic weather stations are deployed along traverse routes; and
      </para>
      <para>
       balloon and kite soundings have been made of the structure of the wind in the lower layers of the atmosphere over the ice sheet.
      </para>
      <para>
       5. Sea ice. The annual growth and decay of sea ice around Antarctica modifies heat exchange between the ocean and atmosphere and changes the density structure of the ocean and is thus important to both atmospheric and oceanic circulation.
      </para>
      <para>
       Detailed process studies of interaction between ice, ocean and atmosphere were conducted at Mawson during the 1970's and early 1980's.
      </para>
      <para>
       Sea ice thickness is regularly measured at all Australian mainland bases.
      </para>
      <para>
       Drifting data buoys are used to track sea ice drift and to monitor ocean and atmospheric temperatures.
      </para>
      <para>
       Sea ice extent and concentration is monitored from satellite data.
      </para>
      <para>
       Sea ice properties and characteristics are measured in the pack ice zone during some marine science cruises.
      </para>
      <para>
       6. Ice mechanics
      </para>
      <para>
       The mechanical properties of ice are studied in laboratory experiments in Australia.
      </para>
      <para>
       Compaction and mechanical properties of snow with reference to its use for airfield construction, have been studied in the laboratory (University of Melbourne) and in the field.
      </para>
      <para>
       7. Numerical models
      </para>
      <para>
       Using process information and data collected in the field and laboratory, computer models have been developed which simulate the Antarctic ice sheet and with which the response of the ice sheet to a changing external environment can be estimated (with University of Melbourne).
      </para>
      <para>
       8. Natural compaction and properties of snow and ice. Snow crystal and grain structure, temperature and densifications are being studied near Casey (with Lanchow Institute of Glaciology, China).
      </para>
      <para>
       (c) Climatology
      </para>

       Yes. The development of policies and objectives for the conservation and protection of the Australian coastline was proposed to the Australian Environment Council (AEC) in July 1984. Council agreed, inter alia, that the States have primary responsibility for the management of the Australian coastline and that AEC members should exchange information and consider common objectives for the conservation and protection of the Australian coastline.

       In May 1985 the AEC agreed to establish a coastal management liaison network of State, Territory and Commonwealth officers working in the field of coastal management and to sponsor or co-sponsor a conference in 1986 on coastal management and protection from an environmental perspective. The conference is expected to be held in September or October 1986 at Coffs Harbour, New South Wales.

       In 1981 an intensive land review and disposal program was instituted for property holdings of departments and those statutory authorities funded from the Budget.

       The review program has largely been completed and my Department is now changing its focus to an ongoing cyclical review of the efficient utilisation of the Commonwealth's property holdings. The review examines whether different real estate holdings may be more appropriate to the Commonwealth's needs and also ensures that surplus properties are identified and either sold, or, where temporarily surplus, revenue leased or terms and conditions which protect the primary Commonwealth interest.

      <para>
       (1) Section 39B of the Dangerous Drugs Act 1952 was introduced in April 1975 when a penalty of life imprisonment or of death was imposed on persons convicted of trafficking in drugs above certain minimum quantities. Section 39B of the Act was amended in April 1983, when the mandatory death penalty was imposed on drug traffickers and the minimum quantities were changed.
      </para>
      <para>
       A drug trafficker under the amendment of April 1983 is any person convicted of possession of 15 grams (previously 100 grams) or more in weight of heroin and/or morphine (previously heroin or morphine with no combination of both), or 200 grams or more in weight of cannabis, or 1 kilogram or more in weight of raw opium or prepared opium (previously 1 kilogram of prepared opium or 5 kilograms of raw opium).
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Between 1975 and 17 November 1985, 32 persons were executed. Of these one was a woman. None was a foreigner. Malaysian statistics do not give any breakdown on the basis of ethnic origin. Malaysian law makes no mention of couriers or small dealers, but see answer to question (1) above.

From July 1984, base amounts have been determined annually for each State/NT by a formula which takes account of that State/NT's financial capacity calculated by reference to its budget sector revenue and grants. Prior to that date the base amounts were fixed. Up to the base amount, expenditure in a year by a State/NT in respect of eligible disaster relief measures is met entirely by that State/NT. From July 1985, for eligible State/NT expenditure above the base amount but not greater than 1.75 times the base amount, the Commonwealth provides budgetary assistance equal to half the excess amount. For eligible expenditure greater than 1.75 times the base amount, the Commonwealth provides such assistance equal to three quarters of the further excess amount. In earlier years, different formulae applied. Details may be found in Budget Paper No. 7 each year.
      </para>
      <para>
       This assistance is provided by the Department of Finance directly to each State/Northern Territory Treasury. Each State/NT administers its own relief measures and as appropriate applies for financial assistance from the Commonwealth under the provisions of the arrangement.
      </para>
      <para>
       (c) The NSCP provides two categories of grants. A State's component, with grants provided on the basis of a formula and priorities determined by the States in consultation with my Department, and a National component with grants made available to educational institutions, research organisations and community groups or individuals for projects which meet the objectives of the NSCP. The administration at Commonwealth level is provided by my Department. The program operates under the provisions of the Soil Conservation (Financial Assistance) Act 1985.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) (a) The amount of funds allocated by the Commonwealth to the Rural Adjustment Scheme each year is determined in the Budgetary context. From 1985/86, assistance is provided by way of an interest subsidy on borrowings under the Scheme for 7 years. That is, commitments entered into each year from 1985/86 will apply for 7 years. The detailed administration of funds under the RAS is a matter for State/Territory rural adjustment authorities. Individual producers apply for assistance directly to these bodies. All assessment and decisions on eligibility are made at this level.

      <para>
       (b) See 3 (b).
      </para>
      <para>
       (c) Under the NSCP, applications are called for suitable projects from interested parties each year. The States determine the order of priority of projects submitted under the States component in consultation with officers of my Department. Funding is then allocated in order of priority until the amount determined by the formula for each State/Territory is fully utilised. For the National component, projects are recommended for funding by a selection committee comprising members drawn from a variety of relevant fields. To date this has been an ad hoc committee but in future the Soil Conservation Advisory Committee established under the Act will fulfil this role.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) It is not possible to determine whether any project has been funded in any particular electoral division from information held by the Commonwealth for the RAS, NDRA and the State component of the NSCP. This is because the detailed assessment of projects or assistance for these schemes lies with State/Territory authorities. For the National component of the NSCP, I am advised that no applications have been received from the Richmond Electoral Division specifically, thus none have been funded.

       (12) Where the detailed administration of these schemes is a matter for State/Territory governments, the advertising and dissemination of information to potential users is a matter for the appropriate administering body. In relation to the National component of the NSCP, officers of my Department review the advertising requirements prior to calling for applications each year. It is my intention that information on the scheme should be as widely available as possible, while recognising the limits of the Program's budget. Judging by the response to previous advertisements there would appear to be little need to change these arrangements.

       I am advised by the Australian Federal Police (AFP) that no instruction has been issued whereby frauds committed on the Departments of Social Security and Health under the value of $20,000 will not be investigated. While the deployment of AFP staff to more pressing tasks and in areas of greater priority designated by the Government does prevent the AFP from investigating all matters referred by the two Departments, the Government is addressing the problem of AFP resources by the provision of additional funds during this and the next two financial years for the recruitment of a stronger AFP.

       (1) Under the terms of the contract, the Developer/ Builder has only conditional access to the North West corner of the site on which the Law Courts is to be erected adjacent to the proposed Commonwealth Centre. The Arrangement allows for site investigations to be carried out on the Law Courts site preparatory to construction and for the site to be vacated at short notice. Of necessity, the Developer/Builder has unconditional access to the balance of the site.

      <para>
       (3) As the Commonwealth has entered into an arrangement for the purchase of the Parramatta development, there is no rental involved. Conditional use by the Developer/Builder of the Law Courts site is permitted to facilitate the early completion of the Commonwealth Centre building by providing access and enabling location of site sheds well outside the excavation area. The early completion and hence this arrangement is clearly in the Commonwealth's interest.

       (1)-(3) I am advised that in a Media Release dated 29 October 1985, the Chief General Manager of the ANZ Bank, Mr Bob Bennett, said that the Bank had never `backed' Vigor or any other health and fitness centre. Mr Bennett also referred to the fact that the ANZ Bank will, inter alia, compensate its Bankcard customers for losses caused by the closure of several health and fitness centres and noted that customers who already had been to court or a small claims tribunal and had been ordered to repay ANZ Bankcard would also be eligible for refunds or for the waiving of debt, on assessment by a special claims assessor, provided the amount in dispute related to the unused component of the service offered by the fitness centres concerned, and that credit card arrangements were introduced to those customers by the centre. A copy of the Media Release is attached for incorporation in Hansard.

      <para>
       (4) There are no legislative provisions under Commonwealth banking legislation, or other requirements by the Reserve Bank, relating to the arrangements between a banker and a customer regarding the issue and use of credit cards. At the Commonwealth level, consumer protection legislation is embodied in the Trade Practices Act 1974. At present, the Act does not impose any liability on credit providers (such as Bankcard) who finance purchases of services if the supplier of the services commits a breach of the Act. However, on 9 October 1985, the Attorney-General introduced into the Parliament a package of amendments to that Act.
      </para>
      <para>
       The purpose of Clause 37 of the Trade Practices Amendment Bill 1985 is to introduce a new section 73 into the Act, so that `linked' credit providers will be rendered liable jointly and severally with the supplier of the goods and services in certain circumstances. A linked credit provider in this context will include a credit provider to whom the supplier, by prior arrangement with the credit provider, regularly refers persons for the purpose of obtaining credit, or whose offers of credit are made available by the supplier by arrangement with the credit provider. In the case of a contract for the supply of services, it is proposed that the linked credit provider will be liable if the seller does not render the services with due care and skill.

       The Bank said ANZ Bankcard customers who received no service or only some service from these centres will be eligible for a refund or release from their liability if their fees were paid by credit card.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Bank said that refunds or release would be made only to ANZ Bankcard customers who were introduced to credit arrangements by the health and fitness centres which closed.

       Mr Bob Bennett, Chief General Manager of ANZ Bank said that ANZ had never ``backed'' Vigor or any other health and fitness centre, and that the Bank believed, and continues to believe, it has acted responsibly and within the law at all times.

       ``However, we are concerned at the effect of this issue on customers who may have been misinformed of ANZ's connection with these centres.''

       Mr Bennett said that it was now apparent that some customers will be involved through little fault of their own in litigation. ``ANZ's responsibility is to its customers and not solely to legal principles and, for this reason, we are putting our customers first,'' he said.
      </para>

       He added a further concern that many viable and reputable health and fitness centres were still operating, and much recent adverse publicity on the few centres that have closed is threatening their business and the livelihood of their employees. ``Hopefully, following ANZ's announcement today, they will be better placed to pursue their business objectives,'' he said.

       Operational standards require that the aircraft of the type proposed for this operation land at airstrips where the runway is at least 30 metres wide, with an additional graded area on either side of the runway to provide a total width of 90 metres. The airstrip at Tari airport in Papua New Guinea has a runway width of 45 metres, but the total graded area is only 60 metres wide.

       (c) The indexation of excise rates in line with movements in the CPI will not be discounted for the effects of the depreciation of the Australian dollar. The purpose of indexing certain excise rates is to maintain the real value of the impost. The real value of wages will be maintained by a reduction in income tax rates sufficient to compensate employees for the 2 per cent wage increase that they will forgo in the April 1986 wage case.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) No. The six-monthly indexation of excise rates each 1 February and 1 August is designed to maintain, not increase, the real value of excise rates.

       (3) No. As noted in the answer to question (1), the tax cut is structured to compensate employees for the 2 per cent discount of the wage increase.

       Sick leave entitlements in the Australian Public Service (APS) are prescribed, in respect of officers, by Public Service Arbitrator's Determination No. 119 of 1951 and, in respect of temporary employees, by the General Conditions of Service Australian Government Employment Award 1985.
      </para>
      <para>
       Sick leave credits of two weeks on full pay and two weeks on half pay accrue to officers on appointment to the APS and on the completion of each twelve months' service. Sick leave accrues cumulatively during the officer's period of service but no payment is made for unused credits on retirement. Staff are eligible to be considered for up to five days' sick leave absence without production of a medical certificate in any year (of which only three days may be consecutive). Otherwise all sick leave absences must be covered by a medical certificate.
      </para>
      <para>
       Staff temporarily employed in the APS accrue, after two months' employment, and entitlement to one day's paid sick leave for each month of employment up to a maximum entitlement of five days. If they continue to be employed for more than a year, temporary employees have the same entitlements as those prescribed for officers.

       Similar provisions apply to staff of statutory authorities employed under the Public Service Act 1922 or where conditions of service are subject to Public Service Board approval. Leave provisions applying to employment in other statutory authorities are set out in the legislation creating those authorities or are determined by awards of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission.

        —The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) The Secretary to the Department of Aviation has power under the Air Navigation Regulations to vary, suspend or cancel a pilot's licence in the interests of safety.
      </para>
      <para>
       When the Secretary has reason to believe that this action is necessary he or his delegate must first lay before that person in writing the full particulars of the matter and invite him/her to show cause why the licence should not be varied, suspended or cancelled. Upon receipt of this evidence or after the elapse of a reasonable period of time, the Secretary or his delegate may, after considering all of the evidence before him, make up his mind to vary, suspend or cancel the licence. During this procedure the licence may be suspended, pending investigation, for 28 days or until the pilot responds to the ``show cause'' letter.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Secretary also has power under the Regulations to initiate prosecution action against persons for offences against the Regulations.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) (a) and (b) These provisions have generally been applicable since the Regulations came into operation on 10 August 1947. The procedures for administration of the provisions were last amended in 1982.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) The Secretary or his delegate may vary, suspend or cancel a pilot's licence where an investigation has been carried out and he is satisfied that grounds exist to warrant the action, in that the pilot:
      </para>
      <para>
       (a) has contravened or failed to comply with a provision of the Act or Regulations;
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) fails to satisfy or to continue to satisfy any requirement prescribed by, or specified under, these Regulations in relation to the obtaining or holding of such a licence or certificate;
      </para>
      <para>
       (c) has failed in his or her duty with respect to any matter affecting the safe or efficient navigation of an aircraft;
      </para>
      <para>
       (d) is not a fit and proper person to have the responsibilities and exercise and perform the functions and duties of a holder of such a licence or certificate; or
      </para>
      <para>
       (e) has contravened or failed to comply with, a direction or instruction with respect to a matter affecting the safe navigation and operation of an aircraft, being a direction or instruction that is contained in Air Navigation Orders.
      </para>
      <para>
       In these cases there is no formal standard of proof applicable, however a person aggrieved by such a decision may have the decision reviewed by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. As a matter of practice, the Tribunal requires any matters alleged against a pilot to be proved according to the balance of probabilities.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Secretary or his delegate may also suspend a pilot's licence for a nominal period of 28 days to facilitate investigation where he has reason to think that there may exist facts or circumstances that would justify the variation, suspension or cancellation of a licence on a ground as specified above. This is a precautionary measure in the interests of public safety rather than disciplinary action. An exercise of this power therefore does not require determination of the evidence to any standard of proof. However, in accordance with normal legal principles, a suspension pending investigation must be based on reasonable grounds. A pilot may contest the legality of such a suspension in the Federal Court.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Secretary or his delegate may also suspend a pilot's licence while the holder is required to undergo a medical or other examination to ensure his/her continued fitness to hold a licence. This again is a precautionary measure in the interests of public safety rather than disciplinary action.
      </para>
      <para>
       In cases involving prosecution for breaches of air navigation legislation, the person concerned has recourse to all the applicable processes of law, since prosecution generally occurs in State Courts in the same manner as comparable offences.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) The final decision to cancel a pilot's licence may only be taken by the Secretary, the two Deputy Secretaries and the First Assistant Secretary, Flight Standards Division.
      </para>
      <para>
       The final decision to suspend a pilot's licence for a specified period for safety reasons may be taken, in addition to those listed above, by the Regional Directors of the five Regional offices of my Department.
      </para>
      <para>
       The decision to suspend a pilot's licence pending investigation or for the purpose of ensuring his continued fitness to hold a licence may also be taken by the Assistant Regional Director and the Superintendent, Flying Operations, in the Flight Standards Branch of each Region and their equivalents in Central Office.

        —The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) Helicopters are required to be manoeuvred from the parking area to a place from which a departure can be initiated without conflicting with or constituting a hazard to other aircraft taking off or landing at the aerodrome.
      </para>
      <para>
       The honourable member may recall that in my answer to a somewhat similar question he asked on 21 March 1985 I pointed out that helicopters normally take-off either from the active runway or a discrete helicopter take-off and landing area.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) These requirements are similar to those requirements for fixed wing aircraft to the extent that helicopters must air or ground taxi from the apron or parking area to these take-off areas in much the same manner as a fixed wing aircraft. This does not mean, however, that air taxiing helicopters are necessarily constrained to operate over aeroplane taxiways or taxi areas.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) The Australian requirements are, in general, consistent with the practices adopted by other countries for the ground movement and operation of helicopters at aerodromes. My Department is not aware of any country which adopts practices which are substantially different from those used in Australia.
      </para>
      <para>
       While it is obviously desirable to minimise the air taxiing of helicopters on aerodromes not only in the interests of expediency but also to restrict the effect of rotor downwash, it is clearly impracticable to avoid or prohibit such operations altogether. My Department is not aware of any country which has adopted such a prohibition.

       This is a vast improvement in the situation experienced under the Fraser Government when during the seven year period 1976 to 1982 the average annual working days lost in the maritime and stevedoring industries were 84.4. The yearly figures are shown in the table below. Clearly the Government's industrial relations policies, underpinned by the Accord, have had an enormous impact on improving Australia's economic and industrial relations climate, leading to the lowest level of overall industrial disputation in the past seventeen years.

       (1) Is he able to say whether the US Air Force announced in January 1981 that a series of comprehensive tests carried out over a 3 year period showed that a Canadian-developed explosion suppression system (EXPLOSAFE) for aircraft fuel tanks can effectively prevent explosion in the event of combat gunfire penetration or other ignition sources.

       (3) If no investigations have been carried out, will he instruct his Department to (a) obtain a copy of the report produced by the Airforce Wright Aeronautical Laboratories, Ohio (AFWAL-TR-80-2043) as a matter of urgency and (b) report whether the incorporation of the EXPLOSAFE system in Australian light aircraft could substantially reduce deaths in aircraft accidents.

       (4) Will he discuss with the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce the possibility of the manufacture in Australia of the aluminium foil which is the cornerstone of the EXPLOSAFE system, with a view to it being nominated as a product suitable for earning export revenue for Australia under the Offsets Program.

      <para>
       (1) Yes.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) and (3) (a) Detailed investigations into the suitability of the EXPLOSAFE system in Australian civil aircraft have not been carried out. However the Report AFWAL-TR-80-2043 has been studied by my Department. The Report shows that the performance of the EXPLOSAFE system is advantageous in the military context of suppressing explosion as a result of gunfire and other penetrating ignition sources.
      </para>
      <para>
       It does not address suitability with respect to the post crash fire, which more commonly arises from fuel tank rupture as a result of ground impact forces. In these circumstances the aluminium foil, which operates to suppress explosion by rapidly dispensing heat in the case of penetrating gunfire, would be of little benefit.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) (b) A study of the statistics of Australian light aeroplane accidents over the last 10 years indicates that the use of this or other crash resistant fuel systems would not have substantially reduced the number of deaths. The vast majority of fatalities in this area are associated with ground impact forces or are of such a scale that fuel tank inhibition would be of little benefit.
      </para>
      <para>
       In accidents where ground impact may be survivable, such as in low flying agricultural operations, fuel tank inhibitors would be of some value. I understand such systems are available commercially in some aircraft but it is not proposed to make these systems mandatory.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) My Department will continually review the question of flying safety in Australia and this will include the use of such systems as the EXPLOSAFE system. However, at this stage, it is doubtful that such a system is warranted in the civil field. In view of the potential relevance in the military field I propose to refer the matter to my colleague the Minister for Defence for consideration in that context and particularly with respect to its relevance for Australia under the Offsets Program.

      <para>
       (1) Yes. Grants are provided to organisations operating in the ACT under the Community Employment Program (CEP), the Community Youth Support Scheme (CYSS), the Community Youth Special Projects (CYSP), the Skills in Demand Program (SID), the Industry Training Services Program (ITS) and the Australian Traineeship System (ATS).

      </para>
      <para>
       CEP: an organisation's Certificate of Incorporation is sighted during the project application process.
      </para>
      <para>
       CYSS: incorporation has only been a condition of grant from 1 November 1985, and existing projects have been given until 31 October 1986 to comply. Proceedings for confirming compliance have not yet been developed.
      </para>
      <para>
       CYSP: one project is funded in the ACT. Its Memorandum and Articles of Association have been examined and indicate incorporation under Section 16 (3) of the Companies Act 1961 (NSW as amended), as a Company Limited by Guarantee and an Association Not for Gain. Its registration number is 140680 (NSW Corporate Affairs Commission).

       Grants provided under the following programs do not require registration under the ACT Associations Incorporation Ordinance 1953:

      <para>
       Searches are not carried out for any of the other above-mentioned programs.

      <para>
       The experience of the Headquarters of the 7th Military District in Darwin is that Land Councils and the Sacred Sites Authorities have gone out of their way to facilitate Defence entry.
      </para>
      <para>
       Administrative procedures are, however, time-consuming and experience has proved that eight weeks is the minimum time required for entry clearances.
      </para>
      <para>
       NORFORCE flexibility has been affected to some degree because vehicle numbers and the names of all personnel must be provided at the time that application is made for entry. Because of the nature of Army Reserve service it is not always possible to provide names of personnel at such long notice.
      </para>
      <para>
       While Defence entry has been refused by non- Aboriginal landowners, all requests for entry to Aboriginal land have been met within the administrative constraints that exist.

      <para>
       (1) My Department maintains a continuing awareness of and interest in the concerns of Aboriginal and Islander people. Their career opportunities have been increased by the following methods:
      </para>
      <para>
       (i) Creating Equal Employment Opportunity Programs especially for this group. These Programs aim to increase the number of Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders permanently employed at all levels throughout my Department.
      </para>
      <para>
       (ii) Encouraging general recruitment of this group as well as additional recruitment through the Public Service Board's Aboriginal Clerks and Clerical Assistants Program.
      </para>
      <para>
       (iii) Participating in the Public Service Board's Staff Sponsorship Program, e.g. two (2) Clerical Assistants from my Department have been sponsored by the Department to attend Tranby Aboriginal College, Sydney and have successfully completed a twelve (12) months Business Studies Course. One of these students is expected to return to the College in 1986 to attain qualifications necessary for entrance to tertiary institutions.
      </para>
      <para>
       (iv) Participating in the Training for Aboriginals Program (TAPS-was NESA) and Community Employment Program (CEP). Where possible TAPS participants are employed for at least twelve (12) months in order to gain worthwhile experience. At least three (3) of the trainees have completed apprenticeships and others have been employed permanently by my Department.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) (a) At 30 November 1985 my Department employed sixty eight (68) Aboriginal staff (including TAPS participants)-the majority being located in Canberra. This figure represents 1.7 per cent of my Department's workforce. It is above the target level of 1.1 per cent set by the Department of Aboriginal Affairs in May 1984 for the employment of Aboriginals in Commonwealth Departments and Authorities.
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) At 31 March 1983 my Department employed twenty three (23) Aboriginal staff. Most of these were located in Jervis Bay.

       Consideration of the establishment of an Australian Labour Office was deferred until the Government had received the report of the Kirby Inquiry into Labour Market Programs. That Report recommended the establishment of a new National Council for Training and Employment. However the public response to that Report, including by the National Labour Consultative Council, highlighted the need to investigate further the advisory and administrative structures relating to employment and training policy and programs. Accordingly I established a tripartite committee to further review these matters as a matter of urgency and its report will be considered shortly.

        —The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) Standard working hours of 363/4 hours per week apply to all the clerical administrative areas of employment under the Public Service Act.
      </para>
      <para>
       Other Commonwealth statutes and various awards of the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission provide for a range of standard hours between 363/4 and 40 hours per week. The areas of employment where standard hours are other than 363/4 are mainly confined to Australian Government manufacturing establishments and the provision of skilled trade and related services within Commonwealth employment.
      </para>
      <para>
       It is Government policy that the standard working week of employees on 40 hours be reduced to 38 hours. The Government requires such reductions in the standard working week to be negotiated in accordance with the Wage Fixing Principles of the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. Accordingly, Departments and other Commonwealth employing authorities must reach agreement with relevants unions to ensure that a 38 hour week is introduced with minimal cost through the application of agreed cost offsets. Such agreements are ratified by the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission prior to implementation. At the present time, only a very few areas still work a 40 hour week and negotiations are proceeding in all these areas.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) The working week of 363/4 hours for white collar employees has not changed since March 1983. Since that date, as stated above, a 38 hour week for other employees has been progressively introduced into Australian Government employment in accordance with Government policy. This is consistent with the introduction of a 38 hour working week as an Australian community standard.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) Systems of flexible working hours are available in all Australian Government Departments of State. Under the Public Service Board guidelines, shiftworkers and employees in those areas where 38 or 40 hours weeks are worked are not included in such schemes. As the application of flexible working hours, within the accepted Government guidelines, is the responsibility of individual authorities, no central register of authorities' systems is maintained.
      </para>
      <para>
       Authorities are encouraged to develop and introduce systems along equivalent lines to those in the Australian Public Service where such systems are consistent with their own management requirements and staff needs. It is understood that most Commonwealth authorities, covering the bulk of staff employed outside the Australian Public Service, make flextime available to their staff.

      <para>
       (1) Yes, there are four such programs. They are:
      </para>
      <para>
       the Industrial Democracy/Employee Participation Cost Subsidisation Program
      </para>
      <para>
       the Industrial Democracy/Employee Participation Research Grants Scheme

      <para>
       the Industrial Democracy/Employee Participation Resource Persons Development Program
      </para>
      <para>
       the Industrial Democracy/Employee Participation Advisors Scheme. (This Scheme will commence in February/March 1986).
      </para>
      <para>
       All of these programs have been developed in close consultation with the National Labour Consultative Council's Committee on Employee Participation.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) The services provided under each program reflect the aims of the particular program.
      </para>
      <para>
       Under the Cost Subsidisation Program, full or partial funding up to $50,000 is provided for consultancy fees, training expenses and other costs associated with approved projects which run over a twelve-month period.
      </para>
      <para>
       Under the Research Grants Scheme, total or partial funding up to $20,000 is provided for research studies which contribute to the solution of practical problems experienced in the implementation of participative practices.
      </para>
      <para>
       Under the Resource Person Development Program, the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology (RMIT) is funded to conduct semester length courses for people directly involved in planning or implementing various forms of employee participation or industrial democracy within organisations.
      </para>
      <para>
       Under the Advisor Scheme, a subsidy of $28,000 per year will be available over a three year period to assist selected employer and union bodies to employ an `advisor' to assist with employee participation/industrial democracy policy development and to provide advice and assistance to affiliates concerning employee participation or industrial democracy projects.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) Yes. An information kit on these programs has been made available to the honourable member. The kit provides full details of funding arrangements.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) Expenditure on these programs in 1985-86 will be:
      </para>
      <para>
       Cost Subsidisation Program-$750,000
      </para>
      <para>
       Research Grants Scheme-$200,000
      </para>
      <para>
       Resource Persons Development Program-$105,000
      </para>
      <para>
       Expenditure on the Advisors Scheme during 1985-86 is difficult to estimate, as the Scheme is still being established. However, expenditure is expected to be in the vicinity of $56,000 (calculated on the basis of the first two quarterly payments made for four advisors).
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) Yes.
      </para>
      <para>
       (6) Yes, unless a department comes into operation after the commencement of the section, in which case the department is required to submit an industrial democracy plan to the Public Service Board within 12 months of coming into existence.
      </para>
      <para>
       (7) Most of those departments and authorities which were required to submit industrial democracy plans to the Public Service Board by October 1985 did so. As at 15 November 1985 the following agencies had not submitted plans: Department of Transport, Australian Electoral Commission, Australian War Memorial, Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, Museum of Australia, National Crime Authority and Special Broadcasting Service. All of those agencies have indicated to the Board that progress is being made towards the completion of their plans.

      <para>
       (1) A major research project on the labour market situation of older persons undertaken by my Department's Bureau of Labour Market Research indicated that older unemployed people differ from other unemployed in having longer average duration of unemployment and in comprising a greater proportion of the hidden unemployed, i.e. having withdrawn involuntarily from the workforce or feeling discouraged from attempting to enter the workforce. (Bureau of Labour Market Research (BLMR): Retired, Unemployed or at Risk; Changes in the Australian Labour Market for Older Workers, AGPS, Canberra, 1983). Among factors responsible for this are older workers' concentration in areas of low growth, lower adaptability to technical change and lower geographic mobility.

        —The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) On 7 November 1985 I announced that the School of Army Health would transfer from Healesville into the buildings currently used by the Army's Officer Cadet School at Portsea after the Officer Cadet School moves to Canberra at the end of 1985. The School of Army Health relocation is scheduled for February-March 1986.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) The site and the buildings at Healesville will be declared surplus to Defence requirements and handed over to the Department of Local Government and Administrative Services for disposal.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) On current planning 24 Single and 28 Married Army personnel will be relocated to Portsea from Healesville.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) There are 22 civilian staff at Healesville. Four of the 22 are employed on a limited tenure basis as temporary employees and will cease their employment on completion of their period of tenure. Of the 18 civilian staff who will be affected by the relocation of the School of Army Health to Portsea 3 are single, 13 married and 2 have not identified their marital status.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) There are no other Defence establishments in the immediate Healesville area and consequently local re-employment is not available. However, those civilian staff with CE(RR) Act coverage who wish to be relocated with the School will be transferred to Portsea; those who decline transfer will be offered redeployment, initially within other areas of the Department, but failing that to positions with other Government Departments.
      </para>
      <para>
       (6) The decision to move the School of Army Health from Healesville to Portsea was taken primarily on the grounds of effective use of Defence resources and functional efficiency in Defence activities. While consideration was given to the consequences for the two communities involved, in circumstances of one or other of the Defence establishments having to close, there was no overriding community reason which could have affected a decision being made on the above grounds.
