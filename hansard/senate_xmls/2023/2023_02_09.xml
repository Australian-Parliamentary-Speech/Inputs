                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:02</span>):  I'm very pleased to rise today and introduce the debate on this private member's bill, fighting for Australia's coastlines. PEP-11, petroleum exploration permit 11, has become a bit of a political enigma—something unprecedented in our political discourse and history. There is only one fossil fuel project I can name that both the federal Labor and Liberal governments have publicly opposed, and strongly opposed: PEP-11, an oil and gas exploration project off the coast of New South Wales from Newcastle to Sydney.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why did our current Prime Minister, Anthony Albanese, in November 2021, as opposition leader and Prime Minister in waiting, so emphatically and clearly say: 'A Labor government that I lead will rule out PEP-11'? He stood with surfers, clubbies and the community, posing for photos with 'Stop PEP-11' T-shirts. In the lead-up to the last federal election, Anthony Albanese told voters: 'PEP-11 doesn't make sense from an economic, environmental or energy perspective,' and even reiterated to parliament that the project:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… should be consigned to the dustbin of history, where it belongs. … This is a complete no-brainer. … The minister should just do his job and say no to this proposal.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And then our Prime Minister at the time, Scott Morrison, stood with a number of federal election candidates on the beaches of Terrigal and also came out and strongly opposed the project. 'The project will not proceed on our watch,' the Prime Minister said, adding:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">From Newcastle through to Wollongong my Government has listened to the concerns of local … Members and candidates and their communities and we're putting our foot down.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">His candidates—all five federal election candidates—also commented. Mr Trent Zimmerman said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">There are few things more important than protecting our marine environment and this is why PEP-11 has engendered such a strong reaction from the community. It's the right call and I know will be a relief for those who have been campaigning so hard against …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Yes, they said these words, and the Greens completely agreed with them. Then, again, something unprecedented and extraordinary occurred, something never before seen in our political history: we discovered that our ex-PM assigned himself secret ministries and used these powers. As far as we're aware, it was the only time he used these powers to override his resources minister, Mr Keith Pitt, and he killed PEP-11—or so we thought. It was ironic, from my point of view and from the point of view of many other people, that the then Prime Minister used such a dodgy process to do the right thing by the planet, but there you have it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All this begs the question today: why did both our current Prime Minister and our former Prime Minister so eagerly oppose and kill PEP-11? Was it because they cared, as their candidates so openly said, about the risks that seismic testing and oil and gas drilling pose to our oceans, coastlines and communities? I'd like to believe that was the case; I really would. However, given the complete lack of concern shown towards other risky oil and gas exploration projects elsewhere around our nation, off our coastlines, I'm not so sure, and I will address that point again in a minute. So—you guessed it—it was most likely driven by political motives: not losing votes and seats, retaining power and winning government. That didn't work too well for the Liberal and National parties and most of the candidates who stood on the beach at Terrigal.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Underlying this strong political current is a simple fact: these risky projects, especially in a time of climate emergency, are deeply unpopular, and the opposition to more fossil fuel exploration off our coastlines is politically salient. That is the message that we need to listen to here. There is a reason our former Prime Minister went to such extraordinary lengths to kill this project and why our current Prime Minister was first out of the blocks to publicly and emphatically oppose an oil and gas drilling project off our coastlines.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At this point, it's important to congratulate the community and other stakeholders who campaigned so hard and so long to stop PEP-11, who brought this risky project to such political prominence, particularly Surfrider Foundation Australia, Save Our Coast, Surfers for Climate, the Wilderness Society and many, many others. I thank them for raising the profile of not just PEP-11 but oil and gas drilling off our coastlines right around this nation. Without them, this sorry saga would never have hit the media or landed here in Canberra on 'planet politics'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just a few weeks ago we found out that PEP-11, although buried, was not dead or cremated. It's back. Yesterday in the House of Representatives, our Prime Minister was asked by my excellent colleague Libby Watson-Brown to reaffirm his commitment to killing this project. He didn't. His response—patronising and arrogant, as was pretty obvious to me watching the video—to my colleague, that it's up to the law to decide, made a mockery of his strong opposition and election promise to kill this project. There were plenty of ifs and buts there, but, hey, that's not what he promised. Why did our Prime Minister make such a clear and strong pre-election statement if he was going to fall back on it being a matter of law and procedure that was out of his hands? Did he overstep in his assessment and is now walking this back? Did he mislead the Australian people and New South Wales communities? Was he naive or poorly briefed? Does he perhaps have it all in hand, but he just doesn't have the time or doesn't care enough to explain this to my colleague, the House, the communities he stood up for and the Australian people?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">None of these excuses are good enough. The community wants answers. Our advice is the Albanese government can make the decision to stop this project any time, legally. That's what the New South Wales Liberal government are publicly telegraphing, too, and, unlike our Prime Minister, they aren't faffing about; we've all noticed. Today the Greens want to make it clear and make it even easier for our Prime Minister and his government to stop PEP-11 once and for all. This bill, the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Amendment (Fight for Australia's Coastline) Bill 2022, if passed, will make this current proposal and any future PEP-11 proposal illegal in perpetuity. Even if we do stop this project, that doesn't mean in the future we couldn't have another proposal brought back. We've all noticed the ferocious appetite that oil and gas companies have for finding more of the product that, when we burn it, is killing our planet.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Given that both the Labor Party and the Liberal Party so publicly and emphatically opposed PEP-11, they should vote for this bill if, of course, they meant what they said. I'm not cynical enough after 11 years in this place to not be prepared to give you the benefit of the doubt—that you did mean what you said, as political parties, on those beaches in northern New South Wales, about protecting coastlines, beaches and communities from the risk of oil and gas exploration off our coasts. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And you would be happy, if you meant that, to apply this legislation to the precious marine habitats off the coast of King Island in Tasmania, off the Twelve Apostles or off the Otway Basin. The Schlumberger-TGS oil and gas exploration project plan for the Southern Ocean, for example, will be one of the biggest in our nation's history. They're about to go and blast 7.7 million hectares of ocean with seismic testing, hoping to find another North West Shelf sized gas deposit off the coastlines of Tasmania and Victoria, threatening southern right whales, blue whales and humpback whales, not to mention the commercial fisheries in and around that area, not only with the risk of oil spills but also with seismic testing, which this Senate has looked at in comprehensive detail, and all the risks it brings to marine habitats.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Already, fishers in Lakes Entrance in Victoria have suffered a reduction in whiting catches of 99 per cent after seismic testing. The same area reported a reduction in flathead catches of 71 per cent. Similarly, in Bass Strait, following a seismic survey in 2010, scallop fishers reported huge losses in catch, with the industry attributing a loss of 24,000 tonnes—worth $70 million to the Tasmanian fishing community—directly to the impact of seismic testing. This bill will stop that. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I ask again today: if it's good enough for New South Wales, surely it's complete hypocrisy to have double standards for other parts of our magnificent nation—Victoria, Tasmania, South Australia and Western Australia? If we meant what we said on those beaches in New South Wales, then we must understand that other communities around this country feel just as strongly about oil and gas projects off their coastlines.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To finish off, it's plain and simple insanity to keep exploring for the exact same product while knowing full well that, when we burn it, it is directly killing our oceans, as we have been lucky enough to know them in our lifetimes. It's got to stop. The science tells us clearly: we must leave all new fossil fuels in the ground and transition as rapidly as possible to clean energy. That's what the conservative International Energy Agency told us in 2022. That's the year that all new fossil fuel projects must stay in the ground, if we have any chance of meeting our warming targets of 1½ degrees. We know Australia's warmed 1½ degrees on pre-industrial levels. CSIRO told us that a few months ago. We're already seeing rapid massive changes in our ecosystems and habitats in our environment and extreme weather events. This is all happening already on a global temperature rise of around 1.2 degrees. Even 1.5 degrees is still a real problem, and we're well on track for much higher temperature rises around the world and nothing will suffer more than our oceans. It's got to stop.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill we have before us here today is a good start. In supporting this bill we will be fighting not just for our coastlines, marine environments and fishing communities but will be supporting communities right around this country to actually transition, show leadership and do what we need to do. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Trade and Assistant Minister for Manufacturing</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:16</span>):  The government, of course, doesn't support the bill that is currently before the chamber. I want to come to PEP-11 in a moment but the coverage of the bill is much broader than PEP-11. It would apply to petroleum exploration leases right across eastern and southern Australia. It would have a profound effect on our $90 billion oil and gas sector. The proposition that his government would support a blanket ban on oil and gas exploration and development is completely utterly unacceptable to the government. I want to make a few comments about why then I want to come to the issue of PEP-11. I respect the fact that Senator Whish-Wilson not only had a number of other particular potential developments in mind in his own contribution today but also other matters that he's brought to the Senate in relation to some of these developments.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We don't support a one-out approach of making special measures in Australia of knocking over fossil fuel development or oil and gas projects in Australia and that's because we support the global framework. That's because the position of the Australian government is that we, like the previous government and future governments, are signed up to the Paris framework. That means that we have to take measures for our own domestic emissions. Other countries, other companies, are responsible for the emissions that are created through their consumption of Australian oil and gas and coal and other products. It's an attractive slogan to put to people who are legitimately deeply concerned about the impact of dangerous climate change on our environment, on our welfare, on our security, on our safety. Its impact is felt very differently around the world. It's felt most dramatically in the Pacific and South-East Asia where efforts are focused on managing the impacts of changing temperatures, changing patterns and rising sea levels. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I spent some time last year in the Mekong Delta, where the impact of ever-rising sea levels in the flat, low delta is having a profound effect on food security, rural poverty and agricultural production. You could not have two more different looking river systems than the Murray-Darling and the Mekong. But 30 years of deep agricultural research between Vietnam and Australian industry and Australian government agencies shows our history of dealing with soil salinity in the Murray-Darling Basin means that there are very important research collaborations assisting their response. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is legitimate to argue that the scale of the global response is not sufficient to meet the challenge. If that's the case then that is an argument for more concerted global action. That is an argument for nations to comply with their obligations and argue for more—</span>

                    </a>  leadership, indeed, because that's been lacking for the last decade. You don't take one-off action that undermines the cause of collective global action. It's at best wrong-headed and, at worst, it distracts people into a cul-de-sac of action. A bit of free advice on the environmental approach here—and feel free to ignore it—what it means is that, if people are focused upon this idea that cancelling particular projects and undermining Australia's overall response and the level of community support across the community for cohesive, concerted government action and they think that's going to assist the cause of global emissions reduction, that is entirely wrong. It undermines community support. It's big in some suburbs, but it undermines community support for action that delivers reduced emissions, lower energy costs, investment in the technology of the future and, critically, global cooperation.</span>

                    </a>  I'm going to come to PEP-11 in a minute, don't you worry about that. In terms of the principle, in my view it is utterly wrong-headed to campaign on the basis of the climate response to particular projects in the way that Senator Whish-Wilson has described. I respect the fact that there are other reasons why local communities agitate on these issues, particularly in areas of deep environmental significance and areas where there are real environmental, biodiversity or other values—or economic values, indeed. I did hear Senator Whish-Wilson talk about there not being much flathead around in Tasmania. I can tell him that I am surprised and grateful that there were quite a few flathead around the South Coast of New South Wales over the course of January, and I caught some of them. Coming back to the debate, as a matter of principle, I think that's the wrong approach. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There should be an argument for broader global action—no quibbling with that—but countries of the world have to take action together. You can adopt that approach in the way that former prime minister Abbott did, which was an argument for no action, or you can say it's an argument for leadership. I can tell you, from the response of leaders around the world, Australia's return to a sensible, cohesive, active position in this debate is very welcome indeed. The last government and the two governments before that, the governments of Mr Turnbull and Mr Abbott, were pariahs in the international community on climate action. They isolated Australia in a way that didn't just damage our capacity to be effective on climate; it also damaged our economic interest. They damaged our position in the region and they damaged, as has become very clear, our reputation in the Indo-Pacific in particular.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On the PEP-11 project itself, I'm required to say that there's a process still before the courts. Even though we're in the parliament here, there's a requirement to be circumspect about some of the matters that are before the courts. The core of the problem is what the former prime minister did over the course of the last two years. I do think that the position of the Greens on these questions is—I say it respectfully—wrong-headed in terms of principle; but you've moved from wrong-headed to wrong—just wrong.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The idea that a prime minister would so pervert the processes of government that he swears himself in secretly to a range of portfolios and the only action undertaken—the only thing that, so far, we know that this bloke actually did, the former member for Cook—the member for Cook; he's not gone yet, not yet—was this stunt, and he didn't mean it. He didn't mean it! He perverted the processes of government in a way that he must have known was improper and that he must have known would lead to endless court action. He must have known that it was wrong and he took the action in a way which undermined the stated public policy objective.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If you were fair-dinkum serious as a government about achieving the public policy objective that he claimed, on the beach with the sand between his toes in Terrigal, he actually cared about—trying to sandbag those seats—he would have gone to the cabinet. He would have had the courage of what remained of his convictions and he would have done what a sensible, proper prime minister does—that is, have a discussion with cabinet, have the courage of your convictions, make a properly founded cabinet decision. Instead, it was an improper, shonky stunt. Where are we now? We're where we always ended up with Mr Morrison: an announcement, some crude politics that people saw straight through, but an utter disaster and a legacy of more delay and more uncertainty, with Mr Morrison's legacy left even further in tatters.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Until the senators opposite, and their colleagues in the Liberal and National parties, really come to grips with how much Mr Morrison actually perverted the processes of government and what that means for their legacy, they haven't got a hope. They haven't got a hope, because one of the things you have to do, if you're going to be a fair dinkum opposition instead of a pretend one, is you actually have to come to grips with the legacy of your own government. And it was crook. At the beating, desiccated heart of that miserable government lay a person who centralised the processes of government so much and hid it from his colleagues, who perverted the cabinet processes so much that the government was not functional. It was a government by fiat, and it was enabled by all of these people over here—all of them. It was enabled by the leader here, by senior cabinet ministers, by staffers, by ministers, by backbenchers. They all knew what was going on but never had the courage to stand up to the bloke and say, 'This has got to stop.' Until you come to grips with that, you're not going to be a fair dinkum opposition. If you can't come to grips with that legacy, you're not going to be able to be a fair dinkum opposition.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:31</span>):  I rise to oppose the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Amendment (Fight for Australia's Coastline) Bill 2022. I'm fascinated. I have just been listening to the contribution from Senator Ayres, which was all over the shop. I was hoping for a cohesive, logical debate about not supporting the bill, but instead he actually ended up supporting the bill by his comments. That's not very useful to me at all, but I guess you can expect nothing less of a very politicised government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My concern is that this legislation and the Greens party are hell-bent on destroying the resources sector, the same sector that has paid $37 billion in salaries to Australians in the last financial year, in 2022. The same sector that pays $43 billion in royalties and taxes that pay for schools and roads and hospitals right across this nation. The same sector that makes up 11 per cent of Australia's GDP.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia has a robust approvals process. We have some of the highest environmental standards in the world for our mining and resources industry, and the state and federal laws have been designed to ensure that due process is followed; that we have a logical and coherent set of steps that allow for approval applications, approvals, appeal processes. I would say it's almost too lengthy because we also have some of the longest approval processes in the world. But it does provide an equal and level playing field for all projects. The important thing to note is that if we start legislating for specific projects we undermine that level playing field.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Ayres made a comment around Australia's reputational risk. He was talking about a different topic, but I'm raising the reputational risk for investment in this country that comes from this kind of legislation. What we are saying to investors—and it doesn't matter if they're investing in coal or gas or critical minerals or renewable projects or agricultural projects—what we are saying to the rest of the world is that we would be a country that could not be relied on under its approvals process, that we are too risky for investment dollars. We rely on investment dollars. So this legislation is risking the very foundation that Australia is built on of taking capital, whether it be domestic or international, whether it be from institutions or mum-and-dad investors, that we are becoming unreliable as an investment destination.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On principle, we do not support using a blunt tool of legislative intervention to block a specific project. If this bill is allowed to proceed, it does set a dangerous precedent for parliamentary intervention on any project because we know, because the Greens have told us, that this will not be the last project.</span>

                    </a>  If this bill proceeds, it is guaranteed that the Greens will come back to introduce bills to block other resource projects and development, and then the next and then the next. I'm sure it's an unintended consequence from the Greens, but—a very predictable response to this sort of legislation—the Greens are advocating for higher energy prices and higher cost of living, forcing manufacturing and well-paid jobs offshore and eventually energy shortages and blackouts across the nation. We have to be clear: this is the inevitable result of this piece of legislation blocking this project and then every other project that comes behind it. It is dangerous for Australia's way of life. It is dangerous for the income streams that we have come to know and rely on, because it is those royalties and taxes of a very highly regulated sector that allows us to have a high standard of health care, a high standard of education and many other government projects right across the country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Proper process from government is what I'm advocating for. Project approvals must have a clear and transparent approval process, and, of course, we remain committed to an increased supply of gas, particularly as we are now in a current gas shortage crisis. The introduction of the price restrictions last year has already resulted in projects, whether they be import terminals or gas projects, not proceeding and investment uncertainty, and that is leading to gas shortages. The ACCC's most recent report has again indicated that, and respected commentators are making it very clear that we can expect gas shortages, energy shortages, later this year. This is incredibly serious.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Gas continues to remain a vital heating, energy and manufacturing resource for this country. These risks of gas shortages and blackouts increase across the east coast because of Labor's bad policies and rushed legislation. It is vital that we continue to develop supply to ensure that Australians can turn on the lights, power up the stove, heat their homes in winter. So further exploration is necessary to ensure long-term gas supply. However, the gas crisis is already on our doorstep and countless projects are now being torpedoed by Labor's destructive intervention and the government must do what they can to bring them back online.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We can see that the government has no interest in properly managing the gas and cost-of-living crisis facing Australians, and, through their policy decisions, we have seen approved and viable gas projects shelved or under review, further fuelling both the short-term and medium-term crisis. I'll name just a few. Senex's Atlas expansion in western Queensland is a proven gas field. It was forecast to supply 60 petajoules of gas to the domestic market, and it's on hold. An LNG terminal proposed for Port Kembla in New South Wales has also been put on hold. The Santos Narrabri project, which could supply half of New South Wales total gas supply, is also facing further challenges and delay. The Viva import terminal is at risk. The EPIK Newcastle import terminal has been shelved—a terminal capable of supplying 80 per cent of New South Wales gas demand.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm sure the Greens would love to introduce legislation to block all of these projects too. But these projects were critical to Australia's future gas security, particularly as the ACCC continues to forecast gas shortages across the east coast in 2023 and in future years. But the government's inability to work with industry to secure solutions is becoming more and more apparent. Rather than working to develop solutions that will benefit Australians, Labor and the Greens are content with ramming through destructive legislation, stifling debate, blaming others, but, most seriously, removing Australia's standing as an attractive investment house for important resources projects, which we have relied upon for generations to allow Australia to be the First World country that we are. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The transition that the government keeps talking about and that the Greens keep talking about is going to be some time in the future, and it is going to be without a bridge. We have no bridge to move from the current position to what the government has legislated for in 2030. What we have is a government that's ensuring that we're going to have shortages of gas, higher energy prices and power blackouts, and we know who we can thank for that. We can thank the Albanese Labor government—its sneaky deals, its rushed legislation and its lack of concern for planning for the future for Australians, Australians' jobs and Australians' way of life. </span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator DAVID POCOCK</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Australian Capital Territory</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:41</span>):  I rise to speak in support of the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Amendment (Fight for Australia's Coastline) Bill 2022, and I thank Senator Whish-Wilson for his leadership on this. I thank him for this opportunity to talk about what is such an important issue to Australians across the country. The IPCC and the International Energy Agency have been clear; the climate science is clear: we cannot afford any new fossil fuel projects. In this place and elsewhere, you'll hear that weaponised by the major parties, saying, 'If you say we shouldn't have any new fossil fuel projects, you are against fossil fuels; you want to take us back to the Stone Age.' That is not correct. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What Senator Whish-Wilson's bill, as I read it, is proposing is that, on PEP-11—where there is broad consensus from communities affected and from scientists and a very clear commitment at the election from the now Prime Minister that this will not go ahead—we should rule it out; we should stop this happening and we should stop digging, given we're in such a big hole when it comes to climate change. We shouldn't be exploring for new fossil fuel projects at the moment. We simply cannot afford to do that. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's clear that there is strong local opposition to this project. I listened to Senator Ayres describing this sort of approach, opposing individual projects, as wrongheaded. I would respectfully disagree and say that there are thousands of Australians across the country that, because of a failure by the major parties when it comes to a sensible, timely response to climate change, have been forced to take a project-by-project approach, trying to stop damaging projects that are going to damage the local area and community but then also contribute, as was pointed out, to the global climate crisis, where we desperately need leadership. We need Australia to step up and say, 'Okay, no new fossil fuel projects.' It's been a big part of our economy in the past, but resources can and will still be a big part of it in the future. We can move into critical minerals. We can start processing iron ore here. There is a really exciting future for our resources sector, but not if we see the kind of climate that we hear scientists predicting, where we will be facing a mounting and spiralling climate breakdown and the types of extreme weather events that we're already seeing in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This 'wrongheaded' approach has been taken by farmers who stood up against Whitehaven's Maules Creek coalmine in Leard State Forest, which went ahead—in a critically endangered ecosystem—and farmers who stood up against Shenhua's proposed coalmine on the Liverpool Plains, one of our best farming areas. Those farmers were successful. They stopped that, and they celebrated that victory. We have ongoing pushback against Santos's CSG project in the Pilliga. Farmers, First Nations people—Gamilaraay people—are pushing against this new fossil fuel development in the largest intact dry eucalypt forest in Australia. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2023, given what we know about climate change, given the summer that we've just gone through—I would hate to know how little time Minister Watt has had with his family, given it seems that he's just flying from one extreme weather event to the next, having to talk to communities who are being impacted by climate change. This is here now. And, if we're willing to listen to scientists, we know it's not getting any better. We have to take decisive action on this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We can't have our cake and eat it too when it comes to the climate crisis. We can't say, 'We've got adults back in charge'—as we've heard many times—'and we're going to deal with this crisis, but at the same time we're going to keep exploring for coal, oil and gas.' We've got Beetaloo, Browse and Scarborough coming online, we've got Narrabri which needs to be fast-tracked—we can't have it. Australians are saying, 'We want elected representatives to start dealing with this in a way that actually reflects the challenge that we face.' This is a huge, huge challenge. It's not going to be easy. We need politicians leading on this. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, I want to go back to how important it is that decisions that are made in this place are in the best interests of Australians. The former government argued against having a duty of care to young people. I, frankly, find that mind blowing. If we're not in this place to make decisions that are good for young Australians, that are good for future generations of Australians, what are we here for? Every morning we talk about thinking about future Australians and making decisions. New fossil fuel projects are not that. They are not that, and Australians expect more. We've heard about reputational risk. The biggest reputational risk we face as elected representatives is what we do on the climate and biodiversity crisis. There are many other challenges we face, and there is much attention being put on them, but future generations will judge us on our actions now. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have never known more about the challenge that we face. We are one of the last generations to be able to actually deal with it, to make the changes necessary, to show the leadership that is necessary on a global challenge. It's happened before, and we have an opportunity to do that today. I urge the new government to step up and show leadership on this. Leadership is following through on your promises. It's ensuring that you're actually looking after the people who elected you to represent them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Before the election, the now Prime Minister, talking about PEP-11, said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Absolutely, we will stop PEP-11 going ahead, full stop. Exclamation mark. No question. Not equivocal. No ifs, no buts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That was on the Central Coast. Here's a bill that will do that. Here's a bill that will respond to the millions of Australians who are concerned about climate change, the young people who are protesting and the young people who took the federal government to court, saying, 'You should be thinking about us when you make these sorts of laws'—the kind of bill that we're debating today. You can say to them: 'We hear you. You shouldn't have to protest. Politicians should be looking after your futures.' We have an opportunity today to do just that. I thank Senator Whish-Wilson for his leadership on this matter, and I will be supporting this bill.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:51</span>):  It's been very interesting to listen to the debate in this chamber this morning on the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Amendment (Fight for Australia's Coastline) Bill 2022. Just to be really clear, we will not be placing a blanket ban on oil and gas tomorrow morning. This is not a responsible way to govern. We have stepped out a whole range of things on where we're going, but placing a ban on oil and gas tomorrow morning is not the answer. The transition to more sustainable energy sources needs to be done carefully. It needs to be done in a balanced way. It needs to be done responsibly. I think the eight months of this Labor government has shown that we are making significant progress after 10 long years of irresponsible action.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Oil and gas are going to play a part in our future. Our transport system, turning on the lights, cooking your dinner and using the internet all require us to have a sensible approach to the issue of oil and gas in this country. We support the international frameworks. We've committed to global emissions reductions, and we are establishing a more credible place for Australia in the world. We've been made the laughing stock for many, many years, and we are now changing that. We are now making those changes to get this country on track.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The last 10 years of stagnation from the previous government have been planet-destroying at worst and irresponsible at best. We are changing that. We have made moves already in eight months, and we will continue to make those moves, but we will make them responsibly and we will make them in the context of the global actions that have been taken by our colleagues. We'll be doing it so that we can provide sustainability and confidence that what we do is clear and transparent and has a meaningful and sensible pathway.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At COP 15, for example, we led from the front. We campaigned for strong targets and clear measurements, and we now have a global agreement to protect 30 per cent of our land and 30 per cent of our oceans by 2030. We're not looking at that and saying, 'This is it; we can all go home to bed now.' It is about crafting a pathway forward. It is about genuinely making a difference. We have secured a high ambition on restoring degraded land, inland water and coastal marine ecosystems. We have good targets on reducing invasive species and recognising island sites. We've successfully advocated for placing rights and interests of First Nations people at the forefront of nature conservation, when they've been ignored for so long. Large companies will be required to disclose their nature related risks and impacts. They will be held to account. Australia has led the way on these negotiations, pushing for an ambitious agreement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But we are getting on with delivering the plans at home as well. Our 'protect and repair' program for the environment has been announced. The minister is taking serious action to ensure that we change the way that this country is dealing with those threats that we are all so clear about and that have been articulated in debates in this parliament. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are implementing a stronger emissions reduction target with a clear pathway to net zero. Rewiring the Nation for renewable energy will enable those renewable energy sources to tap straight into the grid, and we will have cheaper, cleaner power. Our environment protection agency is going to be able to enforce our laws on the ground. We have had more than a decade of challenges, more than a decade of knowing that our environmental laws are broken, but we are fixing that. As I said, in eight short months we are fixing the problems that this country has faced for the last decade and longer. We need to get to net zero. We need to protect the planet, we need to do it responsibly and we need to do it in a manner that provides clarity for business and clarity for people who care about the environment and people who don't. We need to provide that clarity so that everyone knows what this playing field will look like. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the last eight months we have changed that playing field. Conservation organisations have welcomed these changes, and business has welcomed these changes. These are changes that everyone can see need to be made. The opposition left animals, plants and places without the protection that they need and hid the contents of the State of the environment report—and no wonder. Two years out from an election, releasing that report would have shown that nothing had been done and the country's environment was in a dire state. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On our approach to coal and gas, we aim to get to 82 per cent renewable energy by 2030, and the detailed plans we have put in place will get us there. Our plans are clear and transparent and open for anyone to look at. New projects that do go forward will need to meet very specific requirements. They will need to meet rigorous environmental checks, which we are changing as I have set out. They will also need to comply with the safeguard mechanism reforms that we are currently consulting on. Our approach to reducing the emissions of our biggest emitters will be addressed through those planned reforms. All big emitters should reduce their emissions. The challenge we have in getting to net zero is a challenge for all of us. To be clear: the majority of businesses realise that this must be done so that their business can operate. This is not, as is claimed by some in this chamber, business-killing action—it isn't. It is about setting up Australia to operate effectively, efficiently, profitably into the future. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reforms of the safeguard have been designed so that all facilities, whether they are existing or new, are required to reduce their emissions. New coal and gas projects covered by the facilities will be required to keep their emissions below their baselines from their first year in operation and their baselines will reduce over time on that pathway, as I've said, to net zero by 2050. This recognises that new facilities can use the latest technology. This is not about stopping things; this is about learning how to do things differently. This is about embracing innovation. This is about changing the way we do things—not just stopping things but utilising the amazing science and development industries that we have, to change the way that we do things, to move ourselves into a state of renewable, sustainable energy, to power this country from the resources that are indeed renewable. We believe this sends a very strong signal to investors, because we need investment. We need investors to see that Australia is an excellent place to invest in—that we can see the future, that we have vision and leadership, and that our leadership says, 'We will embrace the future and we will do it cleanly,' not that we will stop doing everything that people don't like.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The previous government's design for emissions reduction was seriously flawed, and emissions actually increased over time. The detail is important, and the commitment of our industries and our communities is really important. We are getting there. We are consulting with people, and we are getting very positive responses. Even organisations that a couple of years ago would stand staunchly against making emissions reductions are now coming to the party, and that is because they know that their future relies on them getting on board, changing the technology that we're using, changing how business is operated and preparing ourselves to be a leader of the future. The projects will meet both of those—the emissions reduction piece and also the environmental piece.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senators may have noticed I haven't said 'PEP-11' yet. That is because looking at one single project does not give us the outcome that we need. Looking at one single project does not change the structure and shape of this country and how we approach energy into the future. The PEP-11 process is in front of the New South Wales court, which is its jurisdiction, where it is appropriately being dealt with. We will see how that plays out. My colleague Senator Ayres has stepped out the disaster of the past few years on PEP-11—the previous government, the politics, the grandstanding, the divisive actions, which all led to the mess that we see here today. Let's not forget that when the previous Prime Minister, the member for Cook, made his declarations, he wasn't just the Prime Minister; he was also the resources minister and held a bunch of other ministries as well, as we know from the mess that he created by feeling that he was the only one fit to run any of those portfolios, given his distrust of his colleagues. That creates huge challenges in our legal system and our parliamentary system. Secrecy and lies are not something that you will see from the Labor government. It is no surprise that we had come to expect this kind of action from the previous government and the previous Prime Minister—confusion, grandstanding and political pointscoring.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are committed to following due process, respecting our legal structures and respecting our parliamentary structures. That is what we will be doing as a government. The PEP-11 process is in the hands of the New South Wales government at this point in time. That is where it is supposed to be and that is where it will be dealt with in the first instance. As we have done in the eight months that we have been in government, we will provide reliable, transparent processes so that everybody is clear about the future and so that everybody is clear about what we are doing and how we are doing it. We will not follow the previous example of chaos and mismanagement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This debate has covered the issues of individualistic and systemic approaches. I think it's pretty clear from what I've said that the systemic approach is the one that will lead us into a clean and reliable future. The individualistic approach of just picking out your favourite projects, picking out the things you want to worry about on a particular day, is short-sighted.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Looking holistically at our oil, gas and renewable energy environment is leadership, not individual calls on individual projects that sit in another jurisdiction. Leadership requires responsibility. Banning oil and gas doesn't provide leadership, it doesn't provide responsibility and it doesn't provide certainty into the future. Yes, we are totally committed to net zero. Yes, we are totally committed to looking at a future that's cleaner, more sustainable, that people can rely on and understand exactly what's coming into the future. </span>

Most of these types of bills these days have, in parentheses, some misleading statement about the bill. This one is called, in mundane terms, the Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Amendment (Fight for Australia's Coastline) Bill 2022. That should be amended if we are to be truthful to the Australian people to say, 'higher petrol prices for all' bill because that's what this would lead to. I don't know about other Australians but I did a lot of driving over the summer. It is eye-watering every time you fill up your tank and look at how much the bill is going to be. I'm fortunate enough to be able to afford that but I cannot fathom how some struggling Australian families afford to just to fill up their car at the moment. It's costing more to fill up the car than it does to fill up your trolley at the grocery shop. It is an enormous bill going to hundreds and hundreds of dollars. It would be very rare you get to fill up the tank and don't have to put your pin in when you swipe your card because it's always going to be over the minimum threshold. It's very, very expensive.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">How are we going to bring down petrol prices? How are we going to bring down the cost of living for all Australians? This bill doesn't do it. It definitely will not do that. It will only put pressure on those petrol prices because it will tell us that we will produce less oil and gas. If you want to bring the price of something down, you have to supply more of it. We need more oil and gas exploration in this country to help bring down petrol prices for Australian families and also to help provide energy to the world, which is suffering under the jackboot of Russian authoritarianism at the moment.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens obviously have not got the memo that net zero is dead and the world is walking away from the commitments to restrict fossil fuel use and production, and it's doing so at a rapid rate. Just this week, the woke British oil and gas company BP has come out and backed away from its climate commitments. BP has been famous for progressively adopting over the last 10 years more and more stringent commitments to walk away from oil and gas. Indeed, a company that used to be known has British Petroleum has instead tried to get itself known as 'beyond petroleum' in recent years. This week BP actually came out and said, 'No, it's not 'beyond petroleum' anymore; it's 'back to petroleum'. They're going back to petroleum because, as the <span style="font-style:italic;">Financial Review</span> reports today in its headline, 'BP dials back climate pledge amid soaring oil profits'. The article goes on to say BP 'was revising its plan to lower emissions by more than 35 percent by the end of this decade. Its new target is a 20 to 30 percent cut'.' Twenty to 30 per cent is a very big range for BP; it gives them lots of flexibility. The article mentions that BP, over the past year, has made $39.8 billion of profit. Shell has made $41.6 billion of profit; Exxon Mobil has made US$55.7 billion profit; and Chevron, $35.7 billion in profit. I don't want to see those profits that high. That is bad for consumers, bad for the economy. Good luck for those companies; they made the investments. They would be laughing all the way the bank over their net zero commitments. They convinced the world not to approve competitors to the big oil companies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens have been the greatest enablers of oil and gas companies in history, because, by successfully shutting down alternative sources of competition to the incumbent operators, they have helped to boost their profits. But the way to get those profits down—do you know the way to get them down?—is not by taxing them and not by restricting oil and gas exploration permits, as this bill does. It's by allowing smaller oil and gas companies to get into offshore petroleum areas and compete with these companies. That's how to get the profits down. That's how to get the prices down for consumers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A lot of these companies—I've dealt with them a lot—are sometimes quite happy to, not publicly but behind the scenes, support bills like these. As I said, the Greens are the enablers of the incumbent large resource companies. These companies like to see some of these areas shut down because they don't want to see new, innovative and nimble smaller companies come in and compete with them to supply scarce resources like oil and gas. That particularly goes to areas like PEP-11, where a small company here is trying to get a start. It's not BP, it's not Mobil, it's not Chevron and it's not Shell. Those larger companies are quite happy to see the Greens do their dirty work by restricting competition in this space and therefore keeping their profits higher than they would otherwise be.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The <span style="font-style:italic;">Financial Review</span> article goes on to say that apparently BP is still committed to net zero. Yeah, right! I'll believe that when I see it. It's very easy to make commitments 27 years hence when, as we know, their 2030 target is now seven years hence and they've immediately dropped it. We'll see what BP does in 2043 on this matter. I imagine that, if they're still making $40 billion of profits a year, they will quickly revise their goals and objectives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other area that of course has got the memo on this is the European Union. They are at the forefront—on the front lines—of Russian aggression. They had naively and ignorantly become far too reliant on Russian oil and gas over the past decade, and the war in Ukraine has brought to a screaming halt the dreams and visions of green aligned parties right across Europe to deliver on net-zero emissions commitments. Over the past year, countries in the European Union have announced plans to build 18 new liquefied natural gas facilities. We have a kind of schizophrenia here, where we have some—</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will speak very briefly about what these amendments actually do. There are a couple of things I want to highlight. The most important is this need for a review to occur after a period of two years. That specific period of time is important, because it enables there to be enough of a duration of time to examine what changes will occur behaviourally, I suppose you could say, once the amendments come into effect, in relation to doctors and nurse practitioners: whether the effect is actually taking place and we're getting the desired outcome. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, the amendments ask for the review team to specifically examine whether or not the measures that are proposed for doctors and nurse practitioners should apply to other professions, which I think is important. We know that there are issues elsewhere across the employment world. There are shortages, in particular, in regional and remote areas. These amendments call for an examination of other health measures, particularly in mental health and the education sector. I commend the amendments to the Senate. </span>

It is important that government policy is subject to thorough review so that we can see what's working and what's not working. The amendments moved by the coalition bolster the review amendment made by Sophie Scamps MP in the lower house, and the review will encourage the government to consider whether student debt relief should be offered to students in other sectors of high skills need in rural, remote and very remote Australia, including in the health, mental health and education sectors.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Colleagues in here would be in no doubt that our position is that education should be universal and free, and that debts should be wiped off so students don't come out of higher education with massive debts. I do have to say this, though: it is a bit rich that the coalition—the party of job-ready graduates, the party of funding cuts and fee hikes and the party that has treated uni students and universities like ideological enemies for over 10 years—now wants the government to give greater consideration to student debt relief. But I guess change for good can happen at any time, even from those who have attacked the higher education sector so viciously over the last some years.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CANAVAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:24</span>):  Well, we're done. We're out of an agenda, and we're out of anything to do. It's only been about 260 days since the election, and the government has got nothing left in the tank. They're the 'Jacinda Ardern government' now—they've got nothing left in the tank.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I should explain to people listening, or in the gallery, that we're now back to what's called the Address-in-Reply. This is the debate about the address that was provided by the Governor-General back in July last year. So seven-odd months ago the Governor-General came here and outlined the government's agenda, and there's been a little bit of a debate afterwards from us about that speech that occurred. Normally we'll do a little bit of that in the two or three weeks after the new parliament opens, as the government gets—especially a new government—it's legislative agenda going. It's pretty rare for us to come back to it seven months later. You'd think there'd be other things going on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We can only hazard a guess here that the new Labor government doesn't think there is anything that needs fixing in our country right now, because it has no legislation before us. It has nothing for us to debate or talk about. We've got to go back to this time filler. This is like being at school: when the teacher runs out of things to do, she'll put on a documentary or something to bide time until the bell goes. That's what's happening here. We're filling time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're still getting paid by you guys up there; you're still paying us, but the government has nothing for us to do. I've got more bills than the government seems to have. I've got bills I've put in this week. I've got bills to end vaccine mandates, to give people their jobs back, ridiculous unscientific mandates that still exist. I've got a bill to legalise nuclear energy. Let's debate that. Let's bring that bill on and debate actually about how we can lower energy prices for Australians and guarantee manufacturing jobs. But, no, the government has no agenda. It must think there's nothing out there that needs to be fixed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't know what those in the government have been spending their summers doing. Over the summer I've been home. I've spent a lot of time in Central Queensland driving around the country to various things I needed to, and I've been speaking to people. There are a lot of people hurting right now. It's very, very tough. With interest rates surging, people's mortgage repayments have increased. For the average mortgage, we're looking at $1,000 more a month. Petrol prices are high. Grocery prices are continuing to increase and not slowing down. Today we learnt that box prices are going up, as well as cement, concrete. That's going to feed into construction costs for everything that's built in this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's really tough for people, so why don't we have some legislation here to debate to help people with the cost of living? Why don't we have bills here right now on, as I said, nuclear energy, to help power prices come down? Do something! Let's have a debate about that. Instead, we're filling time. The government is spinning wheels. It doesn't know what to do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think at the next sitting period this might be rectified. There are some bills before committees at the moment. The government has a bill to weaponise a thing called a safeguard mechanism. They're going to create a big new tax on the Australian people. So, as I said, I think the biggest issue for people right now is living costs. We need to help people survive day to day, keep them in their home, keep the banks at bay and away from knocking on the door. That's what we should be debating. Instead the government is going to bring forward, probably in the next sitting week, a bill to impose a huge new tax on Australians and the Australian economy. They want to make 215 businesses in Australia—some of the businesses that create the most jobs and wealth for our country. They want to create a tax, making these 215 businesses have to pay a multibillion-dollar bill to reduce their carbon emissions while the rest of the world builds coalmines, power stages and LNG terminals in Europe. We're going to make our businesses pay. Jobs will be lost, and, ultimately, Australian consumers will pay for those higher costs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of those 215 businesses, two of them are our last two oil refineries. I think we should try to keep our oil refineries in this country. In fact, the former coalition government helped keep them alive in the COVID crisis, which was almost existential for those oil refineries, but we helped them; we provided them support to keep the capacity here in Australia so we could continue to provide an essential product to Australian business and families.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Instead the new government has come in, and it's going to impose a tax on our last two oil refineries, the one in Lytton, east of Brisbane, and the other in Geelong. They're going to put a tax on those two refineries. That's going to flow through to your petrol prices. If you think they're already high, if you think they're high enough, the Labor government doesn't think they're high enough. The Labor government wants to put petrol prices higher through this big new tax.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This big new tax on the 215 businesses includes Qantas and Virgin. Qantas and Virgin are on the list of the 215 businesses. They're going to have to pay tax. For anyone who's had to fly recently, those prices are high. They certainly haven't come back to their pre-COVID levels. Prices are very high to fly around the country or the world. That's going to be higher because they'll have to pay this tax. What are Qantas and Virgin going to do? Of course they're going to pass that on to you—pass that on to consumers. That's going to make it even tougher for Australian families in this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The public transit authorities in New South Wales and Victoria are also on the list of those 215 businesses. They're on the list because the bus networks use diesel. There are some electric buses out there, but they still use a lot of diesel. And they're now in the gun of Labor's big new carbon tax. They're going to have to pay the tax. That means higher fares, on public transport as well, for Australian families.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I read today in the paper that New South Wales Labor's political director has had to give a speech to the Labor caucus this week. His name escapes me at the moment, but he has had to come in to the Labor caucus this week and remind Labor's members of parliament that what they should be focusing on is the cost of living. Why did they need that reminder? Wouldn't they be out there talking to people? Instead—</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator CANAVAN:</span>
                  </a>  Well, he's had to remind you, because all I've seen from this government over the last few months are things like the Voice and issues like climate change. They seem obsessed by absolute distractions that don't go to the realities that Australian families are facing right now. That's why you've had to have your director come in and remind you all: 'Hey, hey—maybe we should talk a little bit less about the Voice. Most people don't know what that is. Most people think it's a reality TV show. Talk a little bit less about that. Maybe we should talk about Australian families. Maybe we should talk a little bit less about our naive ambitions to somehow change the temperature of the globe and focus on how we can make families' budgets work.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Obviously, the government is not focused on that right now, given that they have not any piece of legislation here for us to debate. Not a single piece of legislation is live and active right now for these Australian families. As I say, I and other senators on the coalition side have bills ready to go. Let's bring those on so that we can do something for the Australian people and for our wages right now, rather than spin our wheels as the government is doing in the Senate at the moment.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator POLLEY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:31</span>):  On 21 May 2022 Australians voted for a better future: a future of reform to create a fairer Australia—an Australia which builds people up and supports families, and a stronger future for all Australians so they can get ahead and there are opportunities for all.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">However, before I talk more about Labor's plan for a better and fairer Australia and about what we have achieved thus far within the first nine months of government, I must speak about what should be unspeakable. The man who broke the Liberal Party's heart—the former Prime Minister, Scott Morrison—and those opposite should hang their heads in shame. The former government will be remembered for the lengths that they would go to to trash our institutions and conventions for their own selfish political ends and to try and trash our democracy and abuse relationships between the government of the day and the people of Australia, the Australian media and the Australian Public Service.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think Australians all breathed a sigh of relief on election night when the government was defeated. The former PM was effectively running a shadow government that his ministers and government MPs and senators did not know about, let alone the people of Australia. But some people, including those opposite, would have heard rumours. They would have known what was happening.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Morrison had turned into a national joke, and rightly so. He was a Prime Minister who couldn't keep his word, let alone a promise. Australia is a proud Liberal democracy which rightly upholds the highest standards of the Westminster tradition. Now, these principles and conventions were mercilessly ignored by Mr Morrison during his prime ministership. We've continued to witness more proof that Australia deserved so much more than Mr Morrison, in book after book since the time he was in office. While in office, he undermined our democracy, trashed the principles of responsible government, centralised power and knowingly concealed the truth from the media and the Australian people. This was a dark chapter in our country's history; there are no other words to describe it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now out of office, Mr Morrison is trying to spin his way out of decisions he made willingly. But history will not forget him. His recent performance at the Royal Commission into the Robodebt Scheme was ample evidence that this man should never have been trusted with the leadership of the Liberal Party, let alone with being Prime Minister of this country. If we as a country do not ensure open and transparent government and restore trust in our public institutions, the people of Australia will become even more disillusioned with our sacred democracy.</span>

                  </a>  Those people on the other side are laughing, but these are the same people that could have put the brakes on Scott Morrison. They could have spoken up, but what they did was allow the Prime Minister to continue on, to try to spin his way out of every issue and every resolution that he made to deceive the Australian people. Mr Morrison really did think—and, I'm sure, continues to think—that he can walk between rain drops. The legacy of the Morrison government will surely be represented by Mr Morrison's traits, and all the lies of the former Prime Minister told.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Morrison was a man with no leadership credentials, no principles and no integrity. The problem was that those on the other side never listened to the former minister for tourism when she sacked Scott Morrison because he failed in that responsibility. He was untrustworthy, and what she did was make sure that Tourism Australia was protected from a man who considered himself to be the marketing guru, a man who would never, ever apologise for any mistakes that he made, a man who would do anything for power and do anything to keep it.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's recount what happened during their term in government. Let's talk about the robodebt. Let's talk about those people who took their lives because of the coalition's policy action. Let's talk about the sports rorts. Let's talk about the community grants rorts and the car park rorts. It was a government that was a steward to the crisis in aged care and any meaningful action on climate change. The cost of living was left to fester, and many of those opposite just stood by and allowed that to happen. We know that Australian jobs went offshore. We know wages were left to stagnate. In many circles, dehumanising women and girls was a product of Mr Morrison's government. When Mr Morrison said he didn't hold a hose—I have to say that has been one of the most repeated comments that I have heard in relation to Mr Morrison. That's why he got defeated—because he would not take any responsibility. He was a bulldozer who would do whatever he had to do to stay prime minister and keep control of the Liberal Party.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I can assure you that an Albanese Labor government will never, ever undermine our democracy. We will try only to strengthen it. After a decade of incompetence, Labor has started to clean up the Liberals' and Nationals' mess. After almost a decade in office in my home state of Tasmania, we will be—and we already have demonstrated we are—better off with an Albanese Labor government. Tasmania will get a fair go once more. My community and I are looking forward to when the Albanese Labor government—as we have already committed in the October budget—will deliver on our election commitments in my state of Tasmania. Tasmania, we will deliver on them. These were commitments to create secure local jobs, to ease the cost of living, to create better health outcomes and access to palliative care, cheaper child care, better access to TAFE and training, better-quality aged care and disability care, and jobs in hydrogen and local manufacturing. And what did we have this week? Those in that other place, under Mr Dutton, have voted against bringing manufacturing back to this country. They voted against Australian jobs. That's who those people on the other side represent: the big end of town. They're not interested in moving the economy and growing the manufacturing industry. They learnt nothing at all during COVID and the crisis that we faced by not having the capacity to manufacture the things that keep our economy going because they allowed jobs to go offshore.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">From day one, the Albanese Labor government started the job of action and important reform. We have moved away from the wasteful 10 years in practice of the former government. We have ended policy paralysis in this country, and we will reform our country for the better, to create a better future for all Australians. There are significant issues facing our country, including addressing the cost of living, insecure employment and housing stress. What did they do for 10 years in housing? Why is homelessness one of the biggest social issues that we have been combating? We have been left with all the time bombs that those guys left behind. Why is it that the growing cohort of homeless in this country are women over 55? It's because, for 10 years, those guys did absolutely nothing. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are not ashamed of what we are doing and the social agenda that we're bringing to this parliament. We want Australians to be able to have access to GPs and good health care. We will always fight for more jobs in this country and bringing manufacturing back to Australian shores. The Albanese government is moving forward and we're doing what we can, as we do it methodically, putting pressure on the cost of living to make sure that Australians are supported during what is a global phenomenon after the COVID epidemic and also with what's happening in Ukraine.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those on the other side are very fond of trying to rewrite history when they come into this chamber, but the reality and the facts speak for themselves. We supported the Fair Work Commission's decision to raise the minimum wage by $40 a week. What did those opposite do when they were in government? Nothing. They allowed wages to stagnate. That's what they did, and they are sitting over there very proud of their record. They're proud of their record.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We supported a wage increase for aged-care workers. Aged-care workers were some of the most underresourced, underrespected, underpaid workers in this country. We've addressed that because those opposite failed when they were in government for 10 years to address that issue.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">What does the future hold and what have we achieved in our first nine months in office? In 2023, so many of our reforms will become reality. Cheaper medicines took effect on 1 January. Cheaper child care will benefit 1.2 million families from 1 July. There are 180,000 fee-free TAFE places. We know over the last decade not only at the federal government level but in my home state of Tasmania the Liberals have tried to defund and run TAFE into the ground. That's why we have a skills shortage in this country—because they don't want to support workers and they don't want to support training and skills and having jobs and manufacturing back in Australia.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Work will begin on new renewable energy projects that will create jobs, boost communities and make sure Australia has a secure, reliable energy supply. I am glad that there has been no interjections from my Liberal Senate colleagues, because they should know how important this is to their and my home state of Tasmania.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know there is more work to be done. We are staying focused on building an economy that works for people, not the other way around. Our new year's resolution is the same principle that has driven us since we were elected: don't waste one day; make the most of every day. We have achieved so much in nine months, including cheaper child care for millions of Australian families, cheaper medicines, an increase to the minimum wage, six months of paid parental leave, a policy for net zero by 2050 and paid domestic and family violence leave. These are critical issues to the Australian community. This is about the Australian people.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're delivering better protection for threatened species, flood relief and the Disaster Ready Fund. That's so important. We're having fires, we're having flood after flood, and they impact not only those individual families but the entire community. They need to be supported. That's what the Albanese government has done. That's why our flood relief and Disaster Ready Fund have been crucial. I'd like to here make comment and congratulate Minister Watt on his contribution since coming to government, which has been driving that relief. It's fantastic to actually have someone now in that area of responsibility that gets it. He gets it, and he's getting on with the job. He's not wasting one day.</span>

                  <a href="264449" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CHANDLER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:47</span>):  In rising today to speak on the Governor-General's address to this place nine months ago, I want to associate myself with the comments of Senator Canavan regarding how surprised I am for it to be Thursday of the first sitting week back of the year and for the government to have already run out of things to talk about. The reason that we have the address-in-reply is so that we always have something to come back and talk to when we don't have anything else to talk about—when we've run out of legislation. That's why we're on this debate today. It certainly seems fitting, because we know that this government is very big on rhetoric and very small on substance. That's why we are here on the third sitting day back of the year with nothing else to talk about—because they have apparently not got much on the agenda that they want to take through this place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But speaking of big on rhetoric and small on substance, it would be remiss of me to stand here and contribute to this debate today without making reference to my Tasmanian colleague Senator Polley's contribution, where she spent about 10 minutes obsessing about the previous government and only a small amount of her speech actually talking about what her government is seeking to deliver. I think it's all very symbolic and symptomatic of the fact that this government isn't delivering for Australians—that this government doesn't know how to deliver for Australians. The fact that they are obsessing about what happened in months past, rather than focusing on what they want to deliver for the future should be pretty disappointing to anybody listening in to this debate today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In compiling my remarks for this debate on the Governor-General's address today, it was interesting to look over the address, some months down the track, for what the government was indicating its priorities were back in July when the parliament first reconvened—to look at what those priorities were then and consider what the government has actually done in the intervening nine months. One of the main areas of focus for the government, according to the Governor-General's address, was the cost of living. This is certainly the top concern of many Australians, particularly in my home state of Tasmania. It seems like, every time you go to the supermarket, there's been another big price hike on a staple grocery item. The basic essentials such as fruit and vegetables, breakfast cereals and meat are all costing families more and eating into the family budgets, and of course we know that the electricity bills are forecast to continue rising dramatically.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are costs that families can't avoid. We can't live with the lights off. We can't not eat food. So it is absolutely appropriate that tackling the cost of living should be a top priority of this government, and I assumed that that was why it was mentioned in the Governor-General's address to this chamber, yet one of the first actions of this Labor government was to ditch its own promise to bring power bills down by $275. In the election campaign, Mr Albanese said that, under Labor's plan, electricity prices would fall from 2022 levels by $275 per household by 2025. $275 off your power bill is a very attractive proposition for many voters, who are dealing with tight household budgets and other rising costs. That promise to Australians to reduce their power prices by hundreds of dollars in this term of government would have been, I think, incredibly influential in assisting the Labor Party to win government. They mentioned this commitment something like 97 times during the election campaign, but, just a couple of weeks after the election, Labor ditched the $275 power price cut promise, and we haven't heard much about it since. It's very strange that a government supposedly devoted to reducing the cost of living—like I said, the Governor-General mentioned it in his address to this place—made its first move be walking away from a promise to the Australian people to reduce their power bills in this term of government. Since then, we have seen the government's own budget forecasting astronomical price increases for electricity. Of course, all of the price increases are occurring in circumstances where interest rates have risen month after month. Indeed, we had another interest rate rise this month, on Tuesday. Inflation remains high.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All these promises that we repeatedly heard from Labor in the election campaign—that your real wages would go up if you voted Labor—weren't true either. In opposition, Labor promised Australians that the cost of living would be lower if they were elected. In government, it's their job to deliver on that promise, not to walk away from it and claim that it's no longer possible. There are, of course, global events occurring all the time which increase cost-of-living pressures for Australians, I absolutely recognise that. Yet these pressures could not have been said to have been unknown or unforeseeable when Labor went around the country in March, April and May last year, promising that they would reduce the cost of living, promising 97 that they would reduce Australians' power bills by 200-odd dollars. It will not be acceptable to Australians for this government to make excuses and claim it is all beyond their control. Their promise to cut the cost of living was unambiguous and without caveat.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Governor's address outlined a range of serious and pressing challenges: the cost of living, as I've discussed; low wages growth; pressure in health and aged care; global tensions; and an economy in need of cheaper energy. The Governor's address said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is determined to tackle these challenges in a spirit of unity and togetherness—as well as urgency. It does not want to waste a single day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These were the words and the commitment of the government, and yet, nine months down the track, families around Australia are waking up. Families are bearing the brunt of skyrocketing cost of living, inflation, low wages growth and energy prices being out of control. The Prime Minister's office was busy planting stories with the media about how he was going to make a speech accusing Australians of starting a culture war. Is this really what your priorities are?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the reality of the Labor government that we have. They said they weren't going to waste a day tackling the cost of living, but in reality they aren't going to waste a day without spin and media tactics to try to distract attention away from the real problems facing Australians. Frankly, nothing better summed up what the government's real agenda was than the press conference that the Prime Minister held with an American basketballer six months ago. Was that what the government calls 'not wasting a day' in tackling the spirit of unity and togetherness: having a stunt media event with a basketball player to talk about a local issue?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was instructive in the Governor's address to look at the major issues for Australia which barely rated a mention. Responsible budget management is going to be the key to the future of Australia, but in that address we got little more than a few lines of rhetoric. So it was no surprise when the government's first budget kicked that can down the road on all of the difficult decisions that need to be made. Goodness me; I'm looking forward to what might be in the May budget, because maybe there will be some answers for the Australian people. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government said that it would be prioritising spending that achieves the greatest economic benefit in the most efficient way. That is a promise that we in the opposition will be scrutinising very closely when the government hands down its budgets and makes announcements in the future. It is a promise that will be put to the test in the upcoming budget in May. Given what we've already seen from the government, it will be no surprise at all to see that promise, like so many others, being broken.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another area which barely rated half a sentence in the address was cybersecurity. We have seen so much evidence over the last six months that many of the threats Australians are facing, and will continue to face, occur online in the cyber realm. Millions of Australians have been victims of major hacking and ransomware attacks. This is the domain of not only major international crime gangs but also foreign governments. We know the state-sponsored actors most active in cybercrime and malicious cyberactivity are also the states who are destabilising the international order in other ways—regimes like Russia, China, North Korea and Iran. We know for a fact that Australians and Australian organisations are being targeted by cyberactors affiliated with those states online. Just as we need to be able to defend ourselves in the physical world from nations which seek to use force to their advantage so too do we need to be able to defend ourselves in the cyberworld. Again, it was disappointing to not see that mentioned more in the Governor-General's address.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not just cyberwarfare and hacking that Australians need to be concerned about though. It is deeply disturbing to many of us in this parliament that foreign owned tech behemoths have so much influence over the minds, the welfare and the personal data of Australian children and teenagers. We are in an unfortunate period of history where we have allowed so much of our culture to be built around platforms which we know cause depression and anxiety in children and teenagers, particularly young girls. We know that these social platforms facilitate and transmit huge amounts of child sex abuse material. We know that they promote inappropriate sexualised content to young children and teenagers. We know that these platforms allow adults with evil intent to follow, monitor and make contact with children without parents having oversight of who is speaking to their children. All of this is happening openly; it's not a secret or a revelation. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At what point do we ask ourselves how this enormous amount of social harm is justified while these tech platforms continue to be celebrated and promoted? I believe that the welfare of our youngest generation is being severely put at risk by social media behemoths. Yet rather than demanding action on these issues of child abuse and harm, these platforms and governments seem more interested in censoring political discussion and debate. Many experts and I'm sure many of us here in this parliament are extremely concerned about the welfare of future generations, who, on the current trajectory, are going to be raised on a constant diet of social media fads, unrealistic and dangerous expectations, and sexualised content.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, as the shadow assistant minister for foreign affairs, I would like to briefly touch on the relevant portfolio elements of the Governor-General's address. In an increasingly insecure and unstable global environment our relationships with our neighbours and partners around the world are more important than ever. The Governor-General's address rightly highlighted the importance of the historic AUKUS agreement and the strengthening of our alliance with the United Kingdom and the United States. We look forward to the announcements of progress on AUKUS and our submarine capabilities, which we expect from the government very soon.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Governor-General's address referred accurately to an international environment far less certain than at any other time in recent memory. It's important that the government continues to keep the Australian public informed about and engaged with the reality of this situation. It is ultimately the Australian public who will pay hundreds of billions of dollars over the coming decades to defend our nation, and the public are entitled to be told why that expenditure and effort are essential.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is widely acknowledged by our allies and like-minded nations that Australia under the former government led the world in standing up to deliberate and sustained coercion by the Chinese Communist Party regime. I am proud to have been part of a government that achieved that aim, and I'm sure many of my colleagues are likewise proud. It is noteworthy that, despite Australia having led the world in this area, this new government has made a point of repeatedly criticising the efforts of the previous government in regard to China policy. A core part of the reason we led the world was that we were honest and we were upfront with the public about the level of coercion Australia was experiencing. We must not fall back into a pattern of being timid to publicly discuss this coercion and other egregious breaches of international order, including human rights violations. For some time now, the demand of the Chinese government has been that Australia rein in open discussion of our concerns, not just at a government level but also in the media and in the parliament. But Australia is an open democracy, and the government is accountable to the parliament and to the people. We are all entitled to openness and transparency. In fact, it is transparency itself which makes coercion by any foreign regime much harder to carry out.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="259819" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator GREEN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:00</span>):  I rise to make a contribution in response to the address by the Governor-General at the commencement of this 47th Parliament, and I'm really pleased to do so today. While it has been a little while now since His Excellency addressed this parliament, I'm grateful for the opportunity to reflect on those sentiments at the start of this parliamentary term. I have the benefit of six months of government, though, through which to reflect and remark on the address that was made. While I was updating my remarks before this sitting of parliament, it occurred to me how pleased I was to see how consistent the themes and aspirations of His Excellency's address were with the reality of what our government has already achieved in the past six months.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Governor-General spoke about our ambition for a future made in Australia, where we invest in Australian workers, skills, supply chains and sovereignty, through the National Reconstruction Fund. I'm pleased to say that this legislation has been introduced into parliament, and, despite what those opposite have said about their opposition, we are committed to bringing manufacturing back home. He spoke about the investment in Australia's infrastructure—something that has been a cornerstone of our first budget. Much of our government's work will be in not only restoring the reputation of our infrastructure department—ending the rorts and waste and the colour-coded spreadsheets—but ensuring that our regions have the investment that they need for the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Governor-General also spoke about our government's commitment to climate action. Although many things have differentiated us from the previous government, our ambition on climate action has been the most stark. That's because, like most Australians, we recognise both the urgency and the opportunity that comes with taking action on climate change. Last year, climate change and energy minister Chris Bowen made Australia's first annual statement on climate change. In it, he laid out the urgency of the action that is required. He said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Our country was devastated by the Black Summer bushfires just a few years ago.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">But, as frightening as that bushfire season was, the absence of action will see the temperatures and conditions of that year become normal by the 2040s and become a 'good year' by the 2060s.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government is prepared to act to stem the tide of that forecast. We are prepared to listen to the science, to implement change, to deliver policies that create good jobs and to listen to what the Australian people voted for.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm proud that one of our first actions in government was, with the support of many in this parliament, to pass the Climate Change Act. This legislation finally sets medium- and long-term emissions reduction targets. With the passage of this legislation in our first 100 days, we finally provided the certainty and stability to industry, to businesses and to the community that had been missing for almost a decade in government. It means business, industry and investors can plan for our future prosperity with a new level of certainty and confidence. We took a careful and collaborative approach to determining our target because that's the kind of government we are and that's the kind of economy we are striving to create. This certainty delivers massive opportunity for progress in our economy and for our nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our Powering Australia plan is already making headway on aligning our climate ambitions with our economic goals. Last week, Minister Bowen announced a global partnership for investment in green hydrogen with Germany and the Netherlands. These partnerships are just a drop in the ocean of work done by our government to re-engage internationally on climate. From COP27, the Quad and the G20 to our work with our Pacific family, we have resurrected Australia's international leadership on climate, one that was left for dead for over a decade.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On a community and household level, work has already begun on 400 community batteries, which are part of the Albanese Labor government's commitment to complement our climate ambitions with our cost-of-living commitments. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government is moving quickly to clean up the mess left by the previous government's failure to deliver an electric vehicle strategy. When we came to government last year, Australia's electric car sales were five times below the international average, at just two per cent of total sales. Our government has already passed on tax cuts to businesses who make the decision to invest in electric fleets. We have also partnered with the NRMA to develop our national electric vehicle charging network, making sure there's a fast-charger once every 150 kilometres on average on Australian highways. Of course, as a government asking the Australian people to walk with us on this economy-wide transformation, we are committed to demonstrating commitment and integrity of our own. We are working with all arms of government to meet our commitment of net zero by 2030.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also know that, in order to make good on our climate targets and Powering Australia, we need infrastructure to be fit for purpose. Our electricity system is one of the biggest emitters, and if we reach our climate ambition we need an electricity system to accommodate more renewables—from 30 to 82 per cent over the next eight years. That is a difficult target to meet when we have had 10 years of inaction under the previous government. Our Rewiring the Nation policy will ensure our transmission infrastructure is up to the task, with its investment costed in our first budget. All of this nation-building means good, meaningful jobs now and into the future. Through Powering Australia, our government is committed to creating 600,000 jobs, with five out of every six of those jobs being in the regions. Future generations will benefit from 10,000 new energy apprentices, and I look forward to seeing many of them in my backyard in regional Queensland.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a regional Queenslander I know how much anxiety and aspiration was built into debates about climate change and energy over the last decade. Hopefully, some of that divisiveness has now changed. We feel it a lot in regional Queensland. It's a daily discussion. But regional communities like mine have always been the centrepiece of Australia's energy security and industrial prosperity. Regional Australia worked hard for the good fortune that the entire nation enjoyed over decades. We have rightly earned our place as a centrepiece of its future opportunities. Regional Australia is at the core of our plan to become a renewable energy superpower. Our communities will be central to our efforts to rebuild our manufacturing industry, underpinned by reliable and affordable energy. Regional Australia will lead the innovation and effort to re-establish our global industrial leadership.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These commitments aren't just nice things to say, or untested aspirations. They are already underway. We have hit the ground running and we are committed to delivering on our promises. I know this firsthand because a few weeks ago I was in Townsville with the Prime Minister, and we announced that $150 million is already earmarked for a green hydrogen project in Townsville. It's why Gladstone was one of the first places listed as a future location for regional hydrogen hubs in last week's joint announcement with the Netherlands. Australia's regions are hives of resources, skills and expertise. There is no better example of that than throughout Central, North and Far North Queensland—communities who are so ready, have been waiting for leadership, finally have it and can't wait to get started.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is also fortunate to learn from the insights and expertise of First Nations communities on our natural environment. In my role as a senator for Queensland and Special Envoy for the Great Barrier Reef, I speak directly with First Nations rangers, community leaders and traditional owners. It is their intimate knowledge of our country and of our natural environment that will ensure the success of our collective efforts on climate. This is why our Labor government is proud to work directly with communities to develop our very first First Nations Clean Energy Strategy. It's why we're investing in the unique expertise and perspective of the Torres Strait, a beautiful part of Queensland, by developing the Torres Strait Climate Centre of Excellence. I'm lucky to have spent quite a bit of time in this place and to have seen firsthand the intimacy with which these communities understand the unique waterways on which they live. The water is a way of life in the Torres Strait. Working in respectful partnership with Torres Strait Islanders is one of our most promising strategies to protect the land and, most importantly, the water that we all love, especially the Great Barrier Reef.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm proud to have played my part in Australia's climate efforts in my role as Special Envoy for the Great Barrier Reef. Not only is the reef one of the seven wonders of the natural world; it is a vital part of Australia's economic prosperity. Sixty-four thousand jobs rely on the reef, and those families and businesses are front of mind in all the work I do. I only wish that those families, those businesses and those jobs were front and centre in the minds of those opposite. The Albanese Labor government has already invested $1.2 billion in protecting the Great Barrier Reef and making sure it can be enjoyed for generations to come.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When you consider the scale of communities and businesses and industries that are impacted by climate uncertainty, the inaction of the previous government becomes all the more shocking. That negligence is no better demonstrated than in our manufacturing industry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Manufacturers have been telling us for years that they need reliable, cheap energy to keep their doors open. With a sturdy climate ambition and clarity on safeguard mechanisms, our government is giving them exactly that. And it's paying dividends. Just recently, Minister Bowen opened the expanded facility at Tindo Solar. Their growth shows that we have always had the skills and expertise to make our future energy needs here but have just required the right economic conditions to make it happen. Certainty on energy, complemented by sound investment through our National Reconstruction Fund, means we are finally on the way to a future made in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While I know I've painted a picture of optimism and opportunity, there are some in this place who have spent their time in the 47th Parliament already trying to derail it. While there are some who'd let the perfect be the enemy of the good, there are those who don't even strive for good in the first place. The shameful record of those opposite on climate action didn't end on 29 May. Not even an election could change their minds. Not enough of those opposite did anything on climate for nine years. They followed it up by putting up every obstacle they could muster to stop us from doing anything in government. Well, it was not enough that voters had sent a clear message that they wanted to end the climate/culture wars; those opposite continued to roll out the same old boring scare tactics. It was not enough that they'd come into this place and repeatedly whipped up hysteria about renewable energy. They followed it by arguing for the most expensive and slow form of power and the one hardest to deliver to the market—nuclear power.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What I will give them, when it comes to their one-pronged energy plan, is that they will continue to be consistent with their conduct from their days in government. They'll propose something divisive, expensive and ineffective, provide no detail on where it will go or how it will work, and hope that everyone forgets the flop of the plan they were flogging for months before.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite will tell you that this challenge ahead of us is a zero sum game—that, if you make progress on climate, you'll lose something that you enjoy. That could not be further from the truth. We won't lose what we love about the weekend just because we can make it easier to buy an electric vehicle. Investment in renewables won't be the end of good, rewarding, renewable regional jobs. The opposition have tried for too long to pull the wool over our eyes when it comes to what we know we have to lose if we don't act on climate change. In fact, inaction, lack of investment and ignoring the challenges are what will cost us the most.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our silver lining is the duality of our future, if we get this right. Labor's future is for a serious climate agenda and a thriving regional industry; it's a safe planet, a healthy, vibrant reef and a booming tourism industry. It's electric vehicles and a weekend spent among our unique and pristine landscapes. It's renewable energy and affordable, reliable power at home. All of these things can be true at once, but only if we act with urgency. Australia has so much to gain—</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Australian Greens Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:16</span>):  The Australian Greens have an amendment to the report. Just for clarity, it's a revised amendment that has been circulated recently. For the benefit of the chamber, I'll just make it very clear that this is in relation to the Housing Australia Future Fund Bill 2023, the National Housing Supply and Affordability Council Bill 2023 and the Treasury Laws Amendment (Housing Measures No. 1) Bill 2023, which the report proposes be referred immediately to the Economics Legislation Committee for inquiry and report by 22 March. Our amendment is simply an amendment to the date: it's proposing to change the reporting date from 22 March until 22 April.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My understanding is that this is not going to be supported by government. I want to make the point here that this package of bills is the government's keystone response to a massive housing crisis that exists in this country. We have a situation in this country, particularly for renters, where if you're lucky enough to find a place to rent you are paying exorbitant rents. We have the Reserve Bank jacking up interest rates and smashing not only renters but mortgage holders. People are really doing it tough at the moment, and the government's response is a wholly inadequate response to the rental and housing crisis in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why the government wants a quick and dirty inquiry into its legislation, because it doesn't want the absolute inadequacy of their legislative response exposed. The Greens want a longer inquiry because we know there are significant improvements that could be made to the government's legislation. But the government, very instructively here today, is not going to support the Greens' call for a longer inquiry, and the reason they're not going to do that is because they know very well that their response to a massive housing crisis for renters and mortgage holders in this country is not going to be satisfactorily addressed by the bills that they're proposing and by the broader package of responses that the government is proposing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know these bills can be significantly improved. We want a proper inquiry so that we can hear from a range of people out in the sector—from people who are doing it tough in the rental market at the moment, so that we can hear from them about what they actually need from government to address this significant crisis in our community.</span>

The Labor Party placed its views on these matters on the public record 20 years ago. While the Greens may wish to engage in historic accounting, the more important foreign policy priority that this government faces is the fact we live in the most difficult strategic circumstances since World War II. The government is focused on utilising the means at our disposal through investing in our strategic and diplomatic capabilities to keep Australians safe. </span>

                    </a>  We'll be opposing this motion. We released the last BPORs after the last budget as a sign of transparency and accountability. That information was made public. What the Senate's now asking for is that we release our operational rules for how we're putting our budget together before our budget is put together. I am saying that is unreasonable. We did what the Senate asked last time and released them after the budget. I think that's fair and reasonable, but asking me to release the guidelines that we have in place whilst our budget is being put together is clearly asking for a document that's in the deliberation stages and subject to cabinet and ERC consideration.</span>

They would never have released anything to do with the budget, and now they've got a new standard: we have to do it before the budget is handed down. Please, Senate, be reasonable if we're trying to be more accountable and transparent.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">In particular, the Bill supports the implementation of a scheme for the mandatory reporting by hospitals of adverse events associated with medical devices. Following the 2017 Senate Inquiry into the <span style="font-style:italic;">Number of women in Australia who have had transvaginal mesh implants and related matters</span>, the Inquiry made a number of recommendations designed to improve patient safety and better ensure the early detection of safety signals. Recommendation 1 from the Inquiry noted the vital role of adverse event reporting in post market surveillance. The Bill introduces the legislative framework for a scheme involving the mandatory reporting of adverse events associated with medical devices by hospitals, reflecting that for many patients the hospital setting is where adverse events involving medical devices occur or are recognised. This measure supports the improved monitoring of safety concerns associated with medical devices through access to information held by hospitals that identifies serious adverse events, and facilitates the earlier detection of safety signals that may raise concerns about particular devices.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill encourages innovation and investment in biologicals in Australia by introducing a new dedicated pathway for marketing approval of biologicals that are for export only. This measure is designed to provide incentives for investment in the export of biologicals from Australia, and encourages development of this industry, by reducing regulatory burden and supporting sponsors of such products to obtain marketing approval. It would also ensure consistency across the regulatory schemes for medicines, medical devices, and biologicals.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill addresses and alleviates the effects of medicine shortages, by amending the Act to allow the Secretary of the Department of Health and Aged Care to approve the importation or supply of an unapproved medicine that could act as a substitute for medicine that was previously approved in Australia. This measure provides an important additional mechanism to help deal with critical medicine shortages, by allowing the importation or supply of an available overseas medicine that could act as a substitute for a medicine that was approved in Australia, but has since been cancelled or suspended. In some cases, this may be the only option to deal with a medicine shortage. Before exercising such a power, the Secretary would consider the suitability of granting such an approval, including whether it is in the interest of public health.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill supports the safe use of therapeutic goods by strengthening monitoring and compliance activities through a number of measures. The Bill removes review rights for decisions to require the production of information/documents which are critical in identifying and investigating potential contraventions of the Act, detecting safety concerns, and potentially preventing adverse events, associated with therapeutic goods. This measure is designed to prevent avenues of review for such decisions being misused to impede and delay timely regulatory action to protect Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill introduces a general information gathering power to enable the Secretary to request information from any person who may hold information relevant to a potential contravention of the Act. This may include, for example, a financial institution which may hold records of transactions, contractors involved in the supply chain or persons who are involved with the supply of illegal therapeutic goods. This general information gathering power is designed to support the comprehensive and timely investigation of possible contraventions of the Act and enhance the protection of Australian consumers from poor quality, and potentially unsafe, therapeutic goods through access to relevant documentation about potential contraventions of the Act. The Bill also extends the timeframe for holding seized goods to 120 days, to provide a more appropriate timeframe for seized goods to be laboratory tested, analytically assessed and carefully examined, and for regulatory or compliance action to be instituted where appropriate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill makes a couple of changes to the regulation of advertising of therapeutic goods. First, the Bill provides that the advertising requirements do not apply to an updated list of persons, including certain health professionals (such as oral health therapists), persons purchasing therapeutic goods on behalf of registered charities or governments, or to purchasing officers or practice managers of healthcare practices. Second, the Bill provides a mechanism for an approval of a restricted representation to be withdrawn where additional information about the efficacy of therapeutic goods becomes available. This ensures that therapeutic goods advertising only contains correct and accurate information, taking into account all relevant information known about the goods, and therefore reducing the risk of unsafe use by consumers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill contains a measure to support compliance by enabling the Secretary, on the Secretary's own initiative, to extend the due date for payment of an infringement notice, supporting the early resolution of a contravention of the Act where a person intends to pay the infringement notice, but does not do so before the expiry date. In so doing, this measure will support the early resolution of contraventions of the Act by infringement notice rather than criminal or civil court proceedings.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill also makes a number of other amendments to improve the clarity and consistency of regulatory requirements, codify current practices, and make other more minor changes to remove redundant provisions and correct typographical errors. In particular, this includes amendments to:</span>

But there's one area where we'd seek to have some clarification from the government. The terms of reference permit the committee to appointment subcommittees to determine any aspect of the committee's jurisdiction. That's a fairly standard provision in committees, particularly joint committees that are established, and it allows the work of the committee to continue with smaller quorums—a quorum of two, for example, with a subcommittee. The concern that the Greens have, and which has been discussed with other parties in the chamber, is that it includes with this NACC oversight community the ability to establish a subcommittee to do some of the statutory functions of the NACC oversight committee. The function that gives us the greatest concern is the statutory power and function to concur with or to reject the proposed commissioners, deputy commissioners and inspectors of the committee.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Madam Acting Deputy President, you will recall there was much discussion in the course of the NACC debate about whether or not a non-government majority should have a say, and a determinative say, in agreeing or disagreeing with the government's nominee for the Commissioner of the NACC.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We eventually resolved that and supported the bill in its current form. But that was in circumstances where we had clear statements from government that the appointment of the NACC commissioner would be engaged in a good-faith process and that there would be the active seeking of consensus amongst the committee for the appointment of the NACC commissioner, deputy commissioners and the like. Unfortunately, the terms of reference, plainly read, permit that that function of the committee, for concurrence or otherwise with the government's proposed appointed commissioner, allows that concurrence to be delegated to a subcommittee of just three members. Therefore, that would remove the need for the political consensus amongst the committee that the government said—and I accept their good faith position—was implicit in their model for the oversight committee.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a number of ways this could have been resolved. One obvious way, of course, would have been to amend the terms of reference to expressly exclude that statutory function from the powers delegable to a subcommittee. This can probably be clarified by a brief statement from the government indicating they have no intention to do that and that it will be a function for the whole committee, and I look forward to hearing the minister's position on this.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">In the 2022 World Intellectual Property Organisation's Global Innovation Index, Australia was ranked 5th in the world for our human capital and research.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">It means that we get a bigger dividend on our investment in research in this country. New technologies developed in Australia improve our production processes, reduce costs, create innovative new products and lead to greater diversity in our exports.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Distinct from other funding models in research, the AEA will have a "fast-fail" focus. It will fill a gap in the current research commercialisation landscape by funding translational research from early-stage research into a product that shows viability for industry partnership and investment.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for </span><span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and Minister for Emergency Management</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:14</span>):  I refer to the notice of motion from Senator McKenzie, agreed by the Senate on 26 October 2022, for the order for the production of documents, order 55. The senator's request relates to correspondence between the Commonwealth and state and territory governments. The government claims public interest immunity over documents relating to the senator's request on the ground that disclosure of such documents would cause prejudice to the relations between the Commonwealth and the states. Specifically, disclosure would harm the Commonwealth's ongoing relationship with the state government on this and future infrastructure funding arrangements.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I might just say in anticipation of Senator McKenzie's response, given her responses over the last couple of days to similar matters, that the approach the government is taking on this matter is no different to the approach taken by the former government when these sorts of circumstances arose. I think it is highly ironic that Senator McKenzie, of all people, should be talking about transparency of funding.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I rise, once again, to take note of the minister's pathetic response to a request from the Senate—not from the opposition, not from me as a shadow minister, but from the Senate, this chamber. Senators of a variety of political persuasions joined together to say they wanted to understand the decisions of the federal budget, the arrangements that the Commonwealth has with various state and territory governments around infrastructure funding and the cuts and delays that have typified the infrastructure funding in the latest budget. All the Senate was asking was for the government to give us the details. That's what this chamber is all about. It is actually about holding the executive government to account. That is all we were seeking to do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Once again, the Labor Party has taken the lazy approach to accountability and transparency and has popped in and said, 'Yes, we know the Senate has ordered us to do this, but it would damage and prejudice relations with state and territory governments.' What I find incredible is that one of the promises that the now government made prior to the election was that the relationships with states and territories would be better with them. Let's face it: they're all Labor governments. They're all in the same tent. The argument they put was they would be able to get along better with state and territory governments. Now they stand here saying that they can't even release the details of correspondence about billions of dollars of Commonwealth taxpayer funds for infrastructure projects with the states and territories because it would prejudice those relationships. If Albanese and Palaszczuk's relationship is going to be prejudiced by fessing up to the cuts, delays and agreements they've made on projects in Queensland then we're all in trouble.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Is the relationship of Premier McGowan, the Labor Premier in WA, with Labor Prime Minister Albanese going to be prejudiced because they are going to suddenly admit to things that are on the public record in terms of cuts and delays in West Australian infrastructure funding? Premier Malinauskas is another Labor premier. I very much doubt being open and releasing the correspondence between the South Australian Labor government and the federal Labor government around the cuts and delays to South Australian infrastructure programs that are all on the public record thanks to the budget will prejudice that relationship. If so, I think we've got a few problems. Similarly, Daniel Andrews is the newly elected Labor premier in my home state of Victoria. Would the relationship with the Labor Albanese government be prejudiced if they fessed up and said, 'We did agree to give you $2.2 billion with no oversight and no Infrastructure Australia examination of the veracity of the suburban rail loop, and we will cut those projects and programs that support rural and regional communities and the communities of Lilydale, Narre Warren and Berwick'? I was on the ground with Aaron Violi and Jason Woods only the other week, looking at the cuts that have been agreed between the Victorian state Labor government and the Commonwealth Labor government to critical projects on the ground in suburbs and regions in my home state.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a complete disrespect of the Senate and of accountability and transparency that this government said they would bring. It's absolutely appalling, but it's not surprising. On 26 October last year, the Senate required that the Minister representing the Prime Minister and the Minister representing the Minister for Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development and Local Government table the correspondence between the Prime Minister and the minister to any premier, chief minister, Treasurer or minister of a state regarding requests for, or approval of, Australian government funding for projects or programs in their October budget.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Assistant Minister to the Prime Minister, Patrick Gorman, made a claim of public interest immunity on the basis that further disclosure of the information would harm the ongoing relationship between the Commonwealth and the state government. And then, on 23 November, the Senate said: 'You know what, Assistant Minister to the Prime Minister? That's not good enough. We do not accept that public interest immunity claim.' Then Catherine King, the infrastructure minister, on 28 November last year, maintained the same public interest immunity that had been rejected by the Senate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The thing is, when you make these public interest immunity claims around prejudicing the relationship between the Commonwealth and a state or territory, you've actually got to check with the states and territories if they have a problem with it. You can't speak for states and territories and assume that they agree with you. You will find that out soon enough, as government. You cannot assume that you have their approval or their disapproval. I would be asking the Prime Minister, the minister responsible, to come back to the Senate and put before us the fact that they have actually written to these chief ministers to ask if they mind.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're talking about projects in the budget that are public. What have you got to hide? The amount of money, the projects that are being approved, the ones that have been cut and the ones have been delayed—that's all public. It had to have been agreed with state and territory first ministers because they're the ones that build the projects. They're the ones who are actually in charge of how those billions of dollars are being spent in their jurisdictions. So it begs the question: What have you got to hide, Labor?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've just sat through the formal motion section of our agenda and seen the Greens, the crossbench, the National Party and the Liberal Party all sit and vote for openness and transparency about the tabling of documents relating to key government decisions. And Minister Watt comes in here and critiques the opposition for this, for our voting record. Well, I tell you what, it wasn't much different to our voting record when we were in government. We backed the OPD claims when we were in government, against our own government ministers. I'd like to see the same level of commitment to integrity, transparency, accountability and the role of the Senate from this executive. But it's all a bit Labor, isn't it—the culture, the little hush-hush, backroom deals: nothing to see here.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When he made his public interest immunity claim, the minister also referred to when they were in government and to tactics used by previous governments. You know what the Labor Party said about any set tactics? They told us all how it'd be so much different under them and that governments should be providing the documents, that ministers can actually take it on notice and that the role of the Senate should be respected. Senator Gallagher, on 26 February 2020, said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This chamber has significant powers available to it to hold government to account, but, in order to do that, all non-government senators have to stand together and work together.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It happened today, and I look forward to those documents arriving from the relevant minister in response to Senator Hanson-Young's OPD request. Senator Gallagher then said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This disregard for the Senate that is being perpetrated, I think quite knowingly, by this government must be responded to.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You have to be gobsmacked at the level of hypocrisy. Not only is this government backflipping on 'yes' and 'no' pamphlets for the referendum and backflipping on diesel fuel rebates they are completely turning themselves 180 degrees on what they said they would do when they were in opposition, and it is very, very concerning.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <span style="font-style:italic;">
                    </span>The problem for the minister and the executive in the government is that their own secretary, in Senate estimates, talked about the letters between state first ministers and the Commonwealth, around the funding cuts and delays and agreements on infrastructure projects, and he admitted that he wanted to put them up on the department website once he received them. If the secretary doesn't think there's anything to hide, I don't know why the minister does. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired) </span></span>

                    </a>  What is fascinating is that the minister spent 55 seconds—not even a minute—avoiding scrutiny. I would not want to breach standing orders by pointing out the correlation between the minister's departure from this particular chamber and its resemblance to a rodent escalating up a drainpipe, because that would be against standing orders, and I have not done that. </span>

                    </a>  I made the point that I was not alluding to that. What is interesting is that we have a Labor Party who, before the election, did this great 'conga line dance', to quote one of their former leaders, around Australia, talking about the importance of transparency and accountability. But since the election—similar to their promise about reducing power bills by $275, by the way—they have not mentioned transparency or accountability. Indeed, it's like this negative black hole, where certain words go into the Labor Party lexicon and then disappear. It's like a negative dictionary—the words aren't in the dictionary; there's just a white space there. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a Labor Party in power who, before the election, said, 'Yes, we want increased transparency and accountability.' When they get into power, they sniff those leather chairs of power and they allude to the pheromones that are floating around the place and they decide, 'This is brilliant. We can avoid any scrutiny. We've got billions of dollars of taxpayers' money—not tens of thousands or tens of millions or hundreds of millions; we've got billions and billions of dollars. We're going to use it as our slush fund and we're going to go around Australia and—guess what?—we're not going to be accountable for it.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When this chamber, this house of review, tries to—not tries to but does—pass resolutions and says to the executive of this country, 'We want some accountability, we want to know how and where and why this money's being spent, and we want these documents,' what does the Labor Party—the giant 'light on the hill' that talks about accountability—do? It's not a light on a hill. It's a bonfire of accountability. It's a bonfire of transparency. This so-called accountable government is anything but. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we've seen this week is the Senate at its best. We've had everybody from the Greens to the coalition to other crossbench members come together to say to the executive: 'We want to know something that's going on here. We're elected. We're elected by the people of Australia. So, you people, you ministers, deliver on your promises. Show some accountability.' This is what this chamber has done not just this week but in previous weeks.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we've seen since the election is the Labor Party government become a closed shop on accountability and transparency. That is shameful, it is hypocritical and it is disappointing. It is so disappointing that the Labor Party would not only treat this chamber with such disrespect but also treat the taxpayers of Australia with such disrespect. What we are talking about here is the expenditure of public funds, and when we talk about public funds, we're talking about money that comes from taxpayers. I know there are some in this chamber, particularly those on the left side of the economic pendulum, who believe there are things called magic money trees, that money comes out of a cash machine which little pixies fill up each day, but it comes from taxpayers. It comes from people who work, who start and run businesses, who employ people. It comes from people who want to go and work for people who run businesses. It comes from the workers of Australia. But, no, we don't want any accountability there! Nah. Because this is now one giant slush being run by the Labor Party.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is so embarrassing when the ministers come in here—poor Minister Watt who spent so much time before the election attacking the previous government—and spend less than a minute, such is the disrespect that the Labor Party holds for this chamber and for the resolutions passed by this chamber. We've got 'minute man minister': 55 seconds. How shameful is that? It's so shameful, disrespecting the taxpayers of Australia, disrespecting the resolutions of this chamber, disrespecting the role of this chamber, disrespecting what we're here for. We're all here for what is good for Australia, what is good to make Australia a better place, and part of making Australia a better place is to ensure that public funds are appropriately spent and to ensure that the executive is held to account.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we've seen since the election is this chamber pass what are called, for those who might be listening at home, orders for the production of documents, OPDs. And what we've seen is order after order get passed by this chamber, but, sadly, day after day, hour after hour, the Labor government fails to comply with those orders, fails to supply those documents, fails to uphold standards of accountability and transparency. That is tragic.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The arrogance of this government, who comes into this chamber and treats it with such disrespect, is a damning indictment of a government that, at its first-year mark, at the 365-day mark, will spend 55 seconds saying to this chamber: 'You are not important to us. The resolutions of this chamber are not important to us.' That is wrong. That is wrong because it sets the standards for what this government will fail to achieve over the coming years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We'll see what happens in estimates next week. We're sure that in estimates next week we'll have the great and the good representing the Labor Party, sitting at the ministerial table—great ministers like Assistant Minister Brown over there, who I hope will go beyond the very low standards set by some of her colleagues and answer questions and provide documents. This is above party politics. This is above the yah-boo politics that you do sometimes see in this chamber, which is part of a vibrant democracy. This, at it's very, very core, is about this chamber living up to its promise as a chamber of review—a chamber that can hold the executive to account—because that is what this chamber does, and, when it does it, that is when this chamber is at its best.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly, the other side of that coin is that we've got a government at its worst, a government that will not provide the documents that this chamber has ordered. It's not just a polite request; it actually is an order of the chamber, by the way. The Prime Minister talks about good manners. Well, Prime Minister, good manners would start with you instructing your ministers to comply with orders of this chamber. The Prime Minister says, 'We want a nicer, kinder type of politics.' Well, comply with the orders of this chamber.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Instead, the Labor Party ministers snub their noses at this chamber. They snub their noses at the people of Australia; they snub their noses at the taxpayers of Australia. They snub their noses at what this chamber does. It is a shameful indictment of the modern Labor Party and of how they treat the government of Australia as nothing but a plaything for them and their union mates and they ensure that what they get up to is done in the deep, dark, secret corners. No! Be accountable, be transparent and be the promise that you said you would be. Do what you said you would do. But, no, you're not. You're just not very good. Actually, you're beyond 'not very good'; you're rubbish! Be better! <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SCARR</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:36</span>):  It is always a privilege and a deep honour to follow my good friend Senator McGrath, from the wonderful state of Queensland. I'd like to associate myself with all of the remarks that Senator McGrath made during his contribution in this debate, including his reference to various types of marsupials—or animals—and plumbing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What people, and members of the gallery, need to understand in relation to this debate is that what we're talking about here is that a majority in this chamber—and the coalition can't achieve a majority in this chamber in its own right, but the coalition, in addition to crossbench senators, Independents and the Greens—passed a resolution requiring the government to produce documents. So a majority of this chamber, across all of the parties and Independents who aren't in government, supported a motion that the government produce documents to this chamber.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Everyone sitting in this chamber has an obligation to discharge our duties to each of our states as a house of review, and we wanted to see the correspondence in relation to major infrastructure projects in the budget—the correspondence between the federal government and each of the states. That's the background to this debate, and, in order to discharge our duty as a house of review—a check on the power of the executive—we need access to those documents. And a majority of senators determined that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A 55-second response is all we got in terms of a response to the majority of the senators in this chamber requesting those documents. The 55-second response was: 'No, because it might damage relationships between the federal government and the state government.' Well, let's look at that. If you're going to use that as a reason, I say that, at the very least, you've got to pick up this thing called a phone, ring the state governments and ask them if they have an objection. You do your best to fulfil the request of the Senate, so the first thing you do is pick up one of these things called a phone and actually ask, 'Do you have any objection if we provide these documents?' Then, if the relevant state government objects, come back to this chamber and tell us. Tell us whether or not each of the state governments rejected that request. Then each of those state governments has to be responsible to their constituents and explain why they rejected that request. That's how the system should work. But there's no transparency in relation to either (a) the documents, because the government refuse to provide them, or (b) the process. What was the process? Maybe you didn't ask the question because you weren't sure what the answer would be. Maybe the state governments would have said yes, and then you wouldn't be able to raise the argument that it might damage the relationship between the federal government and the state government. Don't ask a question if you don't know what the answer's going to be!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We had exactly the same issue arise earlier this week with respect to the proposed redevelopment of the Gabba cricket ground in my home state of Queensland and the potential impact on East Brisbane State School, a state school that has been in existence since 1899. My state government in Queensland, the Palaszczuk Labor government, is talking about a redevelopment of the Gabba. It was a $1 billion redevelopment. It has become a $2.5 billion redevelopment which would provide a staggering 8,000 extra seats—8,000 extra seats for $2.5 billion. I have spoken to people who have gone to that school, and I took my good friend the opposition spokesperson Senator Ruston on a tour of that school, a beautiful school, and the school community want to know the future of their school. What's going to happen to their school? They've got a right to the answers to those questions. They have a right to know. Yet all we get is a blanket refusal—not even bothering to pick up the phone and ask the state government whether or not they would object. At least, if you did that, then the people of Queensland could rightly go to the Queensland state government and say, 'Why are you objecting to that? We have a right to know.' </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, I'd also like to say that we always know when we've hit the mark with Minister Watt when he goes from dealing with the substance of the point to making personal reflections on those on this side of the chamber. I just want to say about my friend and colleague Senator McKenzie that I don't think anyone could have discharged their obligations to this place with as much decency and honour as Senator McKenzie did in the course of the last parliament. I think she met every single standard that should be expected of a minister in the Westminster system, and she should be applauded for that. With that, I thank you, Madam Acting Deputy President, for the opportunity to make those remarks.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:42</span>):  As a bit of a history lesson about how this chamber operates and how this parliament operates, public interest immunity is defined on our own parliamentary website this way:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Under the doctrine of 'public interest immunity', historically described as 'Crown privilege', the Executive Government may seek to claim immunity from requests or orders, by a court or by Parliament, for the production of documents on the grounds that public disclosure of the documents in question would be prejudicial to the public interest.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, that all seems pretty sensible to me. But the big problem that we've got is that we seem to have, at that point, deviated significantly from the process. The claim made by the minister when he came in here briefly before was that it would prejudice relations between the Commonwealth and the states. Following on from Senator Scarr's contribution, I'll read to you what that actually entails: 'The information concerned belongs to the states as well as the Commonwealth and therefore should not be disclosed without seeking the approval of the states.' The obvious response to this is that the agreement of the states to disclose the information should be sought before the government refuses to provide the information and must be given the opportunity to give reasons why such an objection should be sustained.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So what we've got here right now is a government who has gone, 'We have public interest immunity ability; we're going to apply it. We'll just forget about all the process that sits in between it.' As rightly pointed out by Senator Scarr, a conversation with the South Australian government yesterday and with the Queensland government yesterday, and with every government in Australia today on the grounds of this particular claim would actually have enabled this government to follow an appropriate process. You do not care about process—you do not care about it—and, quite clearly, even a convention as important as public interest immunity in this place is being completely disregarded. It's also interesting to note that you cannot claim public interest immunity—this is via a doctrine from the former Clerk of the Senate, Harry Evans, one of your guys, who said—</span>

                    </a>  The advice was actually received from Harry Evans. It says that advice to the government is not exempt through public interest immunity. But it also says that working documents are not exempt from public interest—sorry, are exempt from public interest immunity. Therefore, what we seek is for those opposite and the minister to come back into this room and tell us what conversations you've had with the states and territories, what objections have been put forward by them and why these documents can't be released. Also come back into this place and provide us with any information that is outside the scope of that claim, as per the guidelines designed by the previous clerk of this place.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's embarrassing. There are no reasons why you can't release much of this information. Firstly, the tables outlining the list of funded projects were disclosed to the Senate in the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport Legislation Committee on 2 December by the minister. Speaking for the minister, the department secretary, Mr Betts, advised that the minister conceded that the states and territories had adequate time to consider the budget funding tables. These tables are now also listed on the Federal Financial Relations website, for anyone to peruse. How in the world could the government justify a public interest immunity to schedules contained in letters where the schedules have already been disclosed?</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This leaves the tabling of the cover letters themselves, between the Prime Minister and the ministers in the states and territories. If what we have been told is true, these letters should not be controversial and there should be no reason to withhold them from the Senate. There should be no reason for the states to be sensitive about the contents of those letters. We are talking about letters that have been discussed and disclosed by Mr Betts, the Secretary of the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development, Communications and the Arts, in Senate estimates. You guys are running a protection racket.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="296215" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator COX</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:47</span>):  I know it's some time, as others in this place have mentioned, since the Governor-General actually gave his address. In that address the Governor-General stated:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The Government commits to engage closely and respectfully with First Nations people, and the Australian community more broadly, ahead of the referendum.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It shouldn't actually take an item of the government's agenda to treat First Nations people in this country with respect. This respect should not be limited to a referendum process, and First Nations people should be treated with respect from the day our land was actually invaded and every day since then. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yet, First Nations people are continuing to fight for their land and their sea country, for the protection of their cultural heritage and, in particular, for their human rights in this country. Unfortunately, much of this has already been destroyed. We see this particularly at Murujuga and Juukan Gorge and the development projects such as Barossa, Beetaloo, Scarborough and the Narrabri gas fields. The list goes on and on and is quite extensive, and time and time again we have seen the cultural heritage of traditional owners tossed aside in the name of corporate interests. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Murujuga contains the largest and oldest collection of rock art in the world. As of this week, it has been referred to the UNESCO World Heritage Committee, yet this government will not commit to stopping the expansion of projects on the Burrup Peninsula that continue to destroy this ancient cultural heritage. They have in fact continued to help fast-track Pluto 3 and 4, with the acid rain that rains down from the emissions destroying this wonderful rock art and, in fact, impacting on the songlines of the seven sisters in this area. Traditional owners refused permission to have these rocks relocated on multiple occasions—particularly the Circle of Elders—making it clear that their preference was for this rock art to remain undisturbed and intact. They agreed to the removal of those rocks that contain that rock art only once they were advised that it wasn't possible or even an option for that to remain intact.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Nothing about this process at Murujuga respects the principles of free, prior and informed consent. It is coercion, it is manipulation and it is continued through a 40-year-old BMIEA agreement between the state and the traditional owners in that area. This agreement allows industry to run rampant, and traditional owners to have a little say on the side and be consulted with, but in fact nothing in this agreement is about consent. It clearly does not outline their consent in relation to the removal of those rocks, what's happening with Pluto 3 and 4, and the expansion of the Woodside project there. The traditional owners clearly did not consent after much discussion with the state and federal government. In fact, the campaign on Save our Songlines has submitted their section 10 protest to this removal of rocks, both here where the fossil fuel industry grows right before their very eyes and at the Perdaman Euroa fertiliser site.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's move to the Tiwi Islands, where traditional owners challenged NOPSEMA, the independent regulator, and Santos over their lack of consultation. 'Lack of consultation' is putting that really nicely for the Barossa gas project. But guess what? They won. They won because there were two emails and an unanswered phone call—that was all that Santos thought the traditional owners from the Munupi clan—one clan group of eight—deserved as part of consultation. Tell me, fellow colleagues in this chamber, does that sound like respectful engagement to you for people whose land it is? This case has set a legal precedence now to put fossil fuel companies in this country on notice—and so it should. This has sector-wide implications, and I congratulate the Munupi people of the Tiwi Islands, their traditional owners, for taking a stand against industry. In fact, they are the cultural giants. They are the people that deserve to be consulted and to provide their consent for what is happening on their land and sea country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These sites are important not only to traditional owners but also to all of us in this country—First Nations people or not. This is our collective history. It is our culture, and we should all be proud of this. We should all be eager to protect it. It's unacceptable that, time and time again, First Nations people are being forced to give up and, in fact, made to stand by and watch as people rip the soul out of our country and destroy our water. We are left standing there as innocent bystanders, unable to say anything because cultural heritage is for sale in this country and it's for somebody else's profit.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Time and time again, we've heard that cultural heritage laws in this country are too weak and they must be strengthened. The government now must walk the walk, because at this moment, they're doing what the government did before, and before, and before. Successive government legacies are left behind about taking advantage of these weak laws at the expense of traditional owners in this country and at the expense of First Nations cultural heritage in this country. You may ask, 'What is the solution to that?' The solution is very simple. It is to adopt all three elements of the Uluru Statement From the Heart plus stronger cultural heritage laws and other legislative changes like the ratification of the UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People. These all play a pivotal and important role in protecting our cultural heritage, and I will keep fighting for all of them to be included.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The quote of the Governor-General during his speech is:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… the Government will invest in First Nations management of lands and waters, humbly recognising the skills and knowledge gained over tens of thousands of years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a great statement, but, once again, we must centre and we must make sure that the respect for First Nations science, which should have already been done from day one, is actually actioned, is done, is there, isn't allowed to be moved and taken away. With our deep connection to our water, our land and our precise methods of maintaining our vast and diverse lands that have been supported and not systemically destroyed by people who came here after that, we could be living, in fact, in a very different nation now. But, once again, we have to fight for hundreds of years just to have our ancient knowledge acknowledged, respected and taken seriously.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the Australian Greens portfolio hold for science, I really look forward to seeing government's genuine investment in First Nations science and the government treating it on equal footing with Western science in this country. One is no better than the other, and they are systems with deep understanding of which the world we live. We, as the traditional owners and custodians of this country, have been caring for it for tens of thousands of years. It is well beyond time that we strengthen and make stronger legislative standards surrounding First Nations cultural heritage and allow First Nations people to take a self-determined role to care for their own land and water. We may not be able to recover what we've lost, but by God we could absolutely protect what is still left. But we have to act now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is, in fact, why I am here in this place. I will continue to raise my voice and to hold this government to account just as we've heard from members of the opposition. The Greens will continue to talk about the issues that are important, because we don't want this referendum to be a farce. We don't want this process not to deliver any of the important things that I've just referred to and that the Governor-General came into this place and talked about when we all started here last year. We want a process that is fulsome, that is going to deliver outcomes for First Nations people in this country, because we can't just keep hearing the rhetoric that people keep using about this as if it's 'over there'. This is an issue that needs to be centred in this place, and it is now time.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="252157" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WALSH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:58</span>):  I too rise to speak in response to the Governor-General's address at the opening of this 47th Parliament. Given the importance of the ongoing process of reconciliation in that address and to our own government's agenda, I'd first like to acknowledge the traditional custodians of the land that we're meeting on today and pay my respects to their elders past, present and emerging. I also want to extend my respect to the Wurundjeri and Bunurong people, the traditional owners of the land on which I live and work in my home state of Victoria. I remind the chamber that it was the Rudd Labor government back in 2008 that invited traditional owners to first hold such a welcome to country ceremony as we are so often now accustomed to participating in here in this parliament. On that very same day, it was the Rudd Labor government that delivered the national apology to First Nations people. Both were important steps in the long march towards reconciliation, and under the Albanese Labor government, we will take another significant step towards reconciliation by implementing the Uluru Statement from the Heart in full. It's a statement that invites us to walk alongside First Nations people in a movement for a better future—a future that calls for a voice, for treaty and for truth.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This year, a referendum on the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice will occur, and it's about two things: recognition and consultation. The Voice will empower First Nations people, because, for too long, decisions have been made about First Nations communities and not with them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm proud that, in my home state of Victoria, the Andrews Labor government is well underway in our own treaty and truth-telling process. The Australian people will have the opportunity to embrace the invitation of the Uluru Statement from the Heart under our government—a process that we can all engage with as we move forward together.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The federal election in May last year offered Australians a real choice. It was a choice between more of the same from those opposite, or a change of direction with an Albanese Labor government—a Labor government committed to delivering a better future for all Australians. Back then the people made their choice, and now we are getting on with delivering that future. We are tackling the big challenges that we face with the mix of urgency and steadiness characteristic of our team. We're taking real action on climate change. We're repairing our international reputation and strengthening relationships with our Pacific family. We're getting on with the job of rebuilding Australian manufacturing by establishing the National Reconstruction Fund. We're strengthening our Medicare system to ensure access for all. We're putting transparency, integrity and compassion back into politics, and we're facing the cost-of-living crisis and the inflation pressure head on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my first speech, I spoke about the jobs crisis that we face in this country. I spoke about a crisis of low and stagnant wages and rising job insecurity—a crisis that the former government not only refused to address, but celebrated as a deliberate design feature of their economic plan. I said back then that we needed to change direction, and we have. I said at the time that we needed government to get back in the driver's seat and back to work, and I'm proud that the Albanese Labor government is doing just that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've put good, secure jobs at the centre of our plan for a better future. We've put determination to deliver at the heart of our government, starting with successfully advocating for a real pay rise for Australia's lowest-paid workers. In doing this, we brought together unions, employers, community groups and governments to map the path forward to delivering secure, well-paid jobs and strong sustainable wages growth, allowing Australians to not just keep their heads above water but to actually thrive and flourish.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that the Australians who sent us here are counting on us, so we're bringing our connection with Australian workers and the struggles they face right onto the floor of this parliament. We're bringing their stories and their determination for a better life to the heart of our government—stories of the hope to earn enough to be free from worry; stories of the need for more security, to buy a home and to plan for the future; stories of the belief that, in Australia, of all countries, a fair day's work for a fair day's pay is never too much to ask.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We will always stand up for the women workers of Australia and we will always stand up for women to be safe at work, and at home and everywhere. It's why we've legislated 10 paid days of domestic and family violence leave, as I had the privilege to speak about in the chamber yesterday after what I can only describe as a truly remarkable and inspirational speech from my colleague representing the Northern Territory, Malarndirri McCarthy, about the challenges of family violence in her community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Because we want to stand up for women being safe everywhere, paid domestic and family violence leave is in place in this country today, and it's a policy that will save lives. Because we want to stand up for the women of Australia, we put gender equality at the heart of our industrial relations system. We've made it an objective of the secure jobs, better pay bill that passed the parliament last year. It's why we've introduced, just now, in this sitting, the workplace gender equality bill, spearheaded by the Minister for Women, who's also the Minister for Finance, Minister Gallagher. We will not ignore the women of Australia. We have never ignored their pain or their protests, and we have not shut them out of our own party. Indeed, we are proudly a government with women on 52 per cent of our benches. We are here to listen to the women of Australia, and we will.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We'll also fight for good, secure jobs in manufacturing, as we are doing right now with the passage of the National Reconstruction Fund bill through the parliament. My home state of Victoria is the heartland of Australian manufacturing, and it's something that we Victorians are really proud of. Victorians, and all Australians, want us to make more of what we need right here at home. Australians want to be proud that we can stand on our own two feet, and they want a government that invests in industry—industry that can deliver the quality jobs of the future, jobs that Australians can count on. So I'm proud to be here as part of an Albanese Labor government that has hit the ground running and that's prioritised rebuilding Australian manufacturing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The contrast couldn't be clearer with the previous government when it comes to Australia's manufacturing industries and our sovereign capability. The previous government pushed the car industry off a cliff, they failed to seize the opportunity of an Australian-made path to emissions reductions and they failed to prioritise Australian medical manufacturers, even during the pandemic crisis. They sat back while thousands of manufacturing jobs were lost every year. Our government's vision for a better future is one that is made right here in Australia, and our flagship legislation to achieve that will establish the $15 billion National Reconstruction Fund. We on the government benches know that this reform will support our communities by creating good, secure jobs that are well paid in our manufacturing industries. At the same time, we will be able to diversify and grow our economy, and ensure our supply chains and our sovereign capability.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">By putting Australian manufacturers first, we'll ensure that our path towards net zero emissions is one that actually creates Australian jobs, because there is a global race on to seize the opportunities of a renewable energy future. But we all remember how the former government felt about races. Instead of putting Australia at the front of this global race, they wasted nearly a decade. The former government was just too divided to agree on the science of climate change and the solutions that we need to put in place to embrace a renewable energy future. They were too busy fighting each other to step up and lead, and, instead, they've left us behind the rest of the pack.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But what we, as the Albanese Labor government, know is that our country and our region are facing the worst of this climate emergency. We know that Australia has the chance to become a renewable energy superpower, and we know that Australians, more than anything, just want us to get on with it. They want an end to the climate wars, and it's why we legislated our emissions reduction targets of 43 per cent by 2030 and net zero by 2050. And it's why we're getting on with creating new jobs in the industries of the future, like wind, solar and battery manufacturing, with announcements focused on the battery industry made by Minister Husic just this week. These are jobs that are important in my home state of Victoria, where we're building offshore wind in Gippsland in partnership with the Victorian state government. The Albanese government have a plan to deliver more jobs, more opportunities and more economic growth for our country while we also play our part to act on the world's climate emergency.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're also getting on with the job of delivering meaningful investments that maximise economic impact and meet community needs. We understand that the cost of living is hitting Australians hard, and our economic plan is a direct and deliberate response to the challenges facing the economy, most notably the cost of living. That's why one of the very first acts of this government was to successfully argue for the minimum wage to keep pace with inflation, an outcome which helped around 2.7 million Australians keep their head above water. Our October budget focused on cost-of-living relief that didn't put any extra pressure on inflation. That was the critical objective of our October budget. That calm and sensible approach was noted by ratings agencies. In affirming our AAA credit rating they actually pointed to the fact that our budget did not add to inflation pressure as a factor in their decision-making.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are delivering more affordable housing, including through the new National Housing Accord. We're making child care cheaper and expanding Paid Parental Leave. We're delivering 180,000 fee-free TAFE places in 2023. We're making medicines cheaper. We were the first government ever to reduce the PBS co-payment. This will mean that the maximum Australians will have to pay for essential medicines on the PBS is $30, saving around $300 a year for the average person and ensuring that no-one has to miss filling a script because they just can't afford the medications they need. Pensions, allowances and rent assistance are all increasing in line with inflation. We've also bought in the new pensioner work bonus so that older Australians can keep more of what they earn without affecting their pension. And we're proud to be getting wages moving again. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the past three years we have taken the time to listen to Australians, and we've been able to bring the stories of Australians right to the heart of our new government. We've heard their stories of hope for a better future. We've heard their stories of the need for more security in their jobs and in their lives. We've heard the belief of Australians that we can be better together, and we share that belief and we're fighting for it. We have a hope for a better future for our next generation. We know people need security to plan their lives. We know that together we can build a more caring society and one that is strong, diverse and builds people up, not leaves them behind.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="281503" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CICCONE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Government Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:13</span>):  It has been just over half a year since the Australian people elected the Albanese Labor government with a vision for a better future, and we've not wasted a single moment, as others would have heard also in the comments of my good friend and senator for the state of Victoria. One of the government's very first acts after coming into office was to successfully argue for a significant increase to the minimum wage—it was over five per cent—after almost a decade of the former Liberal and National government deliberately keeping wages low. As pressures on global supply chains around the world and increasing interest rates continue to put upward pressure on the cost of living, wage increases ensured that the purchasing power of everyday Australians, mainly our lowest-paid workers, did not slip backwards. For too long the federal government hadn't been in the Fair Work Commission arguing on the side of workers to receive their fair share. In fact, they had been happy to see wages fall in real terms. They famously described low wage growth as a deliberate design feature of their economic architecture.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The real wages of essential workers—those who work in retail stores, those working in hospitality, cleaners, nurses and all those who worked on the frontline during COVID who were working long hours to make sure we all could manage to get to the supermarket and get our food and get our masks and who worked tirelessly throughout the night to ensure we were kept safe and, really, got us through the worst of the pandemic—unfortunately had been slipping for many years under the coalition government. But now these workers finally have a government that is on their side and is going to the independent umpire, arguing on their behalf for increased wages. The Labor government is arguing for a decent wage increase that keeps up with the cost of living, and this is already bearing fruit, with the Fair Work Commission's most recent decision. This is on top of the government's commitment to increase wages for those in the aged-care sector and other sectors that have been underfunded for many, many years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Wages aren't the only thing that working people are worried about. We are all concerned about retirement outcomes. The most essential ingredient for a successful retirement is a healthy superannuation balance. The Liberals have always been on the wrong side of the super debate, sadly. They have undermined super by endlessly delaying increases in the superannuation guarantee and using it as a fix for their own political problems internally within the coalition. But, in contrast, federal Labor believes in a very strong super system, one that actually works for members and delivers positive returns on behalf of working Australians. We know that super plays an important role in our economy and is essential to ensuring positive retirement outcomes for working families. So it was very positive to see a permanent increase in the superannuation guarantee from 10 per cent to 10½ per cent. What does this mean? It means, for the average worker, they will see around an extra $15,000 when they come to retire. That's a very significant increase for millions of Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another major focus of our government has been repairing and improving our international relationships. It was only three days after the federal election that the Prime Minister, Anthony Albanese, was representing Australia at the Quad Leaders Summit, setting our commitment to Liberal democratic values and a free, open and resilient Indo-Pacific, especially with the issues we have had to deal with over the last little while with respect to China and other issues. We recognise the fact that it is in the mutual interest of nations that are committed to democracy to collaborate in multinational and multilateral bodies like the Quad. It was very important for the Prime Minister to represent our country at that meeting.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our involvement in these bodies does not in any way dilute or compromise Australian values. Rather, it engages the international community. That is, as I said, the responsible way to assert and protect our values, which we have fought so hard for in the region. I have been particular pleased to make contributions to these efforts as the newly elected chair of the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee. I am very passionate about ensuring our values are protected and asserted on the world stage. I look forward to continue to work with all my colleagues on the committee in Australia's national interest.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia has a proud history of standing up for our own backyard, particularly with the international threats of China and the issues around the Taiwan Strait but also those closer to home in the Pacific. We are re-engaging in with our Pacific island friends and putting out a hand and seeing what support we can offer them after these troubling times over the course of COVID. We're assisting our Pacific neighbours where possible. I think it's fair to say that we have been greeted with open arms and a change of attitude towards how they see Australia on the international stage. We have to get right to work on repairing those relationships through not just direct engagement but also policy shifts that are in the interests of both Australia and our Pacific family.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our international efforts go beyond the Indo-Pacific. Prime Minister Albanese attended the NATO summit and also took up President Zelenskyy's offer to visit Ukraine. There, the Prime Minister witnessed firsthand the devastating impact of Russia's illegal invasion and announced additional military support, including more Bushmasters, made down in Bendigo in my home state, Victoria. Just as we did in opposition, our government condemns Russia's invasion and will continue to support the Ukrainian defence effort.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're also following through on our election commitment to stronger action on climate change, investing in new technologies and legislating a sensible target to ensure that we do meet not just business and community expectations but expectations right across the world. Businesses have been desperate for almost a decade to have some certainty as well—certainty to ensure that they can also invest in newer technologies to tackle climate change and create high-paying jobs in this country. It was clear that the country needed a change in climate policy direction, and the National Farmers Federation and the Business Council of Australia have both welcomed our Powering Australia plan. This desire for change was clearly evident in the election result back in May of last year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's plan for economic opportunities across regional Australia acknowledges the contribution that farmers are already making towards our climate goals, and I do hope that all senators recognise the urgent need for policy certainty in this space and support the Albanese government's efforts to reduce our emissions and create these new jobs, with a particular focus on the regions. It is very important that we do support our regions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The consequences of the coalition's policy failures in this area have never been more obvious than in the energy crisis that hit Australia in early June of last year. Our ageing transmission grid simply could not get renewable energy, grow it in abundance and reduce it in price every day to get it to where it needs to be today. Especially with the uptake of new technologies and cars, particularly with vehicles using electricity, it is important that we start to upgrade our electrical grid right across the country to ensure that we can supply that bandwidth of energy that's needed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Liberals and Nationals are also not very good at announcing their energy policies. When they did, they had a lot of practice in changing their minds on many, many occasions. Their dismal failure was in delivery: they announced a lot of ideas, but, when it came to delivery, there was nothing more than a media release. I'll give one example. There were $1 billion of energy projects that never generated power at all and oversaw four gigawatts of power leaving the energy market while only one gigawatt actually came online. We ultimately had a deficit of around three gigawatts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But we are getting on with the job and fixing this mess. It's clearer than ever that our plan to upgrade the energy grid is essential. Senators should recognise this and support the government in its efforts to clean up this mess. Early last year I spent a bit of time in the Senate talking about how Australia also needs to rebuild its domestic manufacturing capabilities, something that I think has been neglected for some time. The global uncertainty dominated the headlines for some time, but it certainly put on the table and exposed our supply chains that were lacking investment and lacking vision. You could actually feel the impact, especially when people were rushing to go to the supermarket in order to get goods and services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite the devastating impact that was felt around the nation during COVID, there have also been moments of great opportunity. One part of our economy where the greatest opportunity has been experienced is agriculture. I've spoken quite a bit about agriculture and the resilience of the ag industry in this place. Australia's agriculture industry adapted above expectations. Despite arbitrary tariffs and restrictions on goods that we saw from overseas, such as on beef, wine and barley, producers have shown time and time again a strong ability to diversify their export destinations and establish routes in new markets. I really do want to take my hat off to all those who were involved.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other side of the ag equation, the inputs that are required to produce all the goods that we are exporting, is not nearly as diversified and had not received nearly as much attention from the previous government. I think there are attempts here to at least try and rectify some of those. I'm not trying to lay the blame squarely at the last government but I do think that—</span>

                  </a>  Just 99 per cent. I think there are genuine attempts to rectify but also train our business community that we shouldn't always be investing just in one country. It is important that we don't have all our eggs in the one basket. It's about also encouraging that mindset of thinking 10 steps ahead, just in case there is, unfortunately, another pandemic or disaster in the future. It is important that there is support there by government. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The department of agriculture, when they did their most recent snapshot of the industry, showed that Australian ag accounted for 11 per cent of all our goods and services that were exported, including value-adding processes. Ag, forestry and fisheries contributed about 12 per cent to GDP. That was around $150 billion every single year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ag has always been part of our national history and a very strong source of prosperity, given its importance to our economy generally. But Australian businesses have already been feeling the impact of the global supply chain disruptions, amid a perfect storm of factors. From COVID, we had increased consumer spending, we had Labor shortages and we had climate related disasters. On top of that, China ended up banning urea, which made the problem a lot worse. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we know, urea is a very important ingredient. I think, at the time, there was some media around how that would have impacted on AdBlue, an additive used in fuels for a lot of our trucks. Without our trucks moving this country, quite frankly, Australia stops. Our truckies do a fantastic job. I want to pay tribute to any of those listening on ABC radio. I just hope they're doing a great job, especially those up in northern Western Australian at the moment who are, no doubt, transporting quite a bit of goods between Perth and Darwin, and God knows where else they're coming from. Good on them for the hard work they do. There were moves to reduce urea exports, which did expose how resilient sections of the Australian economy were on the global supply chain. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is just one example of where the previous government was left scrambling to find alternative sources. But I think it's fair to say that we have all learned, in this place, our lessons. There are genuine attempts to ensure that such issues don't occur or are, at least, minimised. We need to make sure that we do start to minimise our risks in this country, when it comes to our global supply chains. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The pandemic also demonstrated that Australia must proactively take steps to secure its supply of key economic inputs. This will require scaling up domestic manufacturing. It's why the Albanese government is working very hard with industry to develop capabilities that we need to ensure that Australian's supply chains remain resilient. This should not be mistaken for a foreign policy that would see Australia withdraw from the international community. Our country has and always will be a trading nation. But it is prudent that as a trading nation we take steps to secure all aspects of our supply chain, including necessary inputs, and where these inputs can be made here, they should so do. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important that we back in our manufacturing sector, because it is so important that we retain the number of jobs that support our regional communities right across Australia. Australia must be a country that makes things here. </span>

I want to make this one point. There's an old proverb that says, 'Hope deferred makes the heart sick.' This government, over here, when they were in opposition, took to the Australian people a whole bunch of things and promised a lot, and what we're seeing is that they are not delivering—firstly, on energy prices. They said, over 90 times—the Prime Minister himself said it—that Australians will see a reduction of their electricity bills by $275. Yet we've seen them abandon that. They're not pursuing it, whatsoever. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, where 'hope deferred' is certainly making the heart sick is in some of our regional communities, particularly in my home state of Western Australia. There are towns like Laverton, Leonora, the Goldfields, Kalgoorlie and the East Kimberley, where you have the cashless debit card. They took to the Australian people the abolition of the cashless debit card, promising that doing so would resolve problems, but all we've seen is that it has exacerbated the domestic violence and abuse that's going on in these towns. This has happened on their watch because of their pursuit of inner-city ideology that is getting in the way of practical solutions for communities, which is what the cashless debit card was.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CASH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:30</span>):  There is a crisis unfolding in the Western Australian Goldfields towns of Leonora and Laverton, which the Albanese government is directly responsible for and, quite frankly, should be absolutely ashamed of. These towns are being ravaged by alcohol-fuelled violence and dysfunction as a direct result of government policy failure. By withdrawing the cashless debit card from these communities, the Albanese government has left women and children in grave danger. Shire of Laverton president Patrick Hill told me and the media this week:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The kids are not getting fed, the women get bashed up, and it's just going back to the way it was.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Hill himself told me yesterday that some residents and visitors from other communities are 'lining up for opening time at the local bottle shop, buying bottles of spirits by the carton and drinking them like Coke'. They recently found 23 spirit bottles on a local oval after one session. After discussions with the police, the only pub in the town, the Desert Inn Hotel, voluntarily imposed alcohol restrictions this week to combat the public unrest in the town.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The disgraceful thing about all of this is that the Albanese government was warned by this community and those on the ground right there last year that this would be the result if they abolished the cashless debit card. Those on the ground in those communities begged the Albanese government, 'Please don't do it.' They told them this was the only thing that had made a real difference in the town. It meant the kids were being fed and women did not have to live in fear. But, as we know, the Albanese government didn't listen to them at the time, and they aren't listening now. This is a total abrogation of responsibility. The Albanese government should admit that abolishing the cashless debit card was wrong, restore it and stand up for these communities.</span>

Rural and regional communities are too often forgotten about, overlooked or dismissed in the public debate, particularly young people who live in those communities. Last week, I travelled to Nambucca to meet with the council, a diverse range of local kids in year 11 and year 12 who are supported by Becoming U, a place-based youth outreach organisation run by Uniting. The council is the first of its kind in the Nambucca Valley. While I was there, I asked these young men and women, 'What is the one thing that you really think needs to change in Nambucca?' The resounding answer from them was 'transport'. They have extremely overcrowded school buses, with three kids to a seat, students crammed up and down the aisles and school bags scattered everywhere. For them, it's not just a five-minute trip; for many, it's at least an hour-long bus ride to and from their rural homes. This is a daily reality for young people in that region just to get to school, let alone to travel between towns on the weekend.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These young people also want to have a say in the events that the town holds and the way it is planned, so that other young people can engage in their community the same way that they have. They met, trained and rehearsed, and they went to the local council—Nambucca Valley Council—and spoke up. It's a daunting experience for young people, but they are very impressive young people with very fine leadership qualities who are absolutely committed to their community. I urge the local council, and their colleagues in the state parliament as well, to listen to these young people and resolve the issues.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I thank the students, their community connector, Isabel, and the principal of Nambucca Heads High School, Dot Panaretos, for welcoming me into the school. We can learn a lot from these young people.</span>

The bill creates a power for the removal of access to lucrative entitlements by former governors-general where they are found to have engaged in serious misconduct. The ability to remove entitlements in cases of proven serious misconduct exists for all similar offices, whether MPs, judges or senior public officials. The need for this has been highlighted this week, as former Governor-General Peter Hollingworth has finally faced an Anglican church inquiry into serious allegations of his mishandling of child sexual abuse claims.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Child abuse survivor Beth Heinrich spoke about my former colleague Rachel Siewert's efforts to make this change, saying: 'I feel if he'd had any integrity, he would have said, "I won't be accepting the Governor-General's pension."' Steve Fisher, a survivor and the current CEO of Beyond Abuse, gave me these words to share with the chamber today:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Ever since Hollingworth resigned in disgrace and we found out he was getting a generous gift from the taxpayer, victim survivors have felt that it was completely wrong.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">It does not pass the pub test, it doesn't resonate—and that's not just with the survivors but the general public who look at this and think "what a rort."</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thank you to Steve and so many other survivors for your courage and ongoing advocacy. While I deliver these words, though, former Governor-General Hollingworth continues to take and take from the public. In just the five years from 2016 to 2021, the former Governor-General took over $3 million in payments and entitlements—all for an 18-month-long job that he resigned from in disgrace. As Steve said: that doesn't pass the pub test. So now it's time for this bill to pass the test of politics and become law.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:36</span>):  It has become apparent that sending your child to a South Australian public school might be the worst thing you could ever do to them. We all know that the education system has been thoroughly captured by progressives and those who benefit from big-state ideology, but every now and then it's helpful to be reminded with a concrete example of how insane some of this stuff has become.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's come to my attention that a public school in Adelaide has developed a points system rewarding students for their woke actions, and I've got the document to prove it. Under this woke social credit system, five points are awarded to a student who is seen to be 'apologising and correcting themselves or someone else for using incorrect pronouns' or 'challenging racial, sexual or homophobic language or actions' and even 'authentically using an acknowledgement of country before a presentation in class'. Remember: it's got to be authentic. There will be none of these half-hearted welcomes to country for these schools.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, in a public school, students spend around six hours a day with an activist curriculum which coaches them into gender dysphoria, hatred of white people and excessive self-awareness about their so-called privilege. If your child in South Australia decides that they want to switch genders thanks to a video they saw on TikTok, the school may even encourage them to pursue the path of puberty blockers against your wishes. That's in the SA Department for Education's own documents. To top it off, this particular school penalises non-compliance with this social credit system.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's clear our public education system no longer educates children but brainwashes them in the hope of shaping them into activists. The Marxists are moving into the next stage of their craven operation. They're doubling down on capturing our children and developing the next generation of child woke soldiers.</span>

              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The program was an opportunity to meet with political, academic and advocacy leaders in the US, particularly those who have an interest in the relationship between our two countries. We flew into Washington DC in mid-January, and we spent the bulk of the week talking about and looking at—and understanding, I should say—the important international symbols for democracy and freedom. We also managed to talk to these political and academic leaders about our engagement and the United States' engagement in the Indo-Pacific region and the impact of China that it is plain right now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the course of the week, we received briefings from US departments on several policy issues. Of course, AUKUS was a major focus, as it represents a significant collaboration between our two great countries. We also discussed other policy areas, including manufacturing, energy and climate, which are a major focus for both the Biden administration and the Albanese Labor government. I particularly appreciated the tour that we did of congress and seeing some of the differences and similarities between our chambers and our democratic systems. It was also fascinating to be able to walk the corridors of the Pentagon and also mark our respects where the aeroplane hit the side of the Pentagon. Thank you very much to our ambassador, Arthur Sinodinos for hosting us at the Australian embassy, as well as ambassador Mitch Fifield, Australia's representative to the United Nations, for taking time to explain about the important work that Australia does on the world stage. I thank the US embassy here in Canberra for organising the tour and the program. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:40</span>):  Yesterday, I released a pamphlet which sets out a Liberal conservative outlook on why the Voice to Parliament is a good idea. I have long been of the idea that it is a good idea because it would empower communities to make good decisions about their own people and it would also aid the country getting to joint decision-making. I think a lot of the debate has been around getting advice to Canberra, and I think that is important. It's important that this chamber and this parliament is able to get better-informed advice. But we also want to be able to work with communities. When I go into communities in western New South Wales and talk to people, I hear they do want to have more capacity to make judgements about practical things in their community. I think that that is a very good idea, a very fair notion and something that we should be working towards.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's also important at this point, though, to make it known that this referendum—if it is to be successful—will need a large proportion of Liberal and National voters to vote yes throughout Australia. I believe that for that to happen it is very important that the outstanding legal issues that have been raised in various quarters are addressed and are able to give people comfort that this is going to be a safe change for Australia, a change that will help Indigenous people, a change that will help the country and also a change that is safe for our Constitution and for our system of government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it is important that there is some more information to be provided. For those of us who want this to work, and for those of us who want a win, we need to be able to explain how this is going to help close the gap on the ground in communities. That's why I believe it's very important that more information is forthcoming in coming months.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:42</span>):  Last week I was informed that Cloncurry, Ingham and Tully would be the sites of the latest Westpac bank closures. I acknowledge that times have changed and there are fewer people going into branches for transactions they would previously speak to a teller about. I acknowledge the partnership between Westpac and Australia Post to allow customers to do their Westpac banking over the Australia Post counter. However, what the closures don't acknowledge is that profits generated by the bank from regional businesses—agriculture, mining, tourism and others—are not then reinvested back to those regions. It is critical that forcing people to do their banking and other government services online means that they must also have access to a reliable, fast internet connection and better phone coverage. These services must be improved in those three towns and others right across regional Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These branch closures will also be felt keenly in the regions as bank staff would volunteer at community events and also provide a pathway for regional young people to have a career in the banking industry. I understand people's concerns with these closures, because it can be frustrating trying to explain a situation to somebody over a phone or via a website chat function. Local staff at a branch meant that finance decisions and lending were done with firsthand knowledge of people's personal circumstances and the realities of life in regional places. But having these branches in town also acknowledged the economic significance of regional areas and, as I mentioned, provided opportunities for young people to start a career close to home.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm grateful to Senator Matt Canavan and the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee for taking on another Senate inquiry into branch closures. I encourage anyone who has concerns to make a submission. I'll be posting a link on my website.</span>

Thank you, Senator Bragg. We certainly hear what you're saying and the comments that you've made. We're also very welcoming of your stance here in the Senate and in the Liberal Party.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:46</span>):  Many times in this chamber I have got to my feet to talk about the chronic underfunding of our public schools. In the last few weeks, students right around the country have gone back to school and, in a cost-of-living crisis, parents and carers have had to grapple with the increasing out-of-pocket costs that they have to contribute for their students, particularly those in a public school. Things like uniforms, technology, excursions and lunches all put a dent in the family budget. But, increasingly, parents and carers, as well as teachers, are having to fund the shortfall for the equipment and resources that our students need in our public schools.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I assisted the staff at Roseberry Queensland in Gladstone, who have a service every year where they provide free materials for students who are returning to school and whose families can't afford those things. Increasingly, the number of people who are seeking that service is getting larger. I was really shocked to see the numbers of things on the students' book lists that our public schools should be providing: photocopy paper and hand sanitiser are things that our public education system should be providing, and parents and carers shouldn't be making up the shortfall.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The latest Productivity Commission report on government services shows that the total per student funding from federal, state and territory governments to the public school sector rose 17 per cent from 2012 to 2021. But during that same period governments increased their total funding to private schools by 27 per cent. In the context of funding agreements, where at the moment, most private schools are getting over— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Australian Capital Territory</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:48</span>):  Today, the government introduced legislation into the other place to establish the Housing Australia Future Fund, the HAFF. That fund aims to add 30,000 new homes to the supply of social and affordable housing stock over the next five years. But over the next three years, the National Rental Affordability Scheme, which was capped at 38,000 social and affordable homes, will be wound up. Unmet social and affordable housing needs stand at 650,000 homes, and by 2041 it is forecast that almost one million Australian households will be in housing stress.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is clearly a massive issue that we're facing. While the HAFF is very welcome, I'm deeply, deeply concerned about the measures currently being proposed. Whilst a big improvement on what was there previously, they don't go anywhere near far enough. And this concern has been echoed by housing peak bodies around the country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The crisis we are currently facing in housing is about to get a whole lot worse. At the same time as NRAS is winding up, one-fifth of home loans, or around 800,000 households, are about to fall off a fixed rate mortgage cliff. Permanent migration is increasing from 160,000 to 195,000, and international students are returning. These aren't bad things, but they are a confluence of extreme pressures on an already deeply stressed housing ecosystem. Rental vacancy rates are at historic lows, while rental price increases are at historic highs. We need to do better. We can do better. I hope that, when the legislation comes to this place, we act together to do just that.</span>

As a senator for WA, and also as a former Minister for Defence, I am proud to have championed and supported this critically important sovereign capability for our nation. However, the ability of our shipbuilding industry in Australia, and particularly in Henderson, to realise its full and growing potential is now seriously constrained by the lack of action by the state government, the McGowan government.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These issues are well known and well documented. For over five years I have been working with the state government to identify these issues and put together a plan to upgrade the facilities. In 2017 I facilitated negotiations and discussions between the then defence industry minister, Christopher Pyne, and Paul Papalia, the defence industry minister in Western Australia. We agreed then, through a series of letters, what needed to be done. Since then, the coalition government has lived up to its end of the bargain. We invested over $1½ billion in the Henderson area and also Garden Island. We also promised nearly $4½ billion for the building of a game-changing dry dock at Henderson.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Alarmingly, both the state and federal Labor governments have gone completely silent on the future of this project. It should be of concern not only to Western Australians but also to all Australians that this important sovereign capability, having a dry dock and a defence marine precinct in Henderson on our west coast, is now in jeopardy. It is not too late. There were five wasted years, but we commissioned the report and we know what needs to be done. It's now up to the McGowan government to get it— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:52</span>):  Recently I had the pleasure of meeting with John Gemmill and Pete Smith, the CEO and President, respectively, of the Clean Ocean Foundation. The Clean Ocean Foundation is a fantastic environmental charity that was formed in 2000 by families, fishermen and surfers who were concerned by the high level of pollution at Mornington Peninsula surf beaches, such as Gunnamatta. The foundation campaigns to limit pollution in our oceans and restore ocean health through its conservation work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was interested to learn about the foundation's campaign to promote and establish recycled water initiatives in Australia. I would guess that most Australians consider desalination to be best practice in water cleaning and conservation, but this is not necessarily the case. In fact, for every one litre of potable water produced through desalination, two litres of polluted water are generated as a by-product. This polluted water is dumped into our oceans and contributes to a range of environmental pressures on marine ecosystems.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia's reefs, beaches and fisheries all suffer when our oceans are not clean. This then affects the sustainability of our economy and our agriculture industry and worsens drought. Tourists do not want to swim in dirty water or visit a dying reef. Australians do not want to eat polluted fish. Our agriculture industry needs water to irrigate our crops, that's for sure.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Having served on the board of Greater Western Water, I'm no stranger to best-practice water policy. Recycled water systems are by far the most sustainable option available to us. Unlike desalination, recycled water does not produce harmful waste outflows that end up polluting our oceans. The water that goes into a recycled system stays in that system. Although La Nina has given us more water than we know what to do with, our system is very fragile. We can make better choices. The challenge for the Clean Ocean Foundation and others is to convince the public and governments that recycled water is the future. That is something I'm glad to say I support.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:54</span>):  I listened really closely to the debate this morning about my colleague Senator Whish-Wilson's private senator's bill to stop the PEP 11 project, which would allow for the expansion of oil and gas exploration. My mood swung between being totally outraged that Labor and Liberal senators alike were arguing to support the expansion of oil and gas mining and use—I was outraged by that—and being really, really sad, and then, finally, being fired up to keep campaigning.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was outraged because I just don't understand this: what don't the people in this chamber understand about the fact that we are in a climate crisis and that if we keep on not just using oil, coal and gas but expanding the production of them and the burning, the mining and the export of them that we are headed for three, if not four, degrees of warming across the planet? Why don't these people understand what that means? It's the increase in severity of floods, fires, rises in sea level, coastal erosion, food availability and skyrocketing food prices. What don't they understand? We are on track, even under the government's 43 per cent climate target, for three or four degrees of warming. We are in a climate crisis; we cannot afford to continue to burn oil and gas and, particularly, to continue with new oil and gas projects. So I was really, really sad that here in 2023 we're still arguing about this. Why can't we acknowledge that we're in a climate crisis? We all need to work together to make improvements so that we have a healthy future.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, finally, I was fired up, inspired by knowing that there are millions and millions of people across Australia and the world who are fighting for a healthy future for us all and properly tackling our climate crisis.</span>

But it's so much more than that. Imagine being scared that you couldn't feed your kids next week? Or because you couldn't get through to someone on the phone? That's the situation for some of the most vulnerable people in our country right now. Their calls to Centrelink are falling on deaf ears, quite literally, because no-one is picking up.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Issues with Centrelink wait times aren't new. I saw them with my clients when I worked in employment services. I helped to fix them when I was Jacqui's office manager. Now that I'm a senator, those calls haven't stopped. In the past few weeks alone, I've had several constituents contact my office. One constituent put in a claim for a carer's payment and, 14 weeks later, they'd heard nothing. In that time, they'd used up long service leave, severance pay and their savings just trying to get by. Another constituent was calling to resolve an issue with family tax benefits. They tried calling for seven hours and had no success. Another person told my office that they'd been trying to call Centrelink on and off for three weeks straight and hadn't made it through to a real person; they'd be on hold for 40 minutes then get cut off. They'd call back, be on hold for 30 more minutes and then be cut off again.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">An article on <span style="font-style:italic;">SBS News</span> earlier this week said that some people are calling up to 15 or 17 times, and still not getting anywhere. I don't blame the staff at Centrelink; they're doing their best with the resources they have. But it's just not enough. I've been helping people with these issues for over 18 years, and things haven't changed—they're just getting worse. We talk about overhauling Medicare and reforming aged care, and all of these things need fixing. But so does Centrelink. There are systemic issues with Centrelink processes, and phone calls are just the tip of the iceberg.</span>

An audit, through questions on notice, revealed that almost 1,000 units of surveillance equipment provided by Chinese-government-linked companies Hikvision and Dahua are installed across more than 250 Commonwealth sites. I welcome defence minister Richard Marles's comments today that they'll be removed from his department. Minister, is the government concerned about this national security risk at other departments and agencies?</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry and Minister for Emergency Management</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:00</span>):  Thank you, Senator Paterson, for the question. I have seen the media coverage regarding this issue in the last couple of days. What I can advise the chamber is that the Attorney-General has requested advice on whether a government-wide ban is required to address protective security risks. Of course, the Albanese government take national security seriously, and we will always act in the national interest.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You may have seen, Senator Paterson, that the defence minister, Mr Marles, has made public commentary to the effect that the government is doing an assessment of all the technology for surveillance within the defence state, and, where those particular cameras are found, they're going to be removed. So there is an issue here, and we're going to deal with it. I think the government has been very clear in taking responsibility for addressing this issue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I can also advise that the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet and its portfolio agencies do not have any installed devices manufactured by the companies concerned. DFAT, Austrade and Tourism Australia retain some legacy Hikvision or Dahua manufactured CCTV systems in non-sensitive areas, and these are not connected to the internet or to agency IT networks.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is worth making the point that these cameras were installed not under the Albanese government but under a coalition federal government. It is good that Senator Paterson is now taking an interest in this issue—an issue that neither he nor anyone in the former government saw as worthy of investigation at the time. Unlike the coalition government, this government is taking action, and, as I say, the Attorney-General has requested advice on whether a government-wide ban is required to address protective security risks. As Senator Paterson knows, having asked those questions on notice, departments and agencies have provided answers to them.</span>

Of course, being government-wide, that does involve every part of this government and every agency, including the ones that you referred to. </span>

That was fine, but now, after the event, it's worthy of asking questions! These are serious matters, no doubt about it, and that's exactly why the Albanese government is taking action, unlike the former Morrison-Turnbull-Abbott-and-whoever-else-there was government. </span>

It's all very well to be wise after the event and ask questions about things that happened when you were in government, but I suggest that the time to actually do something about it was when you were in government and making the decisions to install the cameras, rather than trying to call into question a government that is taking serious action on this, just as it is taking serious action on national security in general.</span>

                  </a>  Indeed. I'm sitting next to another proud South Australian. I begin by acknowledging that the decision by the Reserve Bank this week to raise interest rates will come as quite unwelcome news to households across Australia. Whether you're a mortgage holder or a renter, this interest rate rise will cause extra stress on household budgets. The government has worked day in and day out since being elected looking at ways to bring sensible, responsible and affordable cost-of-living relief to Australian households. Whilst we can't control what the Reserve Bank does with respect to interest rates, we can be a government that focuses on those measures designed to make life easier and that looks at ways to put downward pressure on some of those cost-of-living increases we have been seeing. What is in our control are measures to support and subsidise Australians in buying things that are essential. We're supporting everyday Australians through policies like our cheaper medicines, which came into being on 1 January; importantly, our cheaper child care, which for over one million Australian households will make child care more affordable; and, of course, reducing the increases on energy bills, which those opposite opposed in December last year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our cheaper child care reforms are really important. They are about making it more affordable for families. Also they are good economic policy. In turn, the extra resourcing and investment in child care supports greater workforce participation, especially by women. We've also got our fee-free TAFE policy, so we are investing in skills— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

I don't even think you guys were awake when you were in your last year of government. Certainly, with all of the work we inherited, you must have been asleep at the table. Or maybe you let the former Prime Minister do all the jobs. Remember that? He did have all the jobs—'You guys just go to sleep. I'll not do any of the jobs that I've just taken off you.' We inherited the visa backlog, the skills shortages and the lack of investment in TAFE. These are the areas that we are focused on. We're addressing them one by one, cleaning up the mess of a government that had been there way too long. </span>

The short answers to your questions are: yes and yes. The longer version is that, yes, I do recognise the importance of this payment and rebate for farmers. It is an important way for farmers to manage their budgets. For that reason, I can confirm that this government has no intention whatsoever of getting rid of it. I recognise that the Grattan Institute has made that suggestion, but we have categorically ruled it out, both I and the Prime Minister.</span>

I have made it clear now through Twitter, through ABC Capricornia, through other media outlets and through answering a question in the Senate chamber that touching the diesel fuel rebate is not on this government's agenda. We are not considering it. We are not working on it. That applies to farmers, to fishers, to foresters and to anyone else who takes advantage of this. So that is not on our agenda, and, again, this has been a matter of public record for three or four days. I'm a little concerned that Senator McKenzie and her team aren't keeping up to date with what announcements and commitments the government has made and, instead, choose to perpetuate these scare campaigns day after day. </span>

Last week, the IMF—which, it has to be said, is one of the chief agents of neoliberalism around the planet—suggested that Labor's stage 3 tax cuts should be reassessed. Here in Australia, everyone to the left of Malcolm Turnbull thinks that the stage 3 tax cuts should be ditched. Minister, does your government really believe that Labor's stage 3 tax cuts are good policy? Do you really believe that a quarter of a trillion dollars in tax cuts that overwhelmingly benefit the top end of town are preferable to putting dental and mental health into Medicare, making child care free and wiping out student debt?</span>

I recognise, and I think we all recognise in this chamber, that there are different views around the stage 3 tax cuts, but our policy and our position on those tax cuts haven't changed. Our priority when it comes to tax reform is the tax reform we outlined in the October budget, which is around ensuring multinationals pay their fair share of tax here in Australia. We also acknowledge that those tax cuts aren't scheduled to come in until 2024, and we are focused on the near-term challenges in the economy, including how we ease cost-of-living pressures on households. The inflation challenge and dealing with the associated cost-of-living impacts that it's having are our main focus in terms of the economic portfolio.</span>

We are the responsible fiscal managers of the budget, and people will see, as we go through the detail of what we inherited, just what vandals you were. Looking out and saying, 'We're managing everything,' while sweeping it all under the carpet; pork-barrelling to friends; failing to fund things properly, and having them all fall off a funding cliff in June this year—that's the legacy you leave, and that's the challenge that we are dealing with in the budget.</span>

The Treasurer said this week, 'Labor has a plan for inflation.' The RBA is forecasting that inflation will be above their target band when the stage 3 tax cuts come into effect next year. Isn't it the case that the stage 3 tax cuts are grossly inflationary? Is putting another $9,000 a year into the pockets of billionaires part of your government's plan to address inflation?</span>

I give credit to you, Senator McKim, for managing to squash that into 30 seconds! We covered a whole range of issues there. I do not accept the points made—the negative reflections on our motivations around self-interest. We wanted to change the government. We managed to change the government. We think that is good for the country, in that we are now able to implement all of the policies that we took, such as our positive policies around climate, dealing with those issues that you've been interested and involved in for some time. We are in government, we are dealing with the inflation challenge and we are dealing with some significant budget pressures. We've got to focus on households and cost of living, easing cost-of-living pressures where we can, where it doesn't add to inflation and doesn't make the job of the Reserve Bank harder. This is the job that the Treasurer and I do every day, day in, day out. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Before directly addressing Senator Dodson's question, I'd also like to give a quick update on the deployment of Australian personnel to Turkiye. Tomorrow it is expected that a deployment of 72 personnel from New South Wales Fire and Rescue, DFAT and the National Emergency Management Agency will depart for Turkiye, where they will be tasked by local authorities in supporting search and rescue efforts. These urban search and rescue personnel have internationally recognised skills, and I'm sure they will provide much needed support in ongoing efforts across the impacted communities. I'd like to thank those personnel for this incredible undertaking, and I'm sure I speak for everyone when I wish them well for a safe return. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the meantime the Albanese government is continuing to work closely with the government to support the ongoing recovery in the Kimberley, following the recent devastating flooding. Two NEMA officers have been deployed to two locations in Western Australia to work in the Western Australian department's offices in Perth and with the local council in Derby, West Kimberley. NEMA is working closely with the National Indigenous Australians Agency to identify recovery needs at the community level. Of course, there are a large number of First Nations people who've been dramatically affected by these events, and the Albanese government believes it's essential that traditional owners are part of the conversation on how we support the Kimberley communities and to make sure the recovery happens the way those communities want and need.</span>

                  </span>Again, I'd like to thank Senator Dodson for his ongoing engagement with myself, my office and all of those communities around their recovery needs in the Kimberley. I was on the ground with Senator Dodson and the Prime Minister in Fitzroy Crossing, in early January, and I've seen the power of work being done. In total, more than $2.5 million in Commonwealth disaster assistance has been provided to around 3,200 people in affected communities in Western Australia today, and there's a range of joint support still available. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired) </span></span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since May, after our election, our government has provided $1.6 billion in direct payments to natural disaster impacted communities, across Australia, through the various recovery payments available. It is a sobering fact that $1.5 billion of this $1.6 billion has been delivered to residents of the state of New South Wales. We recognise that New South Wales communities have faced devastating and compounding flooding over the last 12 months, and we recognise that it's our responsibility as the federal government to show up in a crisis and keep showing up to help. What we don't recognise is whether those communities voted Labor, Liberal or Nationals. That's why, regardless of politics, we have continued to provide disaster funding, into the hundreds of millions of dollars, to very safe National Party seats, because those people need help. That is the right thing and that is exactly what we will keep doing. </span>

Unfortunately, just this week, we have seen that not all governments follow the apolitical approach of the Albanese government in supporting communities impacted by natural disasters. I was appalled to read reports that former New South Wales Deputy Premier and New South Wales National Party leader John Barilaro redirected funding away from certain communities that were devastated by the Black Summer bushfires. Why do you think funding was ripped away from them by the former Nationals leader in New South Wales? For one reason, and one reason alone—that's because they were held in state seats held by Labor members. </span>

                  </span>It seems the rorting disease that was in epidemic proportions under the federal Liberals and Nationals also spread its way to New South Wales. What is it with the Nationals and rorting public funds? We know the federal Nationals have lots of form on this. Let's forget about sports rorts for a moment. Let's forget about regional rorts. It even happened with disaster funding as well. Who will ever forget that in the Northern Rivers federal National seats got funding and Labor seats didn't? That is a disgraceful thing to occur and it will never happen under our government. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired) </span></span>

My question is for the Minister representing the Minister for Health and Aged Care, Minister Gallagher. Minister, last year this parliament passed the Aged Care Amendment (Implementing Care Reform) Act 2022. This act primarily responds to recommendations made by the royal commission into aged care on nursing. This act will be fully in effect from 1 July 2023. This week, it was reported in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Examiner</span>, back in Tassie, that there was an aged-care resident in Tasmania who spent the whole night bleeding. The rostered nurse took unplanned leave and the only nurse available was, on call, about two hours away. Will the legislation we passed last year ensure tragedies like this won't happen again?</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I haven't seen that news report, Senator Tyrrell, but I think those stories have been far too common in aged care, which is why we took the policy to the election that we did, around implementing nurses 24/7 into aged-care facilities and increasing the care minutes. Responding to some of the health challenges in aged care has been very difficult for providers where nursers have not been available, and I know that the Minister for Aged Care—in fact, I met with her yesterday on aged-care matters—has been absolutely focused on making sure that nursing 24/7 is implemented. We're looking at workforce shortages, where they are and how we deal with those, and working with providers. The aim is that people who live in residential aged care have access 24/7 to nursing care, which is something that they haven't had, particularly in small and regional areas.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I spent some time working in aged care and visited a number of aged-care facilities, and those aged-care staff do an incredible job caring for people often with very complex health conditions. Sometimes residential aged-care facilities are actually more like a subacute hospital than your traditional thinking of what an aged-care facility would be because of the complexity of the residents who are living there.</span>

How can the standards be up to scratch when they allow people to lie in bed for hours bleeding from wounds that nobody treats? This person was actually sent to hospital the next morning when people came on shift. The situation was it wasn't just a little scratch. We just want things to be right, and we hear that it's a problem. We're here; we're the grown-ups in the room, which I've heard.</span>

And this has been part of the issue, particularly overnight, even on weekends, with residents of aged care deteriorating to the point that they end up acutely unwell when they are transferred to hospital or if they are able to be transferred there before they decline. That is the aim of the 24/7 nursing requirement. I know the Minister for Aged Care has been working, indeed, even with the minister for immigration on how we deal with some of the significant workforce challenges that are present. Part of it is dealing with some of the legacy issues we've inherited, including fixing some of the other workforce shortages, which we'll be doing through the aged-care wages increase. Any suggestion that the 24/7 registered nurse requirement won't be enforced is false; it will be enforced, and providers are aware of that in their discussions with the Minister for Aged Care. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

I'll certainly relay that to the Minister for Aged Care. As you know, we have other measures underway to improve the quality of aged care, including the new star ratings for residential aged care to provide older people and their families with transparency on quality. We've got the extension of the Serious Incident Response Scheme to home care, and a new code of conduct for approved providers, aged-care workers and governing persons from 1 December. I'm not saying this is easy and will fix some of the quality issues overnight; it won't. But these are important reforms that send the very strong message that Australians expect quality aged care to be provided to elderly Australians, that the government has a role in supporting that. We will be doing that with our investments in the aged-care workforce and our investments in 24/7 nursing care. And we'll work with providers to continue to improve it.</span>

                  </a>  I'm very happy to be asked about jobs. I would make the point, first, in relation to this mine—sorry, I was asked about energy first. I'm advised that this was an export-only mine, so obviously there's no energy into our energy grid. Secondly, in addition to the 64,000 jobs which were obviously weighing, I assume, on the minister's mind, I would note also that the government are serious about ensuring that we invest in industry and jobs through our National Reconstruction Fund, an important part of ensuring strong manufacturing jobs, high-vis jobs, here in Australia. Isn't it interesting that those who talk about jobs are about to oppose this. If you want to come in here, Senator, and talk about Australian jobs, we're very happy to talk about Australian jobs and all the jobs you're voting against.</span>

In November 2022 I raised with you the issue of excess mortality as reported by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. The most recent full report from the ABS shows that, for the first nine months of 2022, there were nearly 20,000 excess deaths, which is about 16 per cent more than the baseline average. Of those, 8,160 deaths were attributed to COVID-19. So where are the rest from? Minister, can you please confirm if the department of health have investigated this large increase in excess mortality, and, if they have, can you advise the Senate what is causing this spike in deaths?</span>

I can say that the department of health would, as routine, look at the reports that come out through the ABS. As the senator indicated in his question, there are reports that the ABS does on mortality statistics and reports they do on the causes of death, and of course the department of health would look at those and examine them to see if there are any trends or issues of concern. I'm advised that it's important to note that increases in deaths from a range of causes not related to COVID-19—because there is an indication of excess deaths related to COVID-19—have also been observed in 2022. Examples include deaths due to dementia, including Alzheimer's disease, which were 25.6 per cent above the baseline average in June and 21.8 per cent above the baseline average for the year to June. </span>

COVID-19, as a virus, also impacts health and has those health consequences, like pericarditis and myocarditis. If you have a severe case of COVID-19, that is a side effect and consequence of that. The data shows that those who are unvaccinated—so they haven't had a vaccine, primarily an mRNA vaccine—are much more likely to end up in ICU or passing away. That includes those who are not vaccinated or not up to date with their vaccination. People in my age group are 32 times more likely to end up in hospital if they're not vaccinated. So the answer to the question is: yes, we are confident. The government and the approving authorities are confident that the mRNA vaccine is safe, and we urge people to be vaccinated. <span style="font-style:italic;">(</span><span style="font-style:italic;">Time expired</span><span style="font-style:italic;">)</span></span>

It's not just an individual decision. This is the thing. It's not just about an individual's decision and keeping yourself safe; it's keeping other people safe from this virus—people who aren't able to be as protected as some of us.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 1 January 2023, the second tariff cut under the Australia-India Economic Cooperation and Trade Agreement took effect. In the month of January, Australian businesses benefited from the tariff cuts on over $2.5 billion—I'll repeat that figure: $2.5 billion—worth of exports into India. This means more opportunities for our seafood, our meat, our fruits, our wine and our critical mineral exporters. It means cheaper products for Australian households, like groceries, fruit, nuts and clothing.</span>

You're exactly right about our diversification policies. The Albanese Labor government are getting started on our trade diversification agenda with this important economic partner. Next month, I will travel to India with the Prime Minister and a business delegation to seize the opportunity under our existing free-trade deal and advance negotiations on a comprehensive economic cooperation agreement. We're supporting Australian businesses to diversify their trade and to deliver secure, high-paying jobs for Australian workers and Tasmanian workers.</span>

Over the whole decade that the Morrison government was in power, it did not reach the level of wage growth that is occurring in our country. We know that inflation is continuing to have an effect on Australians' cost of living, and that's exactly why we've taken the steps that we have to address the cost of living, such as the ones that Senator Gallagher was talking about: cheaper medicines, cheaper child care, fee-free TAFE places and, most importantly, the energy price relief that the Albanese government delivered late last year, which was opposed by every single member opposite. That's what the Albanese government is doing on the cost of living.</span>

That's why we will continue to take action on cost of living, and that's why we'll continue to take action on wage growth as well. Let's not forget that, unlike the coalition government, this government made a submission to the Fair Work Commission supporting a pay rise for aged-care workers. Unlike the former government, this government made a submission supporting a decent increase to the minimum wage, and, of course, late last year, this government, against the opposition of the coalition, passed legislation which was designed to get wages moving again by giving—</span>

                  </a>  President, I raise a point of order on the standing order related to the direct relevance of an answer. I raise this point of order particularly about the direct relevance. This chamber, early in my career, made a change to standing orders that went from requiring relevancy to requiring direct relevancy. This question could not have been a more narrowly or precisely worded question. It was 11 words long, and it asked the minister, very clearly, whether the current rate of real wages growth was positive or negative. I accept that he has been broadly relevant to the question, but I contest he is not being directly relevant to the question, and I invite you to draw him to be directly relevant to the question.</span>

But that is not something that this government wants to see go on, and, as I say, nominal wages are growing at a higher rate than we ever saw under the coalition government.

Of course, I'm not in a position to reveal what will be in this government's submission on the next minimum wage case. But it is the government's policy to continue to make sure that we get wages moving again. As I say, it stands in great contrast to the former government, who had a deliberate design feature of keeping wages low and who never achieved the nominal wage growth that we've managed to achieve just in the last few months that we've been in office.</span>

The now minister for employment said, 'The new government does not want to see Australian workers go backwards.' This minister, this question time, has been able to rule in and out budget measures, and yet he won't give any indication as to what the Fair Work Commission submission will say. Minister, isn't it true that Australian workers are going backwards, you won't promise to stop them from going even further backwards and, just like your promises of lower electricity prices, you're breaking your promise— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

The question for those opposite is: are you going to look to the future, or will you just stay stuck in your own past? There are those on the other side—and I note that Mr Dutton's comments were in response to Senator Birmingham and Senator Bragg—actually urging their colleagues to listen to what the electorate said.</span>

In other words, you try and ensure that they also contribute to the net-zero target, which, by the way, those opposite have signed up to. It's a balanced scheme—effective, equitable, efficient and simple—and these are reforms that were first proposed by Mr Taylor and were a recommendation of the 2020 expert panel, which your government accepted and consulted on. What I'd suggest is that those opposite listen to their leader, who said last year, 'When you lose elections, it's important to listen and to understand the reasons why you lost.' But you can't hear. You don't want to hear, do you? I ask that further questions be placed on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Notice Paper</span>.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my contribution, I particularly want to take note of the answer given by Senator Watt to Senator Birmingham's question in relation to the cost of living. What we heard from Senator Watt was just a lot of words, really, and a lot of plans to have a plan. When asked what they were doing to address the cost of living, he said, 'We're taking action,' but there was actually no reference to anything they've done or anything specific that they're going to do that will tangibly deliver reduced cost-of-living pressure on Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, we all know that out there in the real world, outside of this place, people are doing it tough. Interest rates have been going up. For the average mortgage holder, it's about $10,000 per year in increases in interest costs. You go to the shopping centres and not only will you see that, in many cases, the shelves are empty because there are supply chain issues; but costs have gone up significantly as well. It's impacting people's ability to make ends meet. It is becoming increasingly difficult just to get by in this country, and all we're getting from this government is words. There's no substance behind anything they're saying; it's just empty rhetoric. We heard that one of the ways that they're addressing cost of living is by decreasing the cost of child care. That's all well and good if you have a childcare place, but what we know is that the empty impact of the legislation that they were able to get through this place is that it doesn't deliver any new places. There's no, there's not a single new place becoming available. Now, we know that there is a significant shortage of childcare places. With know that there's a significant issue of workforce and there's nothing that this government is doing to address those issues. So how does an increase in a subsidy assist you if you can't even get access to a childcare place?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The point that I'm making here is that they're really good at putting together some words, but Australians are starting to figure it out. The government have had a bit of a honeymoon, and I get that; people have given them the benefit of the doubt, as good, sensible Australians will do. They will give them the benefit of the doubt. But, as the pressures are really mounting on household budgets, as the pressures are really mounting on individuals trying to make ends meet, they're starting to figure out that this government is all talk and very little action. And their action is often symbolic. Their action is often talking points rather than delivering policies that will deliver real outcomes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the things that they said they would do before the election was to deliver a $275 decrease to the cost of electricity, yet they've walked miles from that. They brought in some policy just before Christmas, thinking it would be some big Christmas present—another empty delivery of a promise. We're not actually seeing electricity prices going down. They're saying they're not going to go up as much as they could have. That's not going down; that's maybe limiting it a little bit. You're playing around the edges.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians want to see a reduction in the cost of making ends meet, and it's getting more and more difficult. This government, week by week—and we've seen this week with their agenda that we're back to filling time when it comes to government business. We're back onto the address-in-reply to the Governor-General's speech because they don't have anything. They've done the talking and found that just talking is not enough. Just filling in words and having those nice announcements and nice talking points is not enough to actually address the issues that Australians are facing. They talked about real wages going up before the election. Guess what. They won't even mention the word 'real' any more, because we're not keeping up with inflation. Inflation is out of control, and the Reserve Bank has to take the measures they're taking because they see that this lot over here haven't got the capacity to deliver real outcomes.</span>

Let's mention a few of them: an increase in the minimum wage and pay rise to aged-care workers. Let's mention a few more of them. We turned around and made child care cheaper. We turned around and made changes to the workplace relations bill, which they, of course, opposed because that dealt with the cost of living. They don't want to see real workers get wage increases to deal with the pressures of the cost of living; they just want to make sure a very small, minute percentage of this community—at the very top end—are protected so that they can exploit Australian workers. They want to keep wages low; it's part of their policy that has been clearly stated for the last decade and previous decades.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They've kept the same mantra: not doing anything, like making wages bigger and giving people an opportunity for minimum wage increases and to negotiate better work arrangements to make sure wages do increase. Nor, also, for those things that build better wages and improve skills, a very important initiative. It's because there's been a dead hand put on skills development in this country by those opposite. That's what they did for a decade: lost apprenticeships, lost skills and lost capacity. They couldn't turn around and even support our universities during the biggest crisis this country and this world have seen in over 100 years. What did they do? They drained off the Australian community and we all paid the price as a community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The 60 bills and these changes that we've made have made a difference, delivering the regional first home buyers guarantee—another important increase and improvement in arrangements. And there are cheaper medicines; these are fundamental things that support and give a basic chance to those who are struggling to deal with the cost-of-living pressures that exist in our community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Dealing with and containing prices, like reducing the pressure on prices for electricity and gas, was something they voted against because they didn't like the idea that the market would get regulated. Actually, what they didn't like was that their mates were going to be regulated—the mates that turn around and support them were going to get regulated. That's the problem. They vote against workers' pay increases, they vote against the opportunity for workers to negotiate better arrangements with their employers across industries and they vote against containing electricity prices. What do they do? They vote against making sure that cost-of-living initiatives are put into this economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To hear their list of questions about fuel tax: these are the people who turned around and didn't even consult with the transport industry. It's six per cent of the Australian economy and plays a significant role in making sure that the Australian economy runs. Many in the industry are single-owner operators, small and medium-sized businesses. But those opposite turned around and got rid of the fuel tax credit system. As a result of that, the drivers were not able to get the fuel tax credit basis back as a result of the pricing put forward by clients within the industry. When they took their complaints and problems up to Frydenberg and Morrison at the time, there was no answer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, the industry players—the Transport Workers Union, which of course is the largest small-business road transport organisation and probably the largest small business organisation in this country by numbers; the Australian road transport organisation, an employer group representing small, medium and large operators; the National Road Freighters Association, a group of well-meaning owner-drivers who do largely long-distance work and of course, NatRoad, the national road transport association—all said quite clearly that what the previous government did was strangle road transport, and without consultation. No matter how they much pleaded with Frydenberg, Morrison and those opposite, there wasn't a voice lifted,</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Nor was a voice lifted by Senator McKenzie in support of those people in this chamber. We raised it on a number of occasions and there was dead silence on the opposite side. They did not support the transport industry. That industry called out to the now government, the Albanese government, and asked for support. It said, 'We need this to be fixed,' and it was fixed. It was fixed! That's because we listened to what that industry was saying. That fuel tax credit system has been put back into place.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Nationals Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:14</span>):  I've only been here a short time, and something I've learned quickly is that governing is hard. Most of the people here come with great intentions; they're good people and they're here to make a better Australia. It's impossible to get everything right, but when the game's on the line champions want the ball. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government has been in office for nine months. That's enough for people who overly celebrated Labor's win or for coalition supporters who sought solace in the arms of others, to be decorating nurseries or planning deliveries of something else. But we still get, 'Everything bad is by the previous government,' and that everything good is by them. You can't take credit for things if you don't take responsibility for things. We've heard that 60 bills have passed, but they haven't addressed the problems that face us now. It's a very narcissistic trait, to project faults upon others. It's a very narcissistic trait not to take ownership of your own situations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We can stand here and say that wages are up, and they are. I'm not going to sit here and play points that they aren't. But real wages are not. That was a question we had today: 'How are people going, out there in the world?' As a group of people, I know we all have Australians' interests at heart and it's time for honesty on these things. What can we do about them? So we look here and watch where the actions aren't matching the intentions; they're not matching the words. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our first question today was talking about data and security of the nation. We were talking about cameras. We were talking about these things. I woke up and saw this news article about Hikvision and Dahua devices out there. This is an interesting story. I then had a very personal self-reflection. About three weeks ago I had a number of Hikvision security cameras installed on my house, and I realise that Senator Paterson's story will cost me about $5,000 to rectify. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We heard how these cameras were installed under our watch and it's our problem. But that ignores the fact that in November last year the United Kingdom and the United States identified that this was a problem. They announced that this was a problem. They announced that these were being withdrawn from use within their government buildings. Surely, the government of the time should have seen that and said, 'Let's have a look at it in Australia.' 'Let's see what is going on here with that problem.' But we didn't. Governing is hard. There are millions of moving pieces. I've never seen a more complex thing in my life. That is the ownership champions take: 'I have seen this. This has happened. I will do something.' </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians have been through too much. Since 2020 we have been locked down, we've been told what to put in our bodies, where to go, where not to go, everything like that. It is time for these people to have a life, to do things they enjoy, and for us to take the responsibility of having the ball, driving the game and winning the game for them. We shouldn't make them fear every little thing—everything about their wages, every bill, every mortgage payment, everything about climate change, the world's going to end, the Chinese are spying, my car's going to kill me. All of this as a parliament we are putting on them to scare them, to put fear in them, to manipulate them, and that is a thing that we should be taking on. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We talk about ownership. We had the question about the diesel fuel rebate today. I, for one, would like to thank the government for clearing that up and giving clarity that that will not be changed. There is no hatred or anger on these things. When good decisions are made they should be celebrated as much as pointing out the bad ones, because there are farmers out near Moree, up near Tamworth, who are planning on spending hundreds of thousands of dollars each—millions of dollars, in some cases—to plant crops. They will sit there and look at the cost of diesel, the cost of seed, the cost of fertiliser, the massive amount of money families will put out on a hope that it doesn't flood, that it doesn't drought, that it doesn't pesticide, that it doesn't mice plague. That is some certainty that you have given today, so thank you for that. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also ask, on all these other points, on real wages, on security, if we are to be a government and a parliament that cares about our people, let us take that on, let us act with maturity and let us give the people a break they deserve. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="300707" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator PAYMAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:19</span>):  My good friend over there, Senator Cadell—we started in the Senate together and did Senate school together—has made a very important point, which is that it is impossible to get everything right. You would imagine that people in government for almost a decade would at least get close to getting things right, but no. So that's the reason we're having this debate. It was very interesting to see the other side pretend to care when the question came up earlier about why the minister for the environment closed the Central Queensland coalmine. We're getting attacked for that as though we don't care about the environment, or, as Senator O'Sullivan pointed out, we're all talk but no action. But let me be clear. After a decade of no action promoting renewable energy, which the other side clearly failed miserably at, it's really interesting to see how they react when they see a responsible minister for the environment in Tanya Plibersek, who is taking action to close the mine.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This may be the first time that a decision like this has been made in 22 years. This decision was made on the premise of the mine having unacceptable impacts on the Great Barrier Reef, which is responsible for about $6 billion worth of economic activity every year and 64,000 jobs. We're talking about job security. We're talking about creating more jobs for Australians out there. There's Clive Palmer, who wants to challenge this decision. It is really shocking to know that those on the other side are questioning this or are quite confused about why the minister would make such an important decision.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm proud of being part of a government that puts priority on the environment, because, when we went to the election, we heard each and every person in Western Australia and across Australia tell us how important it is to save the environment, to prioritise it and to put it on the agenda as a matter of importance. At the end of the day, what are we fighting for here if we don't have a planet to live on?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For those on the other side, just for a piece of clarity, that was an export-only mine. It wouldn't be producing any coal for our energy grid. After attempting all those policies during their time—22 attempts, according to the record—there was a zero success rate. So they couldn't even land an energy policy. If they really cared about the energy policy, why did they vote against us when we went brought to this chamber the goal to reduce emissions by 2030 and have a reduction target of 43 per cent? Why didn't they support us?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In light of all this talk of being mature, responsible, open and transparent, that's what this Albanese Labor government has been indicating from the day we were elected. We're sick and tired of the delay, denial and destruction we've seen. Australians want to see action, and action is what they're seeing with this government. We need to bring to people's attention that the government's policies are very clear. We've been honest with the Australian people. We've indicated how much bad policies have impacted the time that we're in government now and all the mess that we need to clean up.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Aside from the emissions reduction target and ensuring that we have a clear path to net zero by 2050, we've also committed to the policies of $20 billion for Rewiring the Nation, $3 billion for the National Reconstruction Fund for renewables and low-emission technologies, stronger laws to protect the ozone layer and signing the Global Methane Pledge. These are things that are important to everyday Australians. If those opposite really care, they should talk their constituents and listen to them. Even if you are on the other side, you are still part of this parliament and you need to listen. Perhaps then you would get a clearer understanding of what they're trying to say to you.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator COLBECK</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:24</span>):  Over eight months, Australians have seen that the Labor they voted for is not the Labor that is governing. We see continued efforts by Labor to deflect answers at question time. It doesn't want to answer the question. It doesn't want to take responsibility for anything that it has done. It clearly doesn't want to take responsibility for its broken promises.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Birmingham asked a very legitimate question, given that during the lead-up to the election the then Opposition Leader and now Prime Minister made a promise that he wanted to see real wages continuing to increase. Australians have seen in eight short months that this is not going to happen, and there's now an admission by the government that it won't happen. It's just like the promise Labor made for the $275-a-year reduction in energy prices, which now will not pass the lips of any Labor member of parliament. That promise is gone. The empty and broken promises are now starting to pile up. In eight short months the broken promises are starting to pile up. I don't know how many times I heard Mr Albanese saying that he had a plan for the economy. It is becoming increasingly apparent that he has no plan for the economy, because every time something goes wrong, he says, 'We have to go out and talk to people.' He said he had a plan—there is no plan there to implement. There's absolutely no plan to implement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As has been said earlier, cheaper child care is an important thing for the Australian economy, but not everyone has children and not everyone is reaping the benefit of that. But they are reaping the problem of increasing energy prices. I have to say, what we're looking forward to, what has been predicted out of the gas markets, for example—is a continuing increase in the price of gas. Because there will be less gas because of the intervention of the Labor Party. Only the Labor Party could spend a billion-and-a-half dollars to put gas prices up when they promised to bring them down. Only the Labor party could do that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're seeing the same things starting to emerge. It's the same old Labor: deflect the problem, use cute language, blame somebody else, blame the previous government, never take responsibility for anything that you've done yourself and, of course, when the questions get really hard descend into personal abuse. Start hurling abuse across the chamber. We see that so many times. How does that work in a post-Jenkins world in this place? It's not conducive to that sort of respect that the prime minister promised—a kinder parliament. Wasn't there a memo that went out? Was the Prime Minister the only one that got the memo? Did the other ministers in his government get the memo? They don't seem to be following it. Or is it just when someone's asking the Prime Minister a question that the memo applies? I reckon that's the case. Don't ask the Prime Minister any hard questions. Don't ask him about him keeping his promises: wages going up higher than inflation; cheaper power prices.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All we're seeing is the same old Labor. We all know—particularly those of us on this side—that Labor can't manage the economy. We've seen it time after time. We remember the pink batts. We remember the school halls. We remember the extraordinary spending that went on during the global financial crisis. We remember that Labor wanted us to spend $6 billion asking Australians to get vaccinated when all we had to do was to give them a good reason to get vaccinated—and they did, they turned out in their droves.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Here we have the same old Labor re-emerging, and it's mostly the same people from 2007-13. It's mostly the same people, and we're going to get the same results. We know that Labor can't handle the economy. They'll try to blame everybody else, they'll try to deflect, they'll try to abuse and they'll try to put it off on to someone else. But Labor we know. In 6,000 words we found out: they want to take economic policy back to the 1970s. They want to undo the reforms of Hawke and Keating that were so important in the last 30 years of economic prosperity in this country. It is the same old Labor. We shouldn't forget that. They won't keep their promises, they won't take responsibility for that and they won't own up.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">At a time when Australians are labouring under a cost-of-living crisis, at a time when food prices, petrol prices, medicine prices, transport prices, rents, mortgages, electricity prices and insurance payments are all sky rocketing, it is a massive injustice that this government is even considering going ahead with quarter of a trillion dollars worth of tax cuts for the super wealthy. Even the International Monetary Fund, one of the absolute architects and cheerleaders of neoliberalism around the planet, has suggested that these tax cuts should be reassessed, yet this government, in its blind pursuit of lining the pockets of the already very wealthy people in this country, is ignoring the cries of working-class people who are struggling to make ends meet.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">These stage 3 tax cuts used to be Mr Morrison's tax cuts. He conceived of them when he was Treasurer and he legislated for them when he was Prime Minister. But these are no longer Mr Morrison's tax cuts; these stage 3 tax cuts for the super wealthy are now Labor's tax cuts because Labor brought down a budget after the election that included these tax cuts and Labor have confirmed, as recently as Senator Gallagher's answer to my questions this afternoon, that these tax cuts are still Labor's policy.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The important thing to know is that Labor has never been able to run an argument that these tax cuts are good policy, and of course that's because Labor knows they're not good policy. So why does Labor support them? Because in their own self-interest they decided prior to the election that they had to support them. Labor's position boils down to this: they're going to support policy that they know is wrong and they're doing it because they promised to do something that they knew was wrong.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're in the middle of an inflation spike in this country at the moment, with the RBA basically going rogue, using a sledgehammer to crack a walnut, trying to use old style interest rate rises, which work well when it's a demand side-driven price spiral but don't work when it's a supply-side price spiral, which is what we're in now. The reason the RBA feels it has to do that is because Dr Chalmers, the Treasurer, has abandoned the field. He's run for cover. He won't use the powers that he's got in the Reserve Bank Act to actually override the RBA on interest rates. He won't pull any of the massive taxation levers he's got at his disposal.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When you consider Labor's political cowardice on the stage 3 tax cuts with Dr Chalmers's cowardice in refusing to implement anti-inflationary tax policy and refusing to use the power that he has to override the RBA, we're left with a situation now where we're going to get super inflationary stage 3 tax cuts, a quarter of a trillion dollars of pump priming the economy, in the most inflationary way conceivable at a time when they come into play when, according to the Reserve Bank, inflation will still be above the target band. The Treasurer says Labor's got a plan for inflation. It is inconceivable that that plan includes putting $9,000 a year into the pockets of billionaires. These are Labor's tax cuts. They have to own them, and they should walk away from them.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HZB" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BILYK</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:40</span>):  I rise to speak to document 4, the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity's annual report 2021-22. The Joint Committee on the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity, of which I am chair and of which Senator Scarr has previously been chair—and I thank him for his support through all that time—has the statutory right to examine each annual report prepared by the integrity commissioner under the Law Enforcement Integrity Commissioner Act 2006. As part of this examination, the committee held a public hearing yesterday to speak with ACLEI about its performance over the reporting period. While the committee will table a report in due course—and I do not wish to pre-empt that report—I do wish to note some highlights from the report and the hearing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Providing context for the annual report, the committee heard from the Integrity Commissioner that 2021-22 was a year of further maturing and development for ACLEI. The work undertaken in 2021 to bring the five new agencies into ACLEI's jurisdiction—that is, the ATO, ACCC, ASIC, APRA and the Office of the Special Investigator—was embedded. The year ended with ACLEI's first prosecution before the courts of corruption offences involving an ATO officer in Operation Barker, which was a significant bribery investigation. During the year, the first biannual stakeholder survey was conducted of jurisdictional agencies, with pleasing results, showing an overall satisfaction rate of 89 per cent. Areas for improvement include timelines such as the triage of ACLEI's assessment work. The committee heard that a major focus for the reporting period was recruitment, and it currently has 112 staff. ACLEI now has a deputy commissioner, as recommended by the parliamentary committee, and opened an office in Melbourne during the reporting period.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The hearing also canvassed topical issues such as preparation for the establishment of the National Anti-Corruption Commission, or the NACC. The Integrity Commissioner told the committee that ACLEI has three key priorities for the remainder of its time as ACLEI: to complete the legislative requirements for ACLEI; to finish ACLEI well, meaning ACLEI is in the fortunate position of knowing it is coming to an end and will take opportunities over the next few months to celebrate what ACLEI has achieved; and to work with the Attorney-General's Department on the establishment of the NACC. The work with the Attorney-General's Department has involved: dedicating one of their senior lawyers to work with the AGD on the drafting of the legislation; leading a project with the department to build a new ICT platform for the NACC; undertaking property projects for new leases for the NACC; building an intake and assessment process capable of dealing with the number of matters that might come to the NACC; engaging in an organisational design process; and continued recruitment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the hearing, the committee thanked the Integrity Commissioner and staff for their work over the reporting period, particularly for their work in relation to the establishment of the NACC. I add my personal thanks to the commissioner and staff for a job well done. Their work on the transition to the NACC in particular will help ensure that the Australian government delivers on our promise that by the middle of this year Australians will have a powerful, independent and transparent anticorruption commission with the powers of a standing royal commission, able to investigate serious or systemic corrupt conduct across the entire federal Public Service.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While the NACC is an important reform for returning integrity and trust to parliament after numerous scandals, I acknowledge that ACLEI has done an exceptional job within the bounds of its jurisdiction. It has served Australia well, including during my time as chair and deputy chair of the ACLEI committee—about 14 years overall—and I consider it a privilege to have witnessed their work from the perspective of a committee member. I look forward to the opportunity to make another contribution on the report of the inquiry when it is tabled, and I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

Finally, I wanted to put on the record my personal appreciation of Senator Bilyk, who I think has performed an outstanding role over many years as both deputy chair and chair of the ACLEI oversight committee. I'll add a personal touch to that and thank Senator Bilyk for inviting me for a cup of coffee and conveying her wisdom to me after I first became chair and for her very civil and collegiate sense of assistance that she gave me throughout my period as chair, which I think is in the best traditions of this place. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to comment on the foot-and-mouth outbreak in Indonesia and just how scary that could have been. I want to share my thoughts with the Senate because I've just returned from Indonesia and our committee is going up to Indonesia in a couple of months to talk about the scariness of lumpy skin disease and foot-and-mouth even more.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to let fellow Senators know that it was in May last year, I think, when the outbreak in Indonesia was first reported. I think the first case came out in about April. Since then, colleagues, I'm pleased to say that, since that first reported outbreak in May 2022, the disease has been detected in 27 of Indonesia's 37 provinces. Well, I'm not pleased to say that; that's quite alarming. But, as of 11 am on 9 February, the Indonesian government has reported a total of no less than 599,822 foot-and-mouth cases in Indonesia alone. So Indonesia is reporting that 11,849,455 doses of foot-and-mouth disease vaccine have been used, and it's great to say that Australia has been a significant contributor to that. I'm glad to hear that infections are predominantly in the western islands of Sumatra and Java. The highest number of infections have been reported in the provinces of East Java, West Nusa Tenggara, West Java and Central Java.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia has strong existing requirements in place for foot-and-mouth disease preparedness, and we have been on our toes with this for many, many years because we do know the damage that this could do to our $80 billion beef and meat industry. Since the outbreak in Indonesia, we've strengthened our response at the borders, enhanced our collaboration with states and territories and provided support to Indonesia. The Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee has been investigating this as well, when a reference was put through the chamber here. All members of the committee were very keen to roll our sleeves up, get together and start working on this to see just how vulnerable we could be and ask what things we needed to be absolutely clear on and what issues have to be taken to task to make sure that this dreaded disease does not get into our country. It's no secret here that once it's in we can't stop it. That's before we start talking about feral pig numbers and all sorts of things out there like camels—we have no idea.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian government has recently committed to long-term sustainable funding for biosecurity through new investments worth $134 million, which will bolster Australia's strongest ever response to this terrible threat. Following the first reports of lumpy skin disease and foot-and-mouth disease in Indonesia, border control measures were immediately enhanced and all risk pathways were reviewed. I know there was a lot of scaremongering out there. I have to say that it is great to be part of a government that moved quickly. Minister Watt was in very close consultation with the industry. He led the charge. They worked hand in hand. I can't find an agriculture or biosecurity representative body which hasn't had anything but good to say about Minister Watt's magnificent response and about the department and this government working closely to make sure that we do everything we can to mitigate any outbreak in this nation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">After the official confirmation from Indonesian authorities that foot-and-mouth disease had spread to Bali in July last year, the department implemented additional measures to further strengthen the border and protect Australia from foot-and-mouth disease. This is due, as we all know, to the high number of people who travel between Bali and Australia. I think the latest count was some 30,000 a week. It's great to see Bali back open for business and it's great to see Australians pouring into our favourite island. As a Western Aussie, I'm a real Bali tragic. I was so rapt that this year, after a three-year hiatus, I was able to get back to Bali.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If I may digress, it was just fantastic to see the joy on the Balinese people's faces now that tourism has returned to that island, to the island of the Gods. It's not at the point that it's going to save a lot of families. Those who regularly travel to Bali know only too well the terrible impact that the pandemic has had on those beautiful people. Unlike here in Australia, there is no free health care. It sickens me when I hear Australians whinge about our health system and refer to our health system as a Third World health system. They need to get off their backsides and see what's happening just over the other side of the Arafura Sea.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are back with our Balinese friends again. They are so grateful to see Aussies back again. They are so grateful to have the opportunity—and I was talking to some people the other day—to get their $3-a-day wage. When I see Aussies trying to barter down Balinese for a lousy singlet, it makes me feel even more embarrassed. Anyway, I digressed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is so important that we work closely with our Balinese friends and all our Indonesian friends. Biosecurity response zones were established at all first point of entry for vessels and at all international airports that receive direct flights from Indonesia. The response zones enable additional powers to be exercised by biosecurity officers at the border, including the ability to direct arriving travellers to walk over sanitation foot mats. These mats are deployed for all arrivals of aircraft and cruise vessels from Indonesia. Since July 2022 over 800,000 arriving travellers have walked over them. I and my mates walked over them the other night, and it's no big deal. It's something as simple as a saturation mat. It doesn't even get the top of your thongs wet, which is an even bigger plus. These sanitation footbaths are also in use for commercial vessels arriving from Indonesia when crew disembark at Australian ports. I congratulate the minister and his department. They've got that covered brilliantly as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Biosecurity officers are boarding all aircraft arriving from Indonesia to make an announcement about the foot-and-mouth disease risk and remind travellers of their obligations to declare any risky goods they are carrying, including soiled footwear, when entering Australia. That's not just a reading point; it's what I actually witnessed when I arrived back in Australia on Friday night. It was great to see.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Intervention at international airports has increased. Those who have had the pleasure of sitting through Senate rural, regional affairs and transport estimates have heard me bleat about this. A lot of us sit there on a Sunday night and watch <span style="font-style:italic;">Border</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">Security</span>. We all sit with our fist in our mouth thinking: 'How the hell do they get away with this? How the hell can people come into this country and not declare stuff?' They hide food in their pockets and they wrap food in their clothes in their suitcases. There are paltry fines. I'm very pleased to say—and this came out of Senate estimates in the last round, and we'll be going into Senate estimates again on Tuesday or Monday—that that's all old footage, thank goodness. Soon Channel 7 will get the new footage out and start showing that you don't get a slap on the wrist when you try to import 17 kilograms of raw pork into this nation, like we've seen on telly. A young Spanish fellow—and I'm not sure which airport it was; it could have been Perth for all I know—tried to sneak stuff into the country a couple of weeks ago. He thought he was clever in not declaring some things he had in his suitcase, including raw pork. He said it was prosciutto, they tell me. I'm happy to say that, not only did he get turned around and sent straight back out, but he copped a $3,300 fine. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm happy to say I can't wait to see the new series of <span style="font-style:italic;">Border Security </span>on Channel Seven, because then I don't have to put up with my mates at the golf club calling me everything under the sun for letting these people sneak in with all this food and whatnot. I've even seen buffalo penises dried out for food, I kid you not. So that's a bright note!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But seriously, the threat to this nation and our great meat industry, is very serious. It's not very often that I congratulate governments—I'm well known for that—but we've moved so quickly. Minister Watt, you've done a magnificent job, and it gives me a lift under my wings when I sit with representatives from biosecurity and the agricultural and horticultural industries here in Australia, who sing as one how fantastic it's been to be able to sit down, work with government, get serious and not play stupid, petty politics that you would expect at a university fight club or drink club—or whatever they do at university; I don't know—on a Friday night. Well done, Minister Watt. Well done, Australia. It's great to work together with the industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In saying that, as I said before very clearly, we must do whatever we can not only to keep this disease out of Australia but also to support our very dear friends in Indonesia, who I can tell you now really do value the support that comes from Australia.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:56</span>):  I lend my support to most of Senator Sterle's comments, having also been on the inquiry into the biosecurity measures. Hopefully, the Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee will be visiting Indonesia at some stage in the first half of this year to follow up on measures in place up there in relation to foot-and-mouth disease.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to make a short contribution on the other side of this inquiry and this information, which was about an incursion of varroa mite, in particular <span style="font-style:italic;">Varroa</span><span style="font-style:italic;">destructor</span>, into Australia. Varroa mite is the most serious global threat to European honey bees and poses a very serious threat now in Australia. Although we have detected varroa mite previously in European honey bees at ports, we've never had a known outbreak in this country. Sadly, in the last 18 months, that's exactly what has happened. Having sat on a number of Senate rural and regional affairs inquiries into the honey industry in the last decade, they have always been concerned about an outbreak of varroa mite, and it's happened. It's here. We travelled around the country taking evidence on this, and we have never seen a response in this country like the one that's being run through the New South Wales DPI and the federal government in a joint declaration of an emergency to try to contain and ultimately eradicate varroa mite.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to say today that we did hear from some witnesses—in Newcastle, for example—who were experienced beekeepers and industry advocates and who said they don't believe it is possible to eradicate varroa mite in this country now that it's here, but the New South Wales department and the federal department are still confident we can eradicate varroa mite. I certainly hope that is the case. We hadn't heard much news, which was good news, until just a few days ago, when new cases were recorded in the red zones around Newcastle. It may be a function of more surveillance and more work being done and, hence, more infestations of these mites being found, or it could be that there are new vectors and that it is spreading. Either way, this battle against this most serious of biosecurity breaches will continue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens are pleased to have been on this inquiry. We asked that varroa mite be included in the terms of reference for this inquiry. Originally, this inquiry was going to be just on foot-and-mouth disease, and then it was on lumpy skin disease also, and we asked if we could also include varroa mite. I know that there are many people in the bee industry who are still concerned. Whether they offer pollination services or are in the honey part of the industry, they're very concerned about a nationally coordinated program to stop the spread of varroa mite. For example, bees are now allowed to be transported and used across borders, when the eradication or containment lines are still being resourced and we haven't actually managed to eradicate this pest.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So there's more work to do, we must be vigilant and we'll certainly look forward to following up any updates at Senate estimates next week.</span>

As you've heard from the two previous speakers, we have got two major threats on our doorstep, and, as Senator Whish-Wilson indicated, we also now have varroa mite in New South Wales. This is a situation that has never happened in Australia before, and it certainly has tested everyone who has been affected, both in prevention and, as has been discussed, in attempting to eradicate varroa mite.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The biosecurity inquiry that I was privileged to be a member of was really a great opportunity for many, many organisations to contribute submissions and take time to come to hearings. Many of those organisations, particularly in the bee industry, have a volunteer base, with no full-time staff, but they wholeheartedly contributed to the process. Even some larger organisations only had one full-time employee. But, without a shadow of a doubt, the contributions were thoughtful and considered, and everyone involved took the inquiry extremely seriously because, as we all know, biosecurity matters. It matters to the value and quality of our agricultural products, which we rely on for a whole range of things: for the economic windfall that comes from our exports, the livelihoods of people in rural and regional Australia, food security, and our international reputation and standing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to join previous speakers in commending Minister Watt and the Prime Minister, who acted extremely swiftly in this space to do all that our country could do to implement measures to protect our borders from the threat of FMD and lumpy skin disease. I saw firsthand their work ethic, their dedication and the rapid pace they worked at to make our borders safe and to activate the industries that are so vital to Australia. It's worth remembering that, because of this quick action, our country remains free of foot-and-mouth disease and lumpy skin disease, as our Senate report notes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is also, I think, incredibly important to understand the hand that was extended to our neighbours, as Senator Sterle has mentioned, to help them in their fight, because lumpy skin disease in particular but also FMD are such threats to our neighbours' agricultural industries. Not only is it in our interest, because we want to have strong borders, but it is our duty to assist them, which this government has been doing. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to give an example of what I saw firsthand when I travelled recently to Tatura, which is in dairy country in Victoria. I had the privilege, on behalf of the minister, to address people on these issues during International Dairy Week. I will say that agriculture is not my strong suit, but I was extremely privileged to speak to a very large room full of farmers, breeders and processors about what we're doing in biosecurity and what the report said. This group takes biosecurity extremely seriously. Under the auspices of their peak body, they have convened a range of education opportunities for their members. They have also put a thoughtful, considered and consultative submission into this inquiry. They talk to their industry and they're currently mobilising their industry to ensure they do everything possible to have the best biosecurity strategy possible in that industry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Talking about the best biosecurity strategies: Minister Watt released the National Biosecurity Strategy last August, and it is the nation's first such strategy. It charts the next 10 years of Australia's biosecurity policy development and, importantly, it bears the signature of every state and territory agriculture minister. That's what we saw at this inquiry: unity of purpose and absolute determination to bring biosecurity to the forefront in our industries. This strategy recognises that our biosecurity system is larger than the sum of its parts, and that our federation requires Commonwealth leadership and better collaboration between state and territory governments in this area of complex policy. However, the Senate committee report also acknowledges that threats to biosecurity are persistent and that it's impossible to operate in a risk-free environment when it comes to biosecurity. We know we must be prepared for threats to emerge, not just as isolated events but presenting themselves concurrently—as I described with the situation we faced last year. In that light, the Senate inquiry also heard evidence about where we need to do better: better cooperation; we need to reinvest in preparedness and detection capabilities; Animal Health Australia and Plant Health Australia need to broaden their consultations to include all stakeholder across the supply chain; and, importantly, we need a sustainable biosecurity funding model.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These recommendations did not fall on deaf ears. One of the strategies of the new Labor government is to approach our nation's policy challenges with an eye to the long term. For industries which face such significant biosecurity threats, this means committing to sustainable funding which will guarantee the ongoing protection of our agriculture sector. Finding a funding model that works and is sustainable is something the government takes seriously and is committed to. That's why the centrepiece of our agriculture budget was an investment of $134.1 million to bolster Australia's biosecurity system, including livestock traceability, frontline preparedness, and measures like detector-dog handlers and funding for Animal Health Australia. This is a substantial down payment on the election commitment to fund biosecurity properly and sustainably in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We will all reap the benefits of a strong biosecurity system, and that system is only as strong as its weakest link—or its most confused state border: New South Wales bees fly over the border, not realising that there is one, unfortunately! Taken together, the Senate biosecurity inquiry report and the National Biosecurity Strategy set out a strong manifesto for how the new Australian government intends to operate in the space of biosecurity and agriculture. The 29 recommendations made in the Senate biosecurity inquiry report, which I personally support, are currently being considered by the government, and the six priority areas to achieve greater cooperation and preparedness laid out in the national strategy echo the tone of these recommendations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Good policy is the result of listening. To that end, the government will be consultative, partnering with industry, the community and state and territory governments to make sure the harmful impact of threats are closely monitored, and to make sure we can develop a sustainable and forward-looking biosecurity policy for the agricultural sector. I'm a new senator, and agriculture and biosecurity are not my strong suit, but I valued the immense opportunity to learn firsthand from the experts who we saw and the industry people who live with this threat on a daily basis. It was a privilege. It caused me to think about issues that I know nothing about, but I also saw firsthand the vital industries that are the backbone of Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Biosecurity is everybody's issue. It's important that people read this report and also talk to those people in the industry. I know that Minister Watt will continue to do that. I look forward to having the opportunity again to work with great colleagues on this RRAT committee. It was entertaining, interesting and incredibly important. I thank the Senate. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:11</span>):  The COVID-19 pandemic has brought the importance of telehealth services into sharp focus. As we as a community continue to navigate through the pandemic it is clear that expanding telehealth services must be a priority in our efforts to rebuild a stronger and more resilient health system. Telehealth is a game changer for so many people. It enables people in regional areas to access health care that would otherwise be out of reach. Telehealth removes so many barriers for disabled people to access health care. It enables many members of our community to seek out medical supports in their lunchbreaks without, for instance, having to lose a day's wages for a short GP appointment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've been hearing very clearly from the community in relation to the future of telehealth. This report, which shares the findings of the Auditor-General's inspection of the expansion of telehealth services during the pandemic, highlights the work that still needs to be done to maximise the positive benefits and impacts that telehealth can provide. For a telehealth system that best services our community, we must ensure that there is a continual focus on listening to feedback from the community using the service and on implementing change when required. This report tells us that no First Nations organisations were involved in meetings where telehealth policy settings were discussed—a massive oversight. We cannot expect to have a culturally relevant or appropriate platform for as long as this remains the case.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Additionally, the Department of Health and Aged Care did not establish performance measures for telehealth expansion. Instead, it assumed that the usage and billing behaviours were sufficient indicators of success. Usage measures do not tell us anything, for instance, about the quality of care received. We could have been measuring if a person felt that their needs were met by the consultation, how easy it was to access telehealth services or the broader benefits received by the individual and community by being able to access health care in this way. It just highlights how much more effective community services are when they are co-designed by those who are affected by and utilise those services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have an opportunity, moving forward, to strengthen what could be a truly transformational service, to make it accessible and relevant to everyone in this country and to make sure that we as a community have a way of collectively measuring the success of this service in a way that is genuinely meaningful and helpful.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government must commit to ongoing support and development of the telehealth service and the implementation of these recommendations more broadly, because every single person in this country deserves to have access to high-quality health care.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This afternoon the Deputy Prime Minister made a statement in the House about Australia's sovereignty principles. I commend the statement. In the proper tradition of those kinds of statements being made, it is, indeed, a statement of the government's position, but it's also an opportunity to consider and reflect upon these issues. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sovereignty, if it has any meaning in in this context, is about the capacity of Australia and Australians to shape our own future and not allow others to shape it for us. The Deputy Prime Minister's speech outlined the situation that Australia is in: a clear-eyed view of the world as it is, not as we would hope it to be. Indeed, our strategic circumstances in the region and at the global level are very complex and challenging indeed. The world that Australia confronts, and the region that we confront today, is the most challenging since World War II. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We no longer live in a benign environment. Complacency is no longer viable. That's why Australia must have a clear conversation, a clear doctrine, about our approach to sovereignty. But we must also work in tandem with like-minded countries and partners who share our democratic values and our aspiration for, in particular in the region, a sense of regional independence, sovereignty and self-determination. That can only be managed through robust policy frameworks and principles that maintain and protect our sovereignty, and today's statement by the Deputy Prime Minister is an important juncture in this approach. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Clarification of the framework is helpful. It's helpful to me in the work that I do in the two junior portfolios I have, in terms of trade and manufacturing. Those principles do inform that work. Minister Farrell again set out today in question time his approach: diversifying our markets, diversifying our products and leaning in hard to multilateralism and functional trading rules around the world. It matters also for our approach to issues like rebuilding industry capability in my own area of manufacturing. It's not just an economic prospect; industry capability is core to any meaningful approach to national sovereignty. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A number of principles were set out by the Deputy Prime Minister. Alliances matter—alliances with partners who share in an enduring way our interests and values and are prepared to take collective action to protect those interests and values. The Albanese government will of course continue to work with our US ally and our key partners to advance our interests, because, as the Deputy Prime Minister stated:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… our sovereignty is stronger when we work with others towards shared goals, in ways that respect each other's national interests.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… it is more important than ever that we work with the countries of the region to continue to reduce tensions and maintain the peace and security that has underpinned economic prosperity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And like in the United States, where President Biden has begun the process of revitalising American manufacturing, so too will Australia. In the United States, President Biden, through the CHIPS act and the Inflation Reduction Act, together with House and Senate Republicans and Democrats alike, has grasped that industrial capability, sovereignty, national security and democratic cohesion are all interrelated and require renewal. The Albanese government's package of reforms in my portfolio area of manufacturing speaks to the same vital objectives that are mobilising American institutions, workers and their unions, firms and financial institutions. The US industrial revival is gathering steam.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government's National Reconstruction Fund is our opportunity to shape our own industrial future. It is modern, it is mission focused and it is utterly relevant to the sectors critical to our national future, to our future national development and to our national security. Our friends, partners and others in the region are watching to see whether we grasp this national moment for industrial capability and manufacturing revival. There are very significant opportunities in the region—in security terms, climate and energy terms, food security terms and manufacturing terms—to have a shared approach to achieving these objectives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a mystery to me why some people in this place oppose these objectives or, even worse, refuse to engage with them. They abrogate their national responsibility. The National Reconstruction Fund is an economic measure, yes, but it is a national security measure too, consistent with any sensible conception of what our national interest is. Australia's future industrial capability is too important to play politics with. We have to put headway over headlines, and substance before slogans. If President Biden in the fractured, polarised world of Washington politics can unite Republicans and Democrats around these objectives, surely we can do better in this place and back the National Reconstruction Fund.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence said in his ministerial statement, Australia's frontline will always be diplomacy. He said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Our primary effort is to use our diplomacy to reduce tensions and create pathways for peace.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, our international security and our shared sense of a global, peaceful future is undermined by those who seek to resolve disputes by power and size rather than by international rules and norms. Russia's illegal and unjustified invasion of Ukraine and its nuclear brinkmanship are a salutary example of this. We remain deeply committed in Australia to working constructively with our partners, notwithstanding our occasional differences—our inevitable differences as sovereign nations—to make the world safe, peaceful and ultimately more prosperous.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's vital, of course, that the Australian public and the parliament have confidence that, when enhancing our defence capability, we never trade away our sovereignty. As the Deputy Prime Minister said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… we will not trade sovereignty for capability. To do so would be illusory. For the only point of increased capability is to strengthen sovereignty.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I say to the Senate that it is well worthwhile reading the statement and considering what it means for our approach here. Our capacity to shape our own future, to pursue the policy objectives that we might differ upon in this place, is going to be very much determined by how we approach these questions of sovereignty and national security in the coming decades and how we lay the foundation for a strong, stable, credible Australian approach to these issues. Enhanced diplomacy, intelligence, economic statecraft, development assistance, trade, democratic resilience and our approach on questions like foreign interference are core to our capacity to keep Australians safe, maintain our national sovereignty and pursue the policy objectives that we think are relevant.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll just say in closing that I did see in the last parliament a recklessness about the consequences of hyperpoliticisation of some of these issues and some crass partisan politics undermining the core national asset we as Australians have of bipartisanship on these national security questions. I hope that colleagues in this place and the other place have reflected upon the consequences of hyperpartisanship and undermining that bipartisan national asset. It does damage the national interest. I hope that reflection has caused a fresh approach and that people are seized on these issues with the same sense of mission and urgency that the Albanese Labor government is.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="250156" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator STEELE-JOHN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:26</span>):  In contributing to this debate today in relation and response to the Deputy Prime Minister's and the defence minister's statement in relation to AUKUS, it has been fascinating to read through this ministerial statement in the current context. What we have here is one of the most tortured political statements I have read in a very, very long time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian community more broadly were absolutely stunned by the announcement in the dying days of the former government of this so-called AUKUS pact. We woke up one morning to a bunch of articles about us acquiring nuclear submarines and sections of a Zoom facilitated press conference with President Biden, the then UK Prime Minister, Boris Johnson, and Scott Morrison on TV. Most of the community spent about a day hearing about this term—'AUKUS, AUKUS, AUKUS'—and then that was it. The mainstream media coverage ceased at: What would we be getting? What kind of submarine would it be? What kind of capability would it have? Left totally unexamined was why these three men had taken that particular moment to introduce the idea onto the global stage. Left unanalysed and unengaged with was the question of why these three people at this particular moment in time would take this opportunity to announce such a shared project.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, let's examine it a bit together. You had Scott Morrison, who knew in his heart of hearts that he was on the way to losing government, desperately trying to find a way to differentiate himself from an opposition that had decided that it would accept nearly anything that the Liberal government proposed in order to get back in power. You had President Biden, who had just endured week after week of scenes showing testament to the world of the absolute lack of judgement that has been displayed by the United States in the last 20 years in relation to foreign policy, global diplomacy and war. As its misguided intervention into Afghanistan came crashing down and we all watched those horrific scenes as Kabul Airport was evacuated, the weakness and the intellectual limitations of the United States were on display as never before. Then you had Boris Johnson, who, fresh from being foiled in his attempts to prorogue his own parliament, facing complete rebellion inside his own government, would have rather been on the frontlines in Kyiv than in the houses of parliament, facing his own colleagues.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And so these three men took the opportunity to try to change the conversation by making this announcement—something they had been cooking up in the background with their defence departments, which had purposefully been circumventing the State Department in the United States, the foreign affairs department of the Commonwealth of Australia and the foreign ministry of the United Kingdom. This has all been kept very, very close to the chest. All that was really given to the Australian people was: 'Hello everybody, we're going to develop a nuclear powered submarine in the face of decades of steadfast opposition by the Australian public to the nuclearisation of our waters. We're just going to do this now. We have no idea how we're going to achieve it and we have no idea how long it will take. We've got absolutely no idea how much it will cost—we'll figure that out. Just follow the shiny announcement over here.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we have seen in the more than 12 months since that statement is that the details of this agreement have not been ironed out and that the principal impact of such a shared project to bring into the world such a despicable weapon would be to fundamentally compromise the independence of Australia—our ability as a nation to make decisions in line with the Australian community's expectations. It's a baseline expectation of the Australian community that the government it elects will make decisions that reflect its interests. And yet here we have a project which would seek to bind us up with the United States for the next one, two or three decades in pursuit of a technology type with which we have no experience and no capability, and therefore must be wholly reliant on the United States and United Kingdom in that development process. This puts us completely in the power of two nations which, over the last two decades, have demonstrated some of the poorest decision-making in relation to war and foreign policy that has been seen since the Second World War.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This minister's statement references the United Nations charter and the absolute importance of upholding that charter, and of confronting nations when they violate it—particularly when they act in relation to wars of aggression. It rightly condemns Russia for doing so—as the Australian Greens have done on multiple occasions. The torture in this statement comes in when you realise the fact that this minister is making this speech less than a month out from the 20th anniversary of the United States violating that charter, and the Australian government joining with the United States in the violation of that charter, through the illegal and immoral invasion of the sovereign nation of Iraq. The irony in that almost beggars belief. Twenty years on, with Iraq still in ruins and with Afghanistan falling apart, this Labor government would ask the Australian people to put their faith in the United States, not only for the next 10 years, not only for the next 20, but for the next 30 or more years, gifting to them in the process multiple billions in public funds.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There will be some who say, 'They're just lending us a piece of technology; they've done that in the past.' To make such a statement is to demonstrate such a profound level of duplicity in this discussion as to be unworthy of this place. Every member on the Labor side, every member of this government, understands—truly, they understand—that this technology acquisition is fundamentally different. This is not a propeller. This is not a new version of troop carrier. This is a nuclear powered submarine, reliant on an industry we have purposely never developed in this country—a capability that we have actively chosen not to develop, because of the risk it poses to triggering an arms race in our region, the very region the minister says he seeks to stabilise. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In putting this forward, they suggest to us that we would be able to co-build this capability, having no ability to sustain it ourselves for decades and yet utilise it solely in our national interest. I ask you to consider whether that really sounds right. Do we really believe that the United States and United Kingdom would gift us the opportunity to use their shipyards to build boats for us if they believed that we would ever utilise them against their national interests, against their strategic objectives? Pull the other one.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Twenty years on from Iraq, in the aftermath of the collapse of Afghanistan, we must learn the lessons of this recent past. We must strike out on our own, we must have an independent and peaceful foreign policy. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="281503" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CICCONE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Government Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:36</span>):  I rise to take note of the ministerial statement of the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence given earlier today in the other place. In that statement, Deputy Prime Minister Marles outlined Australia's sovereignty principles and explained how cooperation with our friends and partners enables us to pursue our national interest and enhance that sovereignty. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The strategic circumstances that we find ourselves in are the most complex and challenging since the Second World War. It's hard to pick up a newspaper without reading about escalating tensions in our region or active conflict on the European continent. This is the backdrop against which the Deputy Prime Minister, the Minister for Defence, delivered this statement on sovereignty today and in the context of much discussion about the AUKUS agreement. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There has been some suggestion that the acquisition of nuclear propelled submarines through AUKUS would serve to undermine Australia's sovereignty—and we have just heard Senator Steele-John's contribution—because the development of this new capability for the Royal Australian Navy will come through cooperation with our strongest and closest allies, the United States of America and the United Kingdom. This suggestion that's been put, particularly by the Greens, is wrong. Those who make it fundamentally misunderstand sovereignty and the strategic environment in which we are living. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In these challenging times, it is more important than ever that Australia works closely with our friends, with other like-minded states, to secure our collective security. This is why we have the AUKUS arrangements. This cooperation is managed through robust policy frameworks and principles that maintain and protect our sovereignty, here in Australia, sovereignty that is at the heart of national security and Australia's way of life. Protecting this will always be the Albanese government's first priority. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia's front line will always be diplomacy. To quote the Deputy Prime Minister: 'Our primary effort is to use our diplomacy to reduce tensions and create pathways for peace.' But it is also prudent, in our uncertain strategic environment, to strengthen our defence capabilities, which are a key factor in maintaining our sovereignty. As the Deputy Prime Minister highlighted, while defence capability does not define sovereignty, having high-end capability ready to deploy at our complete discretion allows us to determine our own circumstances without coercion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The geopolitical challenges that we face, we do not face alone. We stand shoulder to shoulder with our allies and like-minded states. Indeed, cooperation with others is integral to protecting our sovereignty—not detrimental to it, as some have wrongly suggested. This suggestion by some that Australia should be isolationist in our development of defence capability ignores the very fact that our relationships with other states, in and of themselves, are an essential part of our capability. Measuring our ability to defend our nation is not as simple as adding up all the equipment and Defence Force personnel. We must also consider how our allies can assist us, should the worst ever happen, both in the development and the procurement of defence material and through direct cooperation in military operations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You only need to look at Ukraine at the moment to see this principle in action. Australia is one of the largest non-NATO contributors to defence against Russia's unprovoked illegal invasion of Ukraine. Therefore, Ukraine's relationship with Australia makes a direct contribution to the defence of Ukrainian sovereignty.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I was on board HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Canberra</span> last year—a vessel whose hull was made in Spain, whose combat system was developed in the United States and whose fit-out was completed here in Australia—I really appreciated how, along with all our allies, we can work together to improve each of our individual capabilities and therefore make significant contribution to our own national sovereignty.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To return to AUKUS specifically, the argument that nuclear propelled submarines acquired for the pact cannot contribute to sovereign capability, because we require support from our allies, ignores the fact that we are currently working in a collaborative manner on several defence and intelligence operations. Australia jointly operates three facilities with the United States: the Joint Defence Facility Pine Gap, the Joint Geological and Geophysical Research Station and the Learmonth Solar Observatory. Not only do these very important facilities provide critical functions that directly support our national security but, importantly, they also help to operate other facilities right around the world because they're all interconnected and help our allies and friends when they need assistance. Importantly, we could not operate these facilities in isolation. I think that is the point that some in this place seem to forget.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These collaborations with the United States facilitate intelligence cooperation and communications that help ensure that Australia and our Five Eyes partners maintain an intelligence advantage. The insights and intelligence gained through the Five Eyes partnership play a vital role in informing decisions that protect and strengthen our sovereignty, demonstrating once again that our strong international relationships are a vital asset. The Albanese government will continue to work with the US and our key partners to advance our interests because, as the Deputy Prime Minister stated, 'Our sovereignty is stronger when we work with others towards shared goals in ways that respect each other's national interests.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I mentioned earlier, these shared goals are not just about improving our defence capabilities. We must also work together in efforts to reduce tensions and to maintain the peace and security that have underpinned our economic prosperity and way of life. As we saw recently, foreign minister, Penny Wong, and defence minister, Richard Marles, and many other ministers have gone abroad to re-establish and reconnect with some of our closest friends—not just in our region of the Pacific but in Asia, Europe and the United States. It is so important to have very strong friendships when it comes to those who we have been shoulder to shoulder with in times of war and times of real need. As we have done with our friends in Ukraine, the solidarity and support that we have given them is so vitally important.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">By recognising that we have shared goals with our allies and collaborate in an effort to achieve those goals, we achieve more in our own interests than we ever could if we acted in isolation. It is entirely appropriate that the Australian public and the parliament have confidence that when we enhance our defence capability that we never trade away our sovereignty. The Deputy Prime Minister was very much on point today when stating that we will not trade sovereignty for capability, because the only point of increased capability is to strengthen our sovereignty.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Question agreed to.</span>

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Customs Legislation Amendment (Controlled Trials and Other Measures) Bill 2022 will amend the <span style="font-style:italic;">Customs Act 1901</span> (Customs Act) to establish a new regulatory framework (known as Regulatory Sandboxes) to undertake time-limited trials of trade and customs practices and technologies, with approved entities, in a controlled regulatory environment, before committing to legislative change. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Regulatory Sandboxes ensure regulation keeps pace with industry developments, remains fit-for-purpose and does not become a barrier to innovation and productivity. This is among the first regulatory sandbox mechanisms identified within a Customs framework, worldwide.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill will enable the modification or waiver of existing licensing, importing and exporting obligations under the Customs Act, for trial periods of up to 12 to 18 months. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill will enable Australia's whole-of-Government Simplified Trade System agenda, which seeks to simplify and digitise the trade system to deliver tangible benefits for Australian businesses, enable trade growth and better protect the community.</span>

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Improving paid parental leave is critical reform. It is critical for families, it is critical for women and it is critical for the economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Albanese Government know this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We know that paid parental leave is vital for the health and wellbeing of parents and their children.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We know that investing in paid parental leave benefits our economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">And we know that done right, paid parental leave can advance gender equality. We heard these messages loud and clear at our successful Jobs and Skills Summit in September, where gender equality and economic reform went hand in hand.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Businesses, unions, experts and economists all understand that one of the best ways to boost productivity and participation is to provide more choice and more support for families—and more opportunity for women.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">That is why Paid Parental Leave reform was a centrepiece of our first Budget, and is supported by the whole Cabinet for the clear benefits it will bring.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Prime Minister himself said at the time, "a parental leave system that empowers the full and equal participation of women will be good for business, good for families and good for our economy."</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We are on the right track. This Bill, the Paid Parental Leave Amendment (Improvements for Families and Gender Equality) Bill 2022, implements the first tranche of the Government's Paid Parental Leave changes announced in the Budget.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It introduces a range of important structural changes to modernise the Paid Parental Leave scheme to ensure it better meets the needs of Australian families. Crucially, the Bill gives more families access to the Government payment, provides parents more flexibility in how they take leave, and encourages them to share care to support gender equality.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">These changes, to commence from 1 July 2023, are the first stage of the Government's reforms and lay the foundation for expansion. Then, from July 2024, we will progressively increase the scheme by six weeks until it reaches 26 weeks in 2026—a full six months. This is the largest expansion since Labor established the scheme in 2011.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I am pleased that our changes have been widely welcomed by family and gender advocates, and employer and unions groups, including the ACTU, the Business Council of Australia, the Parenthood, Minderoo's Thrive by Five Foundation, Chief Executive Women and the Equality Rights Alliance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This is a significant reform, driven by our commitment to get the settings right to maximise women's economic equality. That is why we are introducing the reform in two stages—to take immediate first steps to improve the scheme through this Bill, and to give us time to work through the options for expansion, drawing on expert advice. This includes advice from the independent Women's Economic Equality Taskforce, which the Government has asked to examine the optimal model for the additional six weeks to maximise women's economic equality.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill, and the expansion to 26 weeks by 2026, reflects the Government's commitment to deliver better outcomes for families and advance economic equality for women. The roughly 180,000 families who receive the payment each year will benefit from a fairer, more flexible and more generous scheme. Not only will our changes help families better balance work and care, but they will also support participation and productivity over the longer term, providing a dividend for the Australian economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Australians need a Paid Parental Leave scheme that reflects the needs of modern families.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The current scheme does not do enough to provide access for fathers and partners. Currently, dads take Government-paid leave at roughly half the rate of mums. The scheme as it stands today is built on gendered assumptions of 'primary' and 'secondary' carers, which limit parents' ability to share care. Our Bill fixes this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The current scheme does not treat families equally. The eligibility rules are unfair to families where the mother is the higher income earner. You could have two families with a household income of $200,000—one family is eligible because the father is the primary income earner; the other is ineligible because the mother is the primary income earner. Our Bill fixes this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Under the current scheme, a father or partner who is a citizen or permanent resident can be ineligible purely because the birth mother doesn't meet the income test or residency requirements. Our Bill fixes this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">From 1 July 2023, the Bill delivers six key changes:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">1. combining the two existing payments into a single 20 week scheme,</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">2. reserving a portion of the scheme for each parent to support them both to take time off work after birth or adoption,</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">3. making it easier for both parents to access the payment by removing the notion of 'primary' and 'secondary' carers,</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">4. expanding access by introducing a $350,000 family income test, under which people can qualify if they do not meet the $156,647 individual income test,</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">5. increasing flexibility for parents to choose how they take paid parental leave days and transition back to work, and</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">6. allowing eligible fathers and partners to access the payment irrespective of whether the mother or birth parent meets the income test or residency requirements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is critical this Bill passes both Houses by March next year, so parents expecting to give birth or adopt on or after 1 July 2023 have the option of pre- claiming three months in advance, so they can receive their Government entitlement as soon as they are eligible.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Currently, there are two payments under the Government scheme. Parental Leave Pay, which provides up to 18 weeks of payment, is primarily targeted to mothers, while Dad and Partner Pay provides up to two weeks of payment to fathers and partners.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Under this Bill, Parental Leave Pay and Dad and Partner Pay will be combined to form a single 20 week payment that can be shared between both parents.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This will give parents more choice and flexibility in how they use and share care, better reflecting how Australian families want to parent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">One of the features of the current scheme is a period of leave for exclusive use by fathers and partners, in the form of Dad and Partner Pay. Our changes preserve this important feature by reserving two weeks of the payment for each parent. By incorporating this reserved portion under a single scheme, rather than as a stand-alone payment, we are making sharing of parental leave between parents a central part of the scheme. This Bill supports both parents to take leave beyond the two-week reserved period. Importantly, single parents will be eligible for the full 20 weeks.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Another significant benefit of the move to a single 20-week scheme is it allows fathers and partners to receive the Government payment at the same time as employer-paid leave. While this is currently available to mothers, legislation requires fathers and partners to be on unpaid leave in order to receive Dad and Partner Pay.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Fixing this inequity removes a financial disincentive for fathers and partners to access the scheme and take time off work to care for a child.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Allowing both parents to claim the Government payment alongside employer- paid leave makes it easier for them to maintain their income while caring for their child, and should result in more dads taking leave.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government has been very clear on the role employers should play—the Government's 20-week scheme is the baseline—a national minimum standard. We are encouraged that there are already enlightened employers across Australia competing to offer working parents the best possible deal.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We know what happens when both parents are not supported to take time off paid work to care for their babies—usually mum works much less, or leaves the workforce altogether to take on caring responsibilities, while dad remains in full-time work. This pattern persists for years after the child's birth and is a key driver of gender gaps in workforce participation and earnings.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government supports dads and non-birth parents to share the load of caring responsibilities. We know that when they do, it benefits everyone. When fathers take a greater caring role from the start, this establishes patterns of shared care that continue throughout the child's life. In addition to benefits for women and their economic equality, there are also physical, mental and social benefits for men and their children.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The changes in this Bill send a clear message that the Government values men as carers too, and we want to see that reinforced in workplaces and our communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill improves gender equality and inclusion under the scheme by removing the notion of 'primary' and 'secondary' carers and allowing all eligible parents to claim the payment. Currently, mothers must make a successful claim for Parental Leave Pay, and then transfer the payment to their partner if they wish to share some or all of it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This process is complex, administratively burdensome and makes it difficult for fathers and partners to take leave, even when it is in the best interests of the family. In 2021-22, less than one per cent of mothers transferred some of the payment to the father or a partner.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The new, simpler claiming process will also allow eligible fathers and partners to qualify if the mother or birth parent does not meet the income test or the residency requirements. Over 2,000 additional fathers and partners</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">will have access to the scheme each year because of this change.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The shift to a gender-neutral claiming process is also important because it is more inclusive and recognises that Australian families are diverse.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">To guard against any negative consequences for mothers resulting from the new process, the birth parent will have to approve the amount of leave claimed by the other parent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill will also introduce a family income limit of $350,000, which will operate alongside the existing individual income limit (currently $156,647 per annum). Parents, including single parents, will be eligible for the payment if they meet either the individual income or the family income test.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">With the introduction of a family income limit, families will no longer be denied access solely because of the income of the mother. This change is expected to particularly benefit families where the mother is the primary income earner, with nearly 3,000 additional parents becoming eligible each year as a result.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This change is long overdue—between the 2010 and 2017 financial years, the number of women with a taxable income of more than $150,000 has more than doubled. The introduction of a more generous family income test will help ensure the scheme keeps up with the times.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is improving flexibility for families to balance work and family life in a way that best suit their needs. Currently, Parental Leave Pay is split into a 12-week period that must be taken in a continuous block, within 12 months of the birth, followed by six weeks that can be taken flexibly, within two years from the date of birth or adoption.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Currently, if a parent returns to work before the end of their continuous 12-week Paid Parental Leave period, they forfeit any remaining days of the 12-week period. This limits choice for parents, and particularly mothers, in how they transition back to work.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Under these amendments, parents can take all of the payment in multiple blocks, as small as a day at a time, within two years of the birth or adoption of the child. This flexibility will support mothers to return to work whenever they wish, without the risk of losing their entitlements. This will particularly benefit parents who work part-time or are self-employed to continue working after a birth or adoption.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Of course, some birth parents may still wish to take most or all of the payment in a continuous block, and the legislation supports parents to do this if they choose.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We know this is an important option to support physical and mental health and breastfeeding, particularly for mothers who do not have access to any employer- paid leave. Supporting maternal and child health and development remains an important objective of the Paid Parental Leave scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In addition, both parents will have the option of taking Government-paid leave on the same day for up to 10 days of the payment. This will help parents share caring responsibilities from the start, and help dads and partners care for mothers to support their health and wellbeing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In summary, it is critical that our Paid Parental Leave scheme supports modem Australian families—a scheme that is flexible, fair and drives positive health, social and economic outcomes for both parents and their children. This Bill does just that. Crucially, it gives more families access to the Government payment, provides parents more flexibility in how they take leave, and encourages them to share care to support gender equality.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill is good for parents, good for kids, good for employers and good for the economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Work Health and Safety Amendment Bill 2022 implements recommendations from the review of the model work health and safety laws, conducted by Ms Marie Boland in 2018. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I would like to thank Ms Boland for her considered examination of the model work health and safety laws and her important recommendations. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I would also like to acknowledge those families who have lost a loved one at work for giving their time to speak or write to Ms Boland. You continue to fight tirelessly to improve the system that let you down to ensure that others do not have to face the same heartbreak as you have. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Boland report contained 34 recommendations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">So far, not one of the recommendations requiring legislative change has been implemented in the Commonwealth jurisdiction—but this Bill will change that. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill doesn't address the most critical recommendations, but its swift implementation signals how serious this Government is about taking action on work health and safety. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We can do better, we will do better. This Bill is the first step. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Most significantly, the Bill expands the most serious offence under the Commonwealth's current work health and safety laws to include negligence as a fault element. The bar for conviction is currently set too high. This change means that both reckless and grossly negligent employers who expose workers to serious risks will face the most serious consequences and penalties. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill will prevent a person required to pay a penalty under the law from recovering that penalty under a contract of insurance. The penalties in the Act are there as a deterrent. Allowing companies to take out insurance against these penalties makes workplace injuries just another cost of doing business. Prohibiting such insurance forces businesses to take their work health and safety duties seriously. No longer will a statutory penalty just be another line on a balance sheet that an employer can recover from their insurer, while a family has lost a loved one in a workplace fatality.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill clarifies that a health and safety representative is able to choose their own course of training and removes the requirement for the health and safety representative to make this decision 'in consultation with the person conducting a business or undertaking'. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We are also introducing amendments to align service notice provisions to ensure clarity and consistency across the Work Health and Safety Act.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill also amends the <span style="font-style:italic;">Safe Work Australia Act 2008</span> to clarify that information may be shared with Safe Work Australia when the information is relevant to their statutory data and evidence functions. Safe Work Australia publishes data that is central to work health and safety and workers compensation policy development. Without a decent body of substantive data, governments are limited in their ability to develop good policy that solves real issues. In particular, Safe Work Australia maintains and publishes the Traumatic Injury Fatalities database and the National Data Set for Compensation-Based Statistics, without which we would have no clear view of the extent of work health and safety issues in Australia. This sensible amendment will ensure that Safe Work Australia can continue receiving information necessary to its research and data publication efforts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Safe Work Australia undertook extensive tripartite consultation seeking feedback on implementing key recommendations of the Boland Review in the model Work Health and Safety laws. This involved consultation across all jurisdictions and with union and employer representatives. In June 2022, the model Work Health and Safety Bill was amended in line with this process. </span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill would harmonise the WHS Act with the recent changes to the model Work Health and Safety laws. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">You don't need to look very far to find a recent story about the healthcare crisis—waiting times for appointments, lack of access to basic health services, cost of services forcing families to make a decision about whether to go to the doctor or whether to pay the rent, the availability of medicines and burnout amongst healthcare staff. All of these things are felt even more acutely in rural and remote areas.</span>

Last year the Greens initiated an inquiry into barriers to accessing sexual maternity and reproductive health services and education across Australia. That inquiry has received about 2,000 submissions, which is a testament to the importance of this issue to so many. When the hearings kick off in a few weeks time I'll look forward to hearing more about the experiences that people are having across this country and finding solutions—and then begging the government to implement them.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Two key principles of the national consensus framework for rural maternity services were that women should have access to safe maternity care as close as possible to where they live and that any decisions about the development, sustainability, downgrading or closure of rural maternity services must be evidence based, transparent, subject to independent impact assessment and taken in consultation with the local community. It sounds good, but none of those principles are being achieved in Queensland.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In June 2019, a Queensland rural maternity task force highlighted the need for action in workforce planning and resourcing to address barriers to access. The report opens with this observation:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Every day in Queensland, rural and remote women leave family and business, travel long distances on rough roads often without the security of mobile phone coverage, and endure financial, social, and emotional hardship just to access the maternity care that urban people have on their doorstep.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That task force made a series of recommendations. The President of the Rural Doctors Association of Queensland, Dr Matt Masel, has said that not only has there been little progress but, in fact, the inequity confronting rural and remote women has only worsened.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Maternity units remain under considerable strain across my state. The Biloela and Gladstone hospital maternity wards have been on bypass for many months, forcing families to travel a significant distance to Rockhampton just to have their babies. My Gladstone based colleague, Senator Allman-Payne, is going to talk a lot more about that situation and the devastating impact it's having on the families. Despite the desperate pleas to the Queensland Department of Health, it looks like the women in the Gladstone community and in Biloela will be waiting until at least midyear before they can give birth in their own towns.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Meanwhile, staffing issues threaten to derail plans to resume the delivery of babies at Cooktown hospital and to establish a birthing service at Weipa hospital. Doctors are concerned that staff shortages could see restrictions on obstetrics at Innisfail Hospital. For many First Nations women in northern Queensland, these are familiar stories. Far too many First Nations women and pregnant people are forced to travel to larger centres to give birth away from country and away from family support.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This crisis in maternity healthcare access is replicated in access to reproductive health care. Too often, whether or not someone can get unbiased, timely advice about their options and, if they choose an abortion, access to safe, supportive abortion care depends on their postcode. Abortion care is health care and it should be accessible to all those who need it, no matter where they live or how much money they have in their bank account.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Townsville and Rockhampton, Marie Stopes had been the only provider of surgical abortions for many years. In 2021, the service closed. They told me that it closed because they couldn't get the financial support they needed from the government to keep the doors open. Since then, women and pregnant people living in Townsville have had to travel hundreds of kilometres to Brisbane, generally, often at huge expense, to terminate an unwanted pregnancy. They only have a small window in which they can do so legally.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In October last year the Queensland government gave $1 million to the Townsville Hospital and health services to restore surgical termination services to the region to try to refill that gap, but it was announced last week that those services will be delayed again, until at least mid-March, while Townsville Hospital recruits the necessary staff. For pregnant people in the region who are nearing the 14-week limit for surgical abortions, that additional delay will mean the difference between accessing an abortion locally and having to travel to Brisbane and needing the funds to do so.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The additional stress, uncertainty, cost and risks that the lack of services is causing pregnant people in regional Queensland is unacceptable. We cannot have a situation where people facing an unwanted pregnancy can only access safe and supportive abortion care if they have the resources to travel. Likewise, we can't have a situation where people feel forced to elect a caesarean birth to minimise their risks. We shouldn't have a situation where families who have been supported by a midwife throughout pregnancy are forced to give birth in a distant hospital without continuing that midwife support or where parents from First Nations and culturally diverse communities are separated from their families into a daunting, unfamiliar and clinical environment at a time when they most need cultural support.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need immediate and long-term solutions to address maternity and reproductive healthcare access issues. We need comprehensive and system-wide planning of rural maternity services, including workforce rotations. We need abortion in public hospitals. We need more recruitment and retention initiatives and incentives, better work flow management and funding to make it happen. We need to expand Medicare coverage for midwifery services and home births to give families more choice about how they birth. Bundled funding and continuity-of-care models have been recommended in the women-centred care strategy and by the participating midwives task force in the previous MBS review, and we need to start listening. This government needs to start listening. We need more birthing-on-country initiatives led by Aboriginal community-controlled health organisations. Services need to be designated to meet the needs of diverse communities in consultation with the communities they serve. We also know that attracting doctors and midwives to regional areas is made harder by the lack of housing, the lack of schools and the lack of social infrastructure.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Improving the lives of people in the regions demands a holistic approach. We need action. I know that this is an issue that the Minister for Women, Senator Gallagher and the Assistant Minister for Health and Aged Care, the Hon. Ged Kearney, take seriously, and I look forward to working with them and any member in this place to tackle those barriers that are preventing women from accessing the health care they need when and where they need it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Women have been waiting far too long to get access to basic health care. The situation is getting worse, and we deserve better.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="140651" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator O'NEILL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:57</span>):  I listened carefully to the contribution of Senator Waters. As a party that has made quotas for the representation of women in Australia just part of doing business, I am very proud to stand here as a member of the Labor Party with so many women in my caucus. We discuss all of these issues at length and are here to represent women right across the country—women with a wide range of views on many matters. Senator Waters indicated in the motion before the Senate that there are issues such as inadequate funding and a lack of workforce planning that have closed or restricted many maternity and reproductive health services around the country. She highlights in particular remote and regional areas. I say to people who might be listening to this contribution, as the Senate draws to the close of its first week of work here, that we have a mountain of work to do as an incoming government. We're approaching nine months now, but we've got nearly 10 years of failed health policy to undo and have to reconstruct a path forward for Australians in terms of giving them equitable access to health.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I did undertake, shortly after the arrival of the Abbott government, 52 hearings around the country for the select health committee. There was a massive reduction in funding for national partnership health agreements, which through a flow-on effect through the community led to the massive erosion that followed in community health care. I can remember in the region where I live on the Central Coast just an indicator of what was happening around the rest of the country. Because the federal government had squibbed it, because Prime Minister Abbott took money out—and that was just the beginning of the money drain that was characteristic of the previous government—the state governments made decisions to keep the hospitals open but they absolutely demolished community health.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a woman and, happily, as a woman who's able to have children and delights in my motherhood of my now grown children, I was in a position where there was no impact directly on me in terms of access to maternity services. But I know that on the Central Coast one of the programs that was withdrawn and pulled apart was pre- and postnatal care for First Nations young women. That was one of the first casualties when the relationships between state and federal governments broke down by the action of the former Prime Minister of Australia, Mr Abbott, when he was elected. That was just the start of the wrecking ball through health brought by Mr Abbott, then followed by Mr Turnbull and—what can we say of the man who brought up the end of the regime!—Mr Morrison. The consequences are with us now—nine years long.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Nine months in, I want to put on the record an announcement that was made, that was brought to fruition by this government, which is doing what it said it would do for Australian people, and that is our declaration today from Minister Clare, the Minister for Education; Minister Butler, the Minister for Health and Aged Care; and my good friend Emma McBride, the Assistant Minister for Rural and Regional Health, about wiping the debt for rural and remote doctors and nurses practitioners. That is going to have a very significant impact on access for women in regional and rural Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This was the Higher Education Support Amendment (2022 Measures No. 1) Bill 2022. It doesn't sound like it has much to do with the topic we're discussing today, which is improved access to health care, particularly with a focus on women, but this is the reality of good government doing the work of government in the national interest. It responds to concerns raised by Senator Waters about the need for immediate and long-term strategies and funding to address the crisis that we have in the workforce. Essentially, what happened today and what became law in Australia is that a doctor or a nurse practitioner who lives and works in rural and remote Australia will have their HELP debt wiped under legislation, as a result of the action of the Albanese government fulfilling our commitments made to the Australian people prior to the election—that we would begin the task of redressing the terrible, terrible state in which the former government left the health services of this nation. So, for those who are listening, you may know a doctor, you may know a nurse or you may know somebody who's engaged in study or wanting to engage in study. This is an important program because doctors and nurse practitioners who choose to live and work in the places that need them, particularly in rural and regional settings, will have most of their HELP debt reduced or wiped.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The HELP debt reduction for a doctor or nurse practitioner will depend on the length of their course of study and the amount of outstanding HELP debt they have when they commence providing eligible services in an eligible location. There will be a significant investment of Australian taxpayers' dollars in this redress of a massive failure by the previous government. So the fact is that doctors who live and work in rural and remote parts of Australia could save on average $70,000 and a nurse practitioner could save up to $20,000. So, if they work in a remote or a very remote town for a time period half the length of their course, they would have their entire HELP debt wiped.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know communities. I've been to communities in remote and very remote towns not just in New South Wales, particularly in the seat of Parkes—and I'm talking about places like Lightning Ridge, Bourke, Wilcannia and out in Broken Hill, where there is an incredible challenge in attracting and retaining health professionals—but also in Western Australia, visiting communities around Broome and as far over as Halls Creek in the west and the eastern Kimberley. The access to services is so diabolical, with a workforce that is just flown in and flown out, that many of the First Nations representatives who gave evidence to the committee—and I'm very mindful of the great work done there with former Greens senator Rachel Siewert—described health professionals and 'white Toyotas'. That was their generic term. That's all they knew about them—they'd see white Toyotas arriving and white Toyotas leaving, and no continuity of care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know, as a woman, how much of my life plan was built on the hope that I might become a mother. When I fell pregnant I was absolutely delighted to be able to access continuous health care for the course of my pregnancy, and to be confident that in my early maternity my child would be cared for and that I would be able to get access to services. This is no longer the lived reality of people, whether they're in remote and regional towns or even an hour-and-a-half out of major cities. So broken is the health system after nine years of Liberal Party and National Party wrecking that people cannot even get into see the doctor.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Programs like I am reporting to the Senate today, which relieve people of their HELP debt, are going to make a very big difference to the way in which young people might consider how they would build a professional future in medicine to provide not just maternity care but also child care and, around the edges of that, I dare say, a little bit of aged care as well. If a doctor or a nurse practitioner decides to move to a large, medium or small rural town for a period equal to the whole length of their course, they also have their entire HELP debt waived. An eligible place for a period equivalent to half the time required is eligible for half the applicable debt reduction. How many doctors is this expected to attract? I'm pleased to report to the Senate and to Senator Waters—who I'm sure is very interested in the outcomes and not just the description of the problem—that this will attract about 850 doctors and nurse practitioners every single year. That's what's anticipated. This has to be music to the ears of people in regional and rural Australia. They know things are absolutely desperate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've spoken to many, many women in hospitals, to staff in hospitals talking about their families, and to people that I've met in the seats of Parkes, Farrer and the Riverina—but particularly up in Parkes—where they need to move into a motel accommodation in Dubbo up to a month before their delivery date to actually be ready to get into the care they need. By the time I had my third child, I was little more comfortable about the whole process, but let me tell you: for every woman who is blessed to have a first pregnancy, the care that you receive is something you will never forget. Being able to access that care is a critical part of the survival of your child and your mental health and wellbeing in what can be a tumultuous part of your life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">People have needed access to health services for a very, very long time. What's shocking is that the government of Australia between 2013 and 2022 took away the rights of Australians to access the health care that they deserve. Every time we pay our taxes, our tax dollars are an investment in our country and the future of our country, and we have a right to expect that basic things will not be eroded by the government we elect, yet that is exactly what happened under the former government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm delighted that this particular piece of legislation went through today and will move on to assent. This is a fantastic outcome. And, as I said before, this is a sign of the government showing up to do its day job. Australians are out working, living and doing all the things they do as great citizens of this country. They expect the government to come in and do things that will make their lives better, not worse. We know that this particular incentive to bring 850 doctors and nurse practitioners into the workforce in regional and rural Australia is a signature, immediate and long-term policy decision enacted by the will of this parliament and led by Mr Albanese, Minister Butler, Minister McBride and Minister Clare. They got together; they figured it out. They figured out what would help Australians—not what would harm Australians. I dare say that, as a result of this initiative, my sisters across the nation, the women of Australia, will significantly benefit.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In speaking about sexual and reproductive health, we're speaking about the rights of all Australians being a key priority for the Australian government, and, for women, access to an abortion is an issue that's captured much of the public space and column inches. I also want to stand, though, as a woman of faith, alongside other women of multiple faiths, who might have a different view about abortion. Access to an abortion for all Australian women in our civil society is a very important thing. But there are people who might not hold that view, people who desperately want assistance to maintain their pregnancy, and that is an important consideration. That must be part of what the government undertakes and what senators undertake as we move forward. We live in a multicultural, multifaith, vibrant, pluralist democracy. There are multiple views about reproductive health to which we should always be sensitive, because that reflects our rich diversity. So, as a woman of faith, as a Catholic woman, I urge that committee to look at access to pregnancy care in the fullest sense. Every single possible permutation needs to be given fair and proper consideration. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I close by thanking Senator Waters for bringing forward this matter for discussion today. I am very glad that as a member of a government I'm able to stand here and—unlike the case so often in the last nine years—not make excuses about failures but put on the record a legislative success that is about building a better workforce to give Australians everywhere, including in regional Australia, a much better chance to access the health care that they deserve.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:12</span>):  I, too, today stand to talk to the motion that's been moved by Senator Waters. I thank her for moving the motion about health care in rural and regional Australia, and the health care that rural and regional Australian women in particular deserve. I'm sure that you will agree, Senator Waters, that access to health care and other services should not be determined by the postcode in which you were born in or in which you choose to live. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Australia we pride ourselves on equity. But we know that, unfortunately, there are challenges in rural and regional Australia that make healthcare service delivery much more challenging. We know there are fewer resources that are applied out there as a result of the sparser populations. We know that that results in limited availability of the healthcare professionals that are so needed, and they include our obstetricians and our gynaecologists, our paediatricians and our midwives, and all the other amazing healthcare workers that support those health professionals, in assisting Australian women who live outside metropolitan areas through their pregnancy and the birth of their children. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly, we do also know that there is a poorer health status and there are poorer outcomes for those living in rural and regional Australia. And, of course, when they need to get additional levels of care, they have to travel great distances. So we know that it is extraordinarily important that we apply innovation to any of the decisions that we make, to meet the needs of rural, regional and remote Australians, and of rural, remote and regional women, because the application of a one-size-fits-all model, whether it be in health care or aged care, is not going to work in rural and regional Australia. So we must stop focusing on city-centric models of care, and we must make sure that we understand the nuances that exist in rural, regional and remote Australia, not the least of which are the challenges facing many of our Indigenous communities, because we know they, too, are struggling with access to the kinds of maternity and health services that people in the city probably take for granted.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Before moving on to the specifics of the motion that's before us, I'd also like to acknowledge Senator O'Neill's contribution and thank her for, probably unwittingly, acknowledging the good government that was previously the government of this nation, the coalition government. It was actually the coalition government who put forward the waiving of HECS debts for those rural and regional doctors and nurses, a part of our policy which the Labor government copycat adopted. I think Senator O'Neill should probably look back a little bit further than the last five minutes, to realise that many of the initiatives that are currently being enacted by this government are actually just copycat initiatives of those that were put forward by the previous government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Nonetheless, I'm sure the most important thing is that doctors and nurses in rural and regional Australia are being provided additional incentives to go to rural and regional Australia, because we absolutely know that so far there has been very little, if anything, in terms of assistance for rural and regional Australia in the healthcare sector. In fact, most of the initiatives that have been put in place by this government have had a detrimental impact on rural and regional Australia. For context, I'll provide some examples of that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The very first decision of the new health minister that I became aware of was the decision to expand the distribution priority areas, that previously had been focused on rural and regional Australia, to allow doctors to move to what was referred to as MM2 areas. This means that overseas trained doctors—or international medical graduates, as they're currently called—are no longer required to do a stint in rural, regional or remote Australia before they move back into metropolitan areas. They can now move immediately, straight to our metropolitan areas, and start practising. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This has meant not only that any new IMGs, international medical graduates, who come into the country no longer have to go to rural and regional Australia but that those already in rural and regional Australia can move to the city. Sadly, we have found, time and time again, that doctors who were previously operating and practising in rural and regional areas have taken the easy option and moved into the outer metropolitan areas, often leaving their communities with no doctor at all. Next week, in estimates, we'll prosecute a number of these areas where we have seen that happen.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reality is that rural, regional and remote Australia is the canary in the coalmine when it comes to challenges, in many areas, not the least of which is health care. Right now, we know that workforce shortages is the most significant issue impacting our care sector—whether it be health care, aged care or disability care—right the way across the country. It is hitting hardest in rural, regional and remote Australia. What we are saying to this government is it is absolutely essential that you address the cause of the problem. We need some urgency put into addressing the workforce shortages that we're seeing. We know that unless we deal with the issue of workforce shortages, we are not going to be able to deal with many of the other issues that are currently before our health system.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To that end, it was extraordinarily distressing to find out that—whether it was by design or by incompetence—the minister for immigration failed to list the 887 skilled regional migration visas on the priority list. We welcomed the government's decision to prioritise—as we had—healthcare workers, whether they be doctors, nurses or care workers, and education workers, most predominantly teachers, by fast-tracking the visa applications of these people coming into the country. We knew that we had challenges as a result of COVID. Of course, we didn't have migration for many, many months—in fact, for a couple of years—and so we welcomed the fast-tracking of these visa applications. But we then found, by accident or design, that 887 skilled regional visas were excluded from the priority list, basically relegating doctors, nurses, teachers and care workers—who would otherwise have chosen to go to rural, regional and remote Australia to undertake their caring responsibilities—to the bottom of the visa pile.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my own home town, I've had many representations from people in my community who are frustrated by the fact that its's taking, on average, 27 months to get access to an approval process for an 887 visa. It's absolutely unacceptable that this government should have relegated rural, regional and remote Australia to the bottom of the pile when we know that it's rural, regional and remote Australia that is, often, hardest hit when it comes to these sorts of services. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It hasn't just been in my home area of the Riverland. I've spoken, right the way across the country, to doctors, nurses and health institutions only to hear the same story over and over again. Rural, regional and remote Australia are ignored. They're treated as poor cousins. We need to make sure we have the appropriate incentives so that equity of health care is something that all Australians can rely on—instead of just talking about it. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why we're saying the government needs to come up with real solutions, real and tangible measures that will deal with workforce crises so that we can see the whole of our care sector adequately supported. Right now, all we're seeing is healthcare workers in rural, regional and remote Australia being sucked into the city because of the greater ability of those institutions to afford it. And measures that have been put in place by this government are encouraging those people that are currently in rural and regional Australia to move into these city areas. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is not just rural, regional or remote when we talk about small towns and communities that are very far from capital cities. They are, of course, the hardest hit, but it even applies to places like Geelong. In the last few weeks, we saw an announcement by the Epworth Geelong private hospital that it is intending to close its maternity services in March. The reason they stated was 'workforce shortages'. We have a massive hospital—that was delivering 500 to 600 babies a year—making the decision that it can no longer safely deliver its services because it cannot get access to workforce. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a very sad reflection that, despite the Labor Party coming into government on the promise that it was going to support the workforce—they were going to deal with the issues that we all knew COVID had delivered to our healthcare sector; they were going to assist—we have seen nothing, when it comes to addressing the workforce challenges. We have a massive, glaring example of that in Victoria with the Epworth hospital's recent decision. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to also understand that there are other measures that can assist rural and regional Australia in dealing with the challenges before us. One of those is telehealth. We saw this government rip 70 telehealth services out of the Medicare support network, and we're fearful that there are moves afoot for more telehealth services to be removed from the Medicare rebate or MBS system. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that it's people who live in rural, regional and remote Australia who are more likely to be accessing telehealth. This is simply because they either can't get in to see a doctor, because of the massive workforce shortages, or they live so far away from where a doctor is that sometimes the only opportunity for them to get access to healthcare is over the phone. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to change the way we look at addressing some of these challenges and stop admiring the problems. Stop talking them down. Stop talking about the negatives of the situation. Eight and a half months into government, we'd like to see the government put some real measures on the table. Deliver on your urgent care clinics. Don't keep coming in here and talking about them, actually deliver them. We know that some three months out from the date this government promised we would have urgent care clinics up and running—by the middle of May—not one urgent care clinic is up and running. All we have is seven clinics with expressions of interest. We don't know where they're going to be.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Equally, we've seen measure after measure, promise after promise, not delivered. They went to the election and said they'd strengthen Medicare. Medicare has weakened. They went to the election promising to put care back to aged care. The aged-care sector is in crisis, at the moment, because of the undeliverable mandated requirements of those opposite. Of course we want to see our aged-care facilities provide the best possible care for our older Australians, but you can't mandate the impossible. That's exactly what you've done, and you will see rural, regional and remote nursing homes close because they just won't be able to meet these requirements. So what are you going to say to those older Australians who will have to move hundreds of miles away from their loved ones because you have mandated a requirement that is impossible to deliver?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, the greatest challenges before us are workforce and putting the confidence of Australians back into general practice, neither of which have been done by this government. In fact, the exact opposite has occurred. There have been issues in addressing workforce, issues that have actually had a detrimental effect on the rural and regional Australian health workforce, through the changes to DPA and the refusal to accept 887 visas as being a priority class.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the same time, we have a minister who constantly talks about all of the negatives in the health system, who is always saying that there's a crisis and that there's a problem—he's admiring the problem day in, day out—and who is doing nothing to support our GPs. We have not seen him say a word about the fact that the states and territories have been threatening to add a greater payroll burden on our general practice clinics right at a time when there is a crisis. We are seeing bulk billing rates falling like flies—a massive drop—and yet what this minister has done is actually nothing, apart from reducing the level of confidence that GPs have that this government is actually going to do anything about it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We'd certainly say to the state and territory governments: have a serious think about the decisions that you may be making in relation to enforcing a payroll tax, an additional financial burden on general practice, right at a time when they need our help and they need our understanding to make sure that we are able to build confidence back up in our healthcare system and particularly in general practice.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've heard so much about the negativity of general practice, but I want to give a shout-out to our general practitioners, who, on the whole, are the most amazing, hardworking frontline people. They are the people who are absolutely at the centre of our care in Australia. If we don't have a strong general practice sector in this country, our health sector is in big trouble. So we need to address the issues that are the most burning at the moment. We need to address the issues that are fundamental and the cause of the problems that are facing our healthcare sector, and they are workforce and confidence in general practice.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we stand here today, we know that rural, regional and remote Australia is the place where these issues are felt the most. We know, from the motion moved by Senator Waters, that women who live in rural, regional and remote Australia often have some of the poorer health outcomes and some of the lowest quality care because of an inability to access maternity, paediatric and obstetric services. It is very sad that we should be here today debating this particular motion, but I commend Senator Waters for raising the issue of rural, regional and remote access to health care and certainly want to put on the record my— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:28</span>):  I want to highlight the experiences of some of the expectant mothers in my community who've shared their stories:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I'm currently 23 weeks pregnant with my fourth child. All three of my kids were born in Gladstone, my last being only nine months old, born in April 2022.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Small">The situation we currently face of not having a place to birth here in town worries me every day. I have 3 kids to think about as well as my health and my baby's health when it comes time to give birth.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I have quick labours of around 1-2 hours so a trip to Rockhampton isn't an option for me. Neither is staying there weeks before my due date, as I have no help to get my kids to school and watched while I may need to be gone. The cost of having to stay in some hotel and the stress of not being in your own home at 38 weeks pregnant is daunting. Birth is already such an uncertain and unplanned thing, so having this major uncertainty about where I can birth is keeping me up at night.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">

                <span class="HPS-Small">The bypass hasn't just been hard on expecting mothers, it has also been hard on partners as well, watching and listening to the extra stress and worry on our partners who are about to take on one of the hardest challenges the human body will go through. They shouldn't have to worry about whether they are going to make the 1hr-1.5hr drive to another town to give birth.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Gladstone is an industrious town where a lot of the population work long hours, some working more than twelve hours a day in hot and physical jobs. These people are then asked to drive their labouring partner over an hour on a road that is always littered with potholes and rough bitumen. This is unsafe and dangerous. Even with an ambulance transfer the partners still have to drive themselves or risk not being able to support their partner and missing this precious moment. Things need to change, things need to happen and it needs to be sooner rather than later.</span>

We heard a lot, through those three days, of what Australians already know: inflationary pressures from external global factors and a decade of policy inaction are making household budgets tighter and placing pressure on people in this country who are struggling to afford the basics.</span>

We also heard from industry and the community about various aspects of the Albanese Labor government's policy agenda, which will provide a positive plan to reduce the cost of living. Our comprehensive and proactive policy approach on energy, on climate and on sustainability will reduce cost-of-living pressures, and it will ensure savings for Australian households.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The current cost-of-living crisis reveals the consequences not just of global factors but also of the former government's decade-long neglect of effective climate and energy policy, not to mention their failure on housing. The audacity to try and blame an eight-month-old government for a lack of housing supply is mind-boggling. Housing supply takes a lot longer than eight months. Australian families have been left to deal with this and the consequences of 22 failed energy policies by those opposite. The environment has also been left to suffer by the former government's failure to reduce emissions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My colleagues and I on this side of the chamber will not leave Australian families behind. We will deliver an ambitious climate and energy policy, we will build the housing of the future and we will ensure that Australia is recognised as a world leader. Our plan will also facilitate a secure and resilient economy to ensure that Australian families are not left to deal with the consequences of this cost-of-living crisis into the future. We will have a plan that is transparent, that is clear and that supports those in need.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our policy agenda—which includes the Climate Change Bill 2022, which was passed in this chamber last year—puts Australia back on track to net zero for 2050. What does that do? That opens up investment, gives us opportunities and gives us a way forward into the future so we're not left behind as a laggard on the international stage. Our plan also includes a $20 billion investment to upgrade and expand Australia's energy grid, unlocking new renewables, increasing the security of the grid and driving down power prices for Australian households.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I spoke to the Whyalla council this afternoon about the abundance of clean energy and hydrogen opportunities in that region and the significant interest that they are hearing from investors to build that region into a region for the future—to provide more jobs, to provide better, more available housing and to help them build their future in that region. But the opposition continues to oppose investments into renewables, despite the evidence from experts, such as Energy Consumers Australia, the Australian Energy Market Operator and the CSIRO, that renewables are the cheapest form of energy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the recent cost-of-living hearings, again, we heard from the Energy Consumers Australia policy director, Jacqueline Crawshaw, who highlighted the need for a balanced approach that addresses both clean energy and affordability. Yet we hear from those opposite that they want to invest in nuclear power, which is evidenced by CSIRO as the most expensive form of power. If we go to the most expensive form of power, we naturally go to the point where we say, 'That's got to be the most expensive when the costs are passed down to householders.' That is not a complicated pathway to follow. If you invest in the most expensive energy, you will get the most expensive power bills. If you invest in cheaper energy—in the energy that we know and that the evidence shows us is cheaper—you will get cheaper power bills. It's not that complicated. The abundance of jobs that we will get with these investments— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="266499" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator HUME</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:35</span>):  This year will be tough for many, many Australian households. Earlier this week, the Reserve Bank of Australia raised interest rates for the ninth consecutive month, taking interest rates to their highest level since September 2012. The RBA has signalled that there's still more to come:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The board expects that further increases in interest rates will be needed over the months ahead to ensure that inflation returns to target …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Why does the RBA hold these expectations? That's because there is no economic plan in sight from the Albanese government to get inflation under control.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just yesterday morning, the Treasurer said that it was the job of the RBA to get on top of this inflation challenge and that it was his job to do what he could to take some of the pressure off around the country for people who are doing it tough. That must have been news to the Minister for Finance, who said on Tuesday that dealing with inflation was in fact 'the defining economic challenge facing the country'. 'We have been very clear about that,' she said. It's alarming that no-one has told the Treasurer that his job is actually to do both. He needs to deliver an economic plan to deal with inflation and address the cost-of-living crisis. He's in government; he needs to act like it. The Treasurer is responsible for fiscal policy, and the RBA is responsible for monetary policy, but both are needed to ensure that we tackle inflation and keep the impact to a minimum. Right now, only the RBA is using its levers. Treasurer Chalmers thinks that it's alright to leave the RBA to do all of that heavy lifting, leaving Australian mortgage holders to bear the brunt of this Labor government's inaction on inflation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the Select Committee on Cost of Living last week, we heard that 800,000 mortgages will come off fixed rates in 2023. That's up to 800,000 households who will be feeling even more pressure on their budgets at the same time as they're dealing with higher grocery prices and higher energy prices. The main takeaway from those hearings was that higher prices and higher mortgages are leaving Australian families struggling to put food on the table. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Minister Tony Burke said on 15 June last year that people will see in their bank accounts what the change of government means. Well, he certainly was right, because Labor's cost-of-living crisis is very real. The Salvation Army said that one-third of people walking through their doors name the cost of living as why they need help. As a result of the increased demand from charities, Woolworths have increased their food donations by 20 per cent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Energy Regulator revealed that there has been a 12 per cent increase in people struggling to pay their power bills. Australians are crying out for their government to help them with the impact of inflation, with rising interest rates and with rising energy prices. This is a government that was elected on the basis of promises around the cost of living for Australians, and on 97 occasions it promised a $275 reduction in electricity bills. Now no-one from Labor will even say the words 'two hundred and seventy-five dollars'. Last week the cost-of-living committee heard that it would be impossible for Labor to deliver on its $275 promise—not only that but that Australians will be paying higher electricity prices this year. On top of that, the Energy Regulator confirmed that prices would not just increase throughout this year, despite Labor's proposed response—their ham-fisted market intervention—but also discourage long-term investment, meaning less supply and even higher prices in the long term.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to have a government that's focused on managing fiscal policy so the Reserve Bank doesn't have to do all that heavy lifting. In January, the Prime Minister said, 'My new year's resolution is to continue to deal with cost-of-living pressures.' Well, Prime Minister, it's February, and you've failed. Nothing has been done. You haven't got an economic plan for the 800,000 households who will see higher mortgages. You haven't got an economic plan for the millions of families who will pay more to keep the lights on. You haven't got an economic plan for the Australians who are struggling to put food on the table tonight, because they can't afford it. But, worst of all, you've failed because you and your Treasurer are not doing your jobs. You're not doing your jobs to tackle inflation. You're not doing your jobs to tackle the cost-of-living crisis. You're leaving it to the RBA to do all the heavy lifting, to raise interest rates, and you are doing nothing about it. This is a blight on your government, and it's time to step up and do the right thing with fiscal policy, not just leave it to the RBA.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:40</span>):  In less than an hour's time, the new NRL preseason kicks off with the Warriors playing the Tigers in Auckland. Around Australia and especially in my old neck of the woods, Sutherland Shire, rugby league is a massive part of peoples' lives. For those who don't know, NRL players, through their union, are currently negotiating with the NRL for a new collective bargaining agreement. This happens every five years. Everyone sits down and negotiates the salary cap, the minimum wage and the support fund for injured and retired players. It's just like the enterprise bargaining that takes place in workplaces around Australia every day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What isn't normal and what we should never accept in any work place is the NRL secretly recording conversations between players. Last Friday, an NRL official was caught secretly recording a conversation between players, their union and NRL CEO Andrew Abdo. As the Rugby League Players Association said in their letter to the NRL:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The deliberate and covert nature of the recording is breathtaking. It is immoral, unethical and illegal.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are the sorts of tactics that Amazon uses to intimidate their workers and to target anyone speaking out about working together on workplace issues. Amazon monitors their workers every second that they are at work, including how long they spend in the bathrooms, including who they meet with and what they talk about in the break rooms and even including what they say on their private social media accounts. We don't need companies importing Amazon surveillance tactics here in Australia, especially with a national institution like the NRL.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to speak also in support of what the players and the players union are actually fighting for in these negotiations. Some have dismissed this dispute as being about highly paid footy players wanting more money, but what it's really about is safety. It's about fairness. To quote Canberra Raiders prop Joseph Tapine:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We just want our voices heard because we are a big part of that NRL brand, we just want a seat at the table.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It's just about having a voice at the table and actually having a say …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What Joseph is saying there is that players should be consulted when the NRL changes their employment conditions during the course of this five-year agreement. It sounds pretty reasonable to me for any worker in Australia to have that right. The players and their union also want increased support for players dealing with injuries after they retire. The average first-grade career lasts just 45 games. As Raiders prop Josh Papali'i said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We sacrifice our bodies to entertain the public …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">…   …   …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It's a short career and most players have to go work after it and they're going to have to work with injuries that were caused by playing footy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, it sounds pretty reasonable for the NRL to look after the people who actually play the game.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last but certainly not least, the men's players are standing in solidarity with female players in the NRLW. Unlike the men's game, the NRLW does not have a collective bargaining agreement, which means they've got no security about their pay or conditions whatsoever. The players and the union are demanding that the women get their own agreement, which would include the first pregnancy and parental leave policy in the Rugby League. To quote Melbourne Storm prop Christian Welch:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I'm really passionate about improving the conditions for players and not necessarily just the men but the women. And at the moment, they can't sign contracts, they're not training.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">They're really in limbo to be honest …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It's hard for them to take action, so as part of our unity the men need to stand up—</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">and that's what they're doing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to commend the NRL players standing in solidarity with the NRLW players. It's about more than entertainment; it's about being a good sport.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator POLLEY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:44</span>):  I rise to speak about secure jobs and the strong economy that the government is focused on nurturing, because we know that strong jobs growth helps Australians to manage the cost of living.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government is putting jobs and skills at the top of the government's agenda, because we know the importance of a job to every individual. At the federal election, Labor committed to the establishment of Jobs and Skills Australia in its first 100 days, because we know how important it is to building our economy. It will inform and drive policy on skills and labour shortages. It will boost national productivity and get wages moving. Migration will play an important role in filling some of the skills gaps, but we must ensure that all Australians have the skills to apply for jobs and vacancies now and into the future. Government must be informed by the sectors which drive our economy and our country's productivity and prosperity. I am in contact with local businesses to understand their work shortages, business capacity and their annual turnover.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's a consensus that you need synergy between education outcomes and job vacancies; graduates are not necessarily graduating with the correct skills for the job vacancies within the community. Government must take the concerns and aspirations of business seriously, and this is why the Albanese government is continuing the government's commitment to consultation. Jobs and Skills Australia will provide independent advice on a range of current and emerging workforce, skill and training issues. It is advice to the government that will help inform the policies and programs that ensure Australia's training systems deliver the skills and workforce for the industries that are needed to ensure growth and prosperity within the Australian economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Job security is No. 1: without job security, people can't apply for home loans and they can't get a car loan. We know the value of having a job and of having a secure job. Jobs and Skills Australia will also play an important role in helping to strengthen Australia's economy. It will deliver this by leading research and analysis, undertaking workforce forecasting and analysis, and preparing capacity studies for emerging and growing industries. This will provide a greater understanding of current and emerging Australian workforce skill needs in order to strengthen Australian skills and the system policies and programs settings which are so vitally important. After nearly a decade of inaction under the previous government, made worse by the decision to abandon migrant workers during the pandemic lockdowns, it is so vital that we get a better understanding of the skills that we need now and into the future to drive the national skills policy. The Albanese government has a clear agenda to create secure, local jobs and to bring manufacturing back to our shores, ensuring we have enough jobs and that we have the skills to ensure the growth of our economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is so vitally important to my home state of Tasmania. That's why the Albanese government is committed to Tasmanians' interests in ensuring that we have the skills and opportunities to fill workplace and workforce shortages, and take opportunities for the future by investing in jobs and skills, tourism infrastructure, our agriculture industry and our food bowl. These are so critical to my home state: ensuring that every Tasmanian has the opportunity to secure a well-paid job that they can rely on and ensuring they have access to the better health care that they need. Labor will never leave any Australians on their own without ensuring that we do everything possible to make sure we have a strong economy and that we skill and educate the workforce for the future. That's why we're investing in TAFE. Unlike those opposite, we value TAFE—we value the skills that it provides to our economy. We support our university sector; we have to give people opportunities. A secure job with a well-trained workforce will improve productivity and the outcomes for the Australian economy will be so much better. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>
