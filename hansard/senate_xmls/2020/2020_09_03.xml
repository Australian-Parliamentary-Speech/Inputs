                  <span class="HPS-Normal">People will probably be getting a bit sick of the Greens raising the influence of dirty donations on political decision-making, but we're not going to stop raising it until we the influence of dirty money is removed from our politics. We have before us the Electoral Legislation Amendment (Miscellaneous Measures) Bill 2020. This bill, which we spent much of yesterday debating, allows donors to continue to donate to federal branches of parties in states that have strong donation laws, which we contend is a back door around those stronger state donations restrictions. Sadly, the bill has bipartisan support. So what we are doing now with this amendment (2) on sheet 1003 is trying to bring in the donations restrictions that we think will restore democracy as a function of the Australian people and ensure that democracy can't be for sale anymore.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are three elements to this amendment. Firstly, it redefines 'gift' to include party memberships and to include subscriptions to various different party forums. I will come back to that. Essentially, that refers to pay-for-access meetings—the lobster luncheons. It then bans completely donations from a number of industries that have a long history of seeking undue influence in return for political donations. That list is property developers, banks, tobacco, alcohol, gambling, big mining, defence and big pharma. The Greens think that those industries should not be able to donate one cent because they have a sordid history of seeking influence as a result of making those donations. Lastly—and this is perhaps the most important reform—we would like to see donations from everybody else, no matter whether you're an individual, on organisation or a corporation, capped at $1,000 a year or $3,000 for a three-year term, which, obviously, works out to $1,000 a year. That is a constitutional way of ensuring that people can still support causes that they believe in, but it makes sure that you can't buy undue influence and seek to have policies made to address your personal needs or to address and boost your personal corporate profits. We want to see big money out of politics entirely, and this is how you do it. You bring in public funding. You cap spending and, importantly, you cap donations and you stop donations from those industries that have long sought undue influence over decision-makers. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the time I have available to me, I want to give some statistics. Since 2012, fossil fuel and resources industries have donated over $7½ million to both of the big parties. That industry in return gets $6 billion a year in tax subsidies. We call them 'fossil fuel subsidies', and they are things like accelerated depreciation, cheaper diesel fuel—perks, if you like, that ordinary drivers and other sorts of companies do not get access to. That's a pretty good return on investment. That's about $2,000 in subsidies for every dollar that they donate. Generous donations have also bought them a government that is completely paralysed by the phrase 'climate change' and certainly paralysed by the phrase 'climate emergency', despite the bushfires that this country just experienced being the worst in our long history.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It won't surprise you that the gas industry donates millions of dollars. So it was of course no surprise that the Prime Minister appointed a whole lot of his gas mates to the national COVID commission who have, unsurprisingly, recommended support for their own projects. So we now have this spurious notion of a 'gas led recovery', when everyone can see that has increased gas prices, leading to a suppression of domestic manufacturing, and, because of the government's laser-like focus on doing favours for their mates, that has escaped the government's notice. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Banking and finance have also been serial offenders. They have donated about $60 million since 2012 to both sides of politics. Boy, didn't they buy them a long reprieve! Finally, after many years of the Greens pushing for it, we got a banking royal commission, but that industry's donations bought them many, many years of getting away with atrocious, unethical, immoral and illegal conduct. Finally, after many years of pushing, the royal commission has exposed that conduct, but one wonders whether $60 million bought them a few years of that continued bad behaviour not being sanction properly by those in charge. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The gambling industry is another huge donor to both state and federal political parties. You can see the evidence of what that donation delivers: strong support for pokies around Australia. ClubsNSW are huge donors to the Liberal Party. In particular, very generous donations now flow from ClubsNSW to the Liberal Party, after some attempt at gambling reform, by the member for Denison, Andrew Wilkie,  which sadly went nowhere. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They are only the donations that we know about. We know that there are vast amounts of donations—dark money, if you like—that aren't required to be disclosed because our disclosure rules are terribly weak. Part of the intention of these amendments today is to capture some of those lobster lunches, some of those pay-for-access meetings, that seem so routine, even though it is disgusting. We would redefine 'gift' to include party membership fees of over $1,000. At the moment, they are excluded. We would redefine 'gift' to include those pay-for-access functions, those forums, those subscription fees to various party subgroups, which at the moment our electoral laws do not include as disclosable. In fact, even the Electoral Commission recognises some uncertainty in terms of the mark-up on various corporate lunches; that was discussed yesterday. Even the AEC has acknowledged that the drafting there is so unclear that often with those sorts of events you can get away with not disclosing them, and some of the big parties do just that. The Minerals Council—old friends of ours!—donate $25,000 to each major party's such forum, and that entitles them to two boardroom events and two policy briefing sessions. At the minute, there's no restriction on that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So these amendments seek to redefine that definition of 'gift' to ensure that those things are disclosable. But then, because we cap donations at $1,000, you would not be able to donate those whopping amounts to get that special access that no other ordinary Australian gets. So we would seek to clean up those lobster lunches.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've talked about the bans we want to see on property developers, banks, tobacco, alcohol, gambling, big mining, defence and big pharma. We know this has routinely been before the courts and has been found to be perfectly lawful. I want to commend some of the state governments for taking steps in this regard. New South Wales, in particular, has been at the front of the pack on donations reform, pushed by our state Greens there, of course, for many years. Even Queensland has come on board, thanks again to political pressure exerted by my party to include a property developer ban under our state laws.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But it's nowhere near enough. We still have massive donations from big oil, big coal and big gas. In a climate crisis, they're still trying to buy the denial of the parties in government or those seeking to be in government. Meanwhile, the rest of the community suffers. We need climate action and we need policies that help people, not boost corporate profits. Part of the reason why we have such poor decision-making out of the federal parliament is that those donors get more influence than they should. Their interests get weighed in policy decisions when in fact we should be progressing the public interest, protecting nature and setting us all up for a prosperous and healthy future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So this is the amendment the Greens are seeking to move today. It's not the first time we've raised this issue. This has been a longstanding Greens policy. I'm not expecting to get support from the Labor or Liberal parties, who have taken in that $100 million in corporate donations since 2012. They're quite happy with that arrangement, and I'm sure they want to keep seeing the money flowing. They had a chance to vote for lower disclosure thresholds. They didn't do so. They have a chance today to vote to clean up the dirty donations. I'm not expecting them to do so. But the Greens will not give up. We will keep pushing these issues, because democracy belongs to the community. Politicians should not be for sale. I commend this amendment to the chamber.</span>

The Greens amendment would arbitrarily ban eight different specific categories of businesses from participating in the democratic process—eight different specific categories of legal, lawful businesses. Amongst the businesses that the Greens seek to ban are pharmaceutical companies. At the very time when these companies are alleviating suffering and helping to address the strains of a global health pandemic, the Greens want to stigmatise them by labelling them as a 'dirty industry', quite a disgraceful description of an extremely important sector of our economy and an important sector in our community, supporting public health. It's unbelievable that the Greens would come in here and seek to stigmatise such an important sector of our economy in that fashion. To be very clear, this ban which the Greens are proposing would hit companies that conduct pharmaceutical research and testing of medical cures, the sorts of companies that are at the forefront of fighting diseases.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendment also raises obvious questions over the constitutionality of such proposals given that the High Court has clearly stated in recent cases that donation bans could fail where they are not reasonably necessary and they impermissibly burden the implied freedom of political communication. The amendment also proposes a donation cap on $3,000. Those capping provisions cover donations for various political actors, including a state branch of a political party. But the amendment overlooks that some parties also have territory organisations. So, even putting policy preferences to one side, this is not a thoroughly thought through and well-drafted amendment and the government will oppose it.</span>

I know that because my very good friend Lee Rhiannon, who is no longer in this House, was so outraged by the hypocrisy of the Greens on these matters that she ghost-wrote a poisoned letter attacking the Greens leadership at the time, so we know that the Greens are hypocritical on this. They tell us today that they want to remove big money from political donations. Well, lovely objective, but let's talk about Duncan Turpie, a reclusive Queensland mathematician, investor and high-end gambler—high-end gambler! I can't quite remember all of the categories that the Greens want to ban but I do think gambling was one of them. How much big money— </span>

                    </a>  There is more, Senator Bilyk. What about the Western Australian Greens convenor Chilla Bulbeck, who personally donated $600,000 to the Greens at the last election? Now, maybe the Greens don't think $600,000 is big money and maybe they're not people the Greens are hoping to catch in this piece of legislation, but there are just three examples that I know of showing how hypocritical the Greens are on these issues.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We do believe in reform and we believe in practical results. When the Labor Party started campaigning at the last election for the end of foreign political donations, everyone said: 'No, you can't do it. You won't be able to achieve it. You're in opposition; the government will stymie you.' I have to say, we didn't get very much support from the Greens on that issue, but we persisted. We argued and argued, and what did we get? We got a bill that banned political donations before the last election. So for the first time in Australian political history foreign political donations were banned in this country. The former foreign minister couldn't rake in all that money while she was the foreign minister. I'm talking about Ms Bishop. She couldn't rake in all those foreign donations to the Liberal Party as she had done in previous elections. I'm not just picking on the Greens, Senator Waters. I'm equally having a go at the government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So there's plenty of hypocrisy around on these issues, but the Labor Party has got runs on the board. We've pushed for the issues and we've had the outcome. The offer I make to you, Senator Waters—because I checked again last night; there hadn't been any calls from the Greens about your amendments—is that we're very happy to talk to you about a practical outcome in political reform, because the Labor Party believes in it and, more importantly, the Labor Party has achieved it. If you sit down with us and Senator Patrick, Senator Lambie and Senator Griff then we can get practical results, but this is not the way to do it. Grandstanding—making this the last item on the list, trying to get a bit of cheap publicity—is not the way to do it. You've got to be serious about it. You've got to start at the beginning and, as we've done in the past, you'll get the results.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WATERS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Australian Greens in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:53</span>):  [by video link] I'll just take the opportunity to respond to some of that. I think Senator Farrell may be a bit disappointed that I didn't telephone him. I'm sorry; I went to the leader of your party in this chamber. I didn't get a reply, unfortunately.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to address some of the other issues that were raised. The government is trying to turn this amendment into something that it's not. I thought that was quite a heroic reinterpretation by Senator Cormann of these amendments that would stop big industries seeking to buy influence from political parties. Senator Cormann tried to recast it as restricting the operations of pharmaceutical companies. I'm very happy for them to continue with their work; in fact, they should not have been sold off in the first place. We'd like to see public pharmaceutical production, but I think that's, sadly, a bridge too far for this government, because it loves privatisation. It's not a restriction on their operations; we just don't think that they should be funding your political party. We don't think they should be funding anybody's political party. They should be spending their money on trying to help people. I thought it important to clarify that heroic attempt at a reframe by Senator Cormann.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And then, sadly, we had a bit of an attempt at a patronising lecture on hypocrisy, which didn't really land, from the Labor Party. This is the party that yesterday had a private member's bill for a $1,000 disclosure threshold and then voted against the Greens amendment to do just that in a manner which had exactly the same drafting as their own private member's bill. I think it's rich to be dishing out contentions of hypocrisy when you just voted against your own private member's bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Farrell then sought to impugn several individuals who have supported the Greens in the past. I point out that none of those people—not companies but individuals—sought to exert policy influence, nor did they receive any policy influence. The distinction there is that our policies aren't for sale. Yes, we do want to cap big donations like that going forward. Yes, we do think that would be an improvement on democracy, and we're prepared to cop it, just like we think all of you should cop it. So, again, I really didn't feel like the attack from Senator Farrell landed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Lastly, Senator Farrell championed the ending of foreign donations. He knows as well as I do that there are so many back doors in that legislation that foreign companies can still donate through an Australian subsidiary, a loophole the Greens sought to close with our amendments to that bill. I'll have to check the record, but I'm hazarding a guess that the Labor Party didn't support those amendments either. Again, I think it's a bit rich to get lectures doled out from people who don't have very clean hands in this regard.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With those offences addressed, I again commend these amendments to the chamber.</span>

Minister, you might recall that I asked what the burden difference was, or how you justify not supporting disclosure of donations above $1,000 versus above $14,300. That was just to understand what the burden was. You very helpfully—thank you—directed me to section 314AEB of the Commonwealth Electoral Act. I had a look at that last night, and it appears to me that the only burden in terms of making a donation above the threshold is simply to fill in this form. This form just requires you to put your name, your address, the political party you're donating to and how much it is. Is that the extent of the burden that you think justifies such a high threshold, or have I missed something?</span>

It makes very small entities that are not geared up for this liable to public exposure and potential threats from other actors in this process. Again, I've said consistently for some time now that we believe the current threshold is appropriate. It's an appropriate balance between facilitating participation in a democratic process and ensuring that the public interest of appropriate disclosure is maintained. Senator Lambie quite accurately related a private conversation that I had with her this week. It's just an observation of fact. Small-business people making small donations to our side of politics do feel intimidated by some of the consequences that come, as a result of that donation, from other very passionate and committed actors supporting a different side of politics. We don't believe people who are supporting their team or party of choice at that level should be exposed to that. People who participate at a more significant level, of course, need to be able to justify what they do in a public sense, and there is the appropriate disclosure and transparency requirement there. But we believe that the threshold where it currently is is appropriate.</span>

I appreciate that we don't want people threatened, but it is a democracy and the general principle in a democracy is we do have the ability to express our views. I would think that authorities would clamp down pretty hard on someone who acted in a threatening way towards, in my opinion, anyone who simply expressed their political view. So I really question your concern there. In particular, when you talk about making a mistake on this form, it's pretty hard to mess up your name, your address, the political party and the amount. You talk about risk, that risk must be so small that it couldn't in any reasonable circumstance be considered to be a burden in any way, shape or form. I don't want to verbal you in some way. But that's what you got to do, you've just got to fill in the form with some very simple details. Perhaps, Minister, you could tell me how many people have been brought to a court, or to a tribunal, on the basis that they didn't fill the form in right?</span>

I think that Senator Patrick and I, on behalf of the government, will just have to agree to disagree. We have a different view. We believe that we need to appropriately balance people's rights to participate in the democratic process, including by supporting financially the political party or the candidates that they would like to see elected at an election, and it is important to have appropriate transparency and disclosure arrangements in place. We believe the current arrangements work well and appropriately balance these two objectives.</span>

One Nation is not going to change whether this bill gets passed or not, because it has been agreed upon by both Liberal and Labor. It will be passed. We're talking about donations under $14,000.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In reference to what Senator Rex Patrick has said, I, unlike the majority of people in the chamber, run my own political party and have done since 1997. The fact is that over the years One Nation has been tagged as a racist party, with policies that mean people possibly don't want to be associated with the party, but they support the party, and this happens in all political parties. When you put in a donation over $14,000 you have to list your name and your address. A lot of people these days support political parties. That's their privacy. If they donate $1,000 or $2,000 they can donate that and it means that they don't have to disclose their name or address. A lot of people may work for organisations, even government departments, where if it is seen that they have donated to a political party they're in fear of losing their jobs. There is a lot of concern from these people. It is a privacy matter. It's like when they go to vote, no-one knows how they vote. But it is disclosed if they donate to a political party. So it is a privacy matter and it does concern a lot of people.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Most of the donations that we get for One Nation are not big donations at all. It's the mums and dads. I thank those people who do support my policies for their donations. They have a right to privacy. If you reduce that amount to under $14,000 these people will not be donating. In some small way it enables us to do the job that we do to give them that representation in parliament by getting people elected to parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Do I agree with big donations from some of these companies, organisations and banks to the major political parties? No, I don't. I don't agree to foreign donations to the Greens, because I then question why international donations would be coming to the Greens in Australia other than to control the way they vote in this country. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So a lot of corruption has happened over the years. I think that the disclosure of over $14,000 is at the right place. That's why I do not support the Greens amendment to reduce the disclosure to $1,000. I do question why the Greens say in their amendment that they have no intention of saying that people should show identification at polling booths. That's all I have to say on the matter. That's my reasoning behind why I don't support disclosure.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:05</span>):  I have a short set of questions before I conclude, just as a follow-up from yesterday, but very directly related to the Greens' amendment now. Yesterday I was talking about dinner functions that are held by major parties where people are invited to attend a dinner with a member of the party present. They pay substantial amounts of money for the opportunity to do that, several thousand dollars in most instances. Yesterday I was discussing the arrangements in place for these things, and I just want to go back to the point I was making. Again, I'm not directing this at Senator Cormann because I think he's a lone fish in this pond; it's simply that he has knowledge of his own circumstances. There surely must be a concern if you invite people to attend a dinner that will be attended by the minister, as opposed to the senator, as, in some sense, you are drawing people into a room on the basis that you are a member of the executive, in order to benefit the political party that sits behind that minister. I know you understand the line that I'm drawing, Minister. Again, what are the policies in relation to that sort of conduct? And have you ever been at a dinner where the promotion of that dinner mentioned the fact that the attendees of the dinner would be meeting or dining with Minister Cormann or the Minister for Finance?</span>

This will be my final contribution on this point because I've well and truly addressed it. I confirmed yesterday on the record, and I confirm again, that in all of my capacities as a backbench senator, a shadow minister and now as a minister, I have attended wide range of functions, including campaign related fundraising events. That is part of our job. Clearly, in those circumstances, what guides all of us is that everything has to be lawful and, as a minister, everything has to be consistent with the requirements in the Statement of Ministerial Standards. I can, indeed, confirm that at all times any activity that I've been involved in has been compliant with those requirements.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Australian Greens in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:08</span>):  [by video link] Don't hold your breath on the ministerial standards, Senator Patrick. As we know, they're not independently enforced. They're completely at the whim of the Prime Minister. I digress.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On the issue that Minister Cormann yesterday attempted to allay concerns about, I think the issue remains: when it comes to the mark-up on a function above the cost of the actual meal, it is actually a grey area under our existing electoral laws, which is precisely why our amendment seeks to clarify that a gift includes such events. It's not just us who think it's a grey area. The Electoral Commission, when I previously asked them in estimates, said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The classic example we have is when a person attends a dinner where members of a political party or government may be present. Quite often the person who attended might regard it as a donation while the recipient might regard it as 'other'. That is one of the areas where the act is not clear, and it has been a longstanding issue. Again, it is something we attempt to address in the various guidelines that we publish on our website. But it is an issue. It is one of the reasons it is impossible to accurately match a particular donation with a particular receipt because quite often there is not a meeting of minds between the person who is making the payment and the recipient of the payment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is exactly why lobster lunches and pay-for-access meetings keep occurring and they're not transparently disclosed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to clarify the rules on when you've got to tell the public how much someone paid to go out to lunch, dinner or whatever it is with you and what exactly they get for their money. I reference a few contributions that the Minerals Council makes. They get two boardroom events and policy briefing sessions for their contribution of $25,000 to each of the larger political parties. So this is exactly why we need an amendment, such as the Greens one that's before us right now, to properly define 'gift' not only to include party membership fees of over $1,000—they're not included at the minute either; it's another convenient backdoor way of making extra donations—but to ensure that any of those subscriptions are disclosed. So I don't accept that Senator Cormann's view that this is already addressed by the electoral laws to be a correct representation. It is not clear. We have a chance to put it beyond doubt. I hope that addresses any of the questions that Senator Patrick might have about the dissatisfactory status of the current law.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I neglected to confirm in response to Senator Hanson that the Greens have not received foreign donations. I wanted to make sure the record was corrected there, because Senator Hanson got that wrong. I also note her comments about lowering the disclosure threshold. That was yesterday's amendment. As folk would know, the amendment that we're addressing at the minute is to cap donations to $1,000, to ban donations from those industries that have sought to exert undue influence and to clarify that definition of 'gift' so we can't have these shady pay-for-access occurrences continue. Just so everybody is clear, that's what we're voting on now. The disclosure threshold, which is Labor's policy that they voted against, happened yesterday.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government have indicated to the opposition that they want to see the citizenship cessation bill passed through the parliament before we leave this chamber this week. This is a bill that deals with terrorist conduct. This bill is an important national security bill. It is an important piece of national security legislation dealing with terrorist conduct and the removal of citizenship from dual citizens who engage in terrorist conduct. This is an important tool in our national security apparatus to ensure that our national security agencies have the capacity and the ability to remove dual citizenship from those dual citizens who engage in terrorist conduct.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a reform that is long overdue. The Independent National Security Legislation Monitor has recommended, in unequivocal terms, that the current model of citizenship loss be immediately repealed and revoked—that the automatic loss of citizenship for dual citizens who engage in terrorist conduct does not serve our national security interests. That is the recommendation of the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor. It is also the advice of ASIO. ASIO has advised the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security that the current law does not always serve the national interest, that the current law does not always provide the best outcome from a national security perspective.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government introduced this legislation in the House of Representatives some eight months ago. It went to an inquiry of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security. The PJCIS delivered its report on Tuesday, because the Minister for Home Affairs, Peter Dutton, had indicated to the opposition that the government would pass this legislation through the parliament this week—through all stages in both chambers. The government said it was incredibly important that we get this legislative reform done.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The opposition, the Australian Labor Party, supports this bill. We support this change. We have, at every juncture, provided support to the government to facilitate the passage of this legislation. In the House of Representatives, we indicated that we would be willing to interrupt legislation to bring this legislation on. The government did not take us up on that offer. However, yesterday, the bill did pass through the House of Representatives. We now only have hours to go before we leave Canberra for weeks. We will not be back here until October. This legislative reform, which deals with terrorist conduct by dual citizens, improves the process by which citizenship is taken away from Australian citizens who are dual citizens or who have a right to citizenship in another country. The process by which they lose their citizenship is improved in a way that ASIO wants, that the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor requested, which said it needed to be repealed, revoked and replaced with a decision-making model.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an important piece of national security legislation. It is an important tool for our national security agencies in safeguarding the Australian community from those who would seek to do us harm. By moving this suspension of standing orders, I send in the clearest possible terms a message to the Australian community and to members in this Senate that the Australian Labor Party stands ready to facilitate this legislation and ensure its passage through this chamber today so that when we leave this parliament—</span>

                  </a>  I note that there's laughter on the other side. Such is the disdain, apparently, some may have for our national security agencies and their legislation. What is serious about this bill is that ASIO has said it is important we get this done, so we are moving this suspension of standing orders to ensure that we have time in this chamber to debate and pass this important legislation.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Government in the Senate, Minister for Finance and Vice-President of the Executive Council</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:38</span>):  I have never seen such a self-indulgent stunt, wasting the Senate's time, in my entire career in this chamber. I have to tell you, after 13½ years in this chamber, that is the most self-indulgent, unproductive waste-of-time stunt from anyone on any side. You really take the cake. There's been some big competition, I have to tell you, but you really take the cake. This bill that Senator Keneally wants to bring on now is the next bill after the one that we're about to debate.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You are now wasting 30 minutes of the Senate's time, when we could have dispatched the Payment Times Reporting Bill 2020 and got into the Australian Citizenship Amendment (Citizenship Cessation) Bill 2020, important national security related legislation, which we introduced—it is our legislation—and which we want to be passed today. You are standing in the way of it being passed today. You are delaying the work of the Senate through your games—your self-indulgent, embarrassing, wasting-the-Senate's-time games. It's because it is all 'look at me'. This is the approach of these senators: 'Look at me. I have to make myself relevant. I have to get myself in the middle of this. I've got to make it look as if somehow I'm helping to facilitate this.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me tell you: I doubt that there will be many non-Labor senators who will be supporting this. I suspect that Labor senators will only support this stunt because they're bound by caucus rules. Otherwise, I would be very interested in what Senator O'Neill, for example, thinks about this particular self-indulgent stunt, and I'm very interested in what some of these other senators think about this self-indulgent stunt. Senator Keneally is disrupting the business of the Senate so that she can move the bill up by one in the order of business. Anybody who watches the operations of the Senate knows that, of course, in the ordinary course of events, we were going to get to this today; we were going to be able to pass it today. If the Labor Party really is serious about wanting to pass this, there is a constructive way to engage with the government—in the way that, quite frankly, we often do with the Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate—where we can put certain procedural arrangements in place to ensure that we don't leave tonight unless and until this particular legislation is passed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But—do you know what?—we've got two important pieces of legislation to deal with. We have the Payment Times Reporting Bill 2020 and the Payment Times Reporting (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2020 that need to be passed, and we need to, of course, deal with our reform in relation to Australian citizenship cessation arrangements, and this stunt by Senator Keneally has done nothing—nothing whatsoever—to facilitate their passage or to accelerate their passage. All it has done is delay their passage.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But what it has done, of course, is put a spotlight on Senator Keneally. Senator Keneally was hoping that it would put a positive spotlight on her. But, of course, all it has done is show everyone that in these sorts of matters it is always about Senator Keneally herself, personally. She wants to put herself into the limelight in a completely unproductive fashion. We are now wasting 30 minutes of the Senate's time because of this sort of completely unproductive and unnecessary attempt to disrupt the business of the Senate.</span>

We do not support the legislation. We don't want it brought forward, because we don't want it to pass. So, while we are about to vote with the government on this suspension, the reasons for the position that we are taking are very different from the reasons that the government is taking.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to take a very short opportunity to explain why it is that we don't support this legislation. Under this bill, the threshold for depriving dual nationals of citizenship on national security grounds will be lowered and there are inadequate protections provided to reduce and prevent the likelihood of people being made stateless. This legislation, should it pass, will mean that, with the stroke of a pen, the minister will be able to render people stateless. Labor is suggesting that its approach is in support of human rights. But make no mistake: because this bill will lower the threshold for determining dual citizenship and will provide inadequate protections against statelessness, this bill is actually contrary to Australia's human rights obligations. There is diminished judicial review, there is no merits review of ministerial decisions that may make people stateless and this legislation is inconsistent with Australia's international legal and human rights obligations.</span>

                  </a>  Well, if you had taken a look at the speaking list for the Payment Times Reporting Bill 2020, you would see that the bill, including the amendments, would take us up to 11.45, the hard marker. We were giving the government the opportunity to agree that this should be prioritised and dealt with, to make sure we got this done before other matters before the Senate today. That was the idea of Senator Keneally. That was the reason she moved this today. It's pretty straightforward. If the government wants this done and wants it guaranteed to be done, this is a sensible way of timetabling the program. We think there is a risk that it won't be done, because the payment times legislation does have a lot of speakers. There are amendments and it could take us up to the hard marker. That was the reason we did it. It's quite sensible. I don't think it needed that kind of response from the government, frankly, particularly on a bill that they want done. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator GRIFF</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:58</span>):  I rise to speak on the Payment Times Reporting Bill 2020 and the related bill. I spent a career working in and with small businesses and I understand how important they are for local economies and the national economy, and how difficult it can be to run a small business. Let me tell you, cash flow matters. It doesn't matter how good you are at what you do; if your customers don't pay on time, you simply cannot survive with a small business.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For small-business people, landing a contract with a large firm feels like you've made it. It gives you a kind of security that you don't have with other contracts—security that you've got a buyer for your products, security that you have money coming in, security that you can pay the salaries of the workers who are depending on you. But, once that feeling passes—and, believe me, that feeling generally passes very quickly—you learn that a contract with a large firm can also give you a very high degree of insecurity. If one-quarter or one-half of your business is with one customer, you are completely dependent on them. If they drop you or if they scale back, you have to let go of employees and you might even have to shut up shop. When you're dependent on one big customer and they tell you they're not going to pay their bills right away, you're in no position to argue or to renegotiate with them at all. They are the ones who hold all of the power.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will require those big customers to publicly report on their payment terms and their actual payment periods for their small business customers, and that is very much a good thing. At the very least, this will allow small businesses to check out the practices of potential larger customers and decide whether or not they're willing to take on that exposure. Of course, small businesses will take on that exposure regardless because they would see it as representing a large chunk of their business. It's going to be a useful tool for many businesspeople. The government also says that the register will create an incentive for large businesses to improve their payment performance. I'm somewhat sceptical about this for a number of reasons, but I do hope that, in the end, that will actually be of benefit to small businesses. The reason large businesses can push around small businesses is that there are plenty of small business suppliers but only a small number of large customers in any market. That's what gives the big players market power. Unless those power dynamics change, there won't be many big players changing their payment performance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Transparency alone will do little to make things better. Indeed, my main concern with this bill is that transparency may actually make things worse for some small businesses, particularly those in concentrated markets like the banks, petrol stations, supermarkets and telecommunications. The register will allow big businesses to see the payment terms of their competitors, which is something that, I think, very few people have thought about. Moreover, it will allow some of the better performers to scale back their payment terms in a race to the bottom that can only hurt small business. Unfortunately, I don't see a way to amend these bills so that we can capture the benefits of transparency without incurring the harm. The benefits outweigh the harm, so Centre Alliance will support this legislation, but reluctantly. We encourage government to look at this as one step in a journey towards making life easier for small-business people. This means adopting some of the other recommendations of the small business ombudsman, such as the regulation of the use of supply chain finance products. But, more than anything, we need to find ways of dealing with a market power enjoyed by too many large businesses in Australia. Market power hurts small businesses, and it also hurts consumers and employees. If the government is serious about a productivity based recovery, market power itself is where the government needs to focus.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="144292" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator PATRICK</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:06</span>):  I rise to speak on this bill, the Payment Times Reporting Bill 2020. I note that on 28 November 2018, at the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry annual dinner, the Prime Minister announced as part of a strategy to assist smaller businesses that cash-flow measures would be introduced. He said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Cash flow always starts with getting paid. If the invoices you issue are not being paid, that hurts your business, that makes it harder for your business. Businesses, small businesses should never be treated as a bank by governments or large businesses. We should all pay on time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">He then spoke of the government's track record on payments and plans to get Commonwealth payments down to 20 days, something he clearly expected to flow further into the supply chain when he said that—so, when the government pays primes, we want to make sure that payments make their way to smaller businesses more quickly. He also said this:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">What we have said is that anyone who wants to work with the Commonwealth Government, you've got to agree to those terms as well. You've got to pay businesses on time, because the quicker the money moves around, the better the economy does, it's just common sense. So we are working to deliver that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We are also requiring that more businesses with a 100 million turnover, that's 3,000 business to publish information on how they pay their small businesses. I want to see the score board. You need to see the score board if you are a small or family business. Who are the big businesses that pay on time?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All good words that were coming from the Prime Minister, and I note that the number has now changed in respect of reporting. We do need to make sure that we move to a situation where you are not in a position to get a government contract if you don't pay businesses on time. I have written to Minister Cormann recently about this, because it's within his portfolio responsibility, and he assures me that the government is moving down that particular pathway—although in my view not quickly enough, and in Kate Carnell's view, too, not quickly enough.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The federal government generally does pay well. The old system directs suppliers be paid within 30 to 45 days. I note Defence, for example, has really stepped this up during COVID and are paying suppliers within two to seven days, but not always. So we've got some good things coming out of COVID in respect of government making payments on time, and I congratulate the government on those. But I do throw out this concern. Whilst the government is paying people very quickly as a result of COVID—large defence companies—and that initially started with very short payment times to the small businesses, that has, apparently, turned around. And so I'd just draw the government's attention to the fact that, whilst it is doing the right thing, some large defence contractors are not.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That kind of frames where we are as this bill lands in the Senate today. There is other stuff the government is doing. I could sit here and say, 'You're not doing enough. You're not going fast enough,' and I think those words are true, but at least you are looking at the problem.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Kate Carnell, the small business ombudsman, said in February this year:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">…late payments by large businesses to small businesses account for 53 per cent of all invoices; that's $115 billion paid late to small businesses – equivalent to $7 billion of working capital to Australian small businesses every year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So this is really important legislation, focusing on reporting payment times to small businesses with a turnover of more than $10 million.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst I'll be supporting this legislation, I will also be supporting Labor's amendments that place legal obligations on companies to pay small businesses on time. The time has come to stop large businesses using small companies as banks. That is just not an acceptable proposition. It causes great harm. It causes great stress to business owners, as Senator Griff was talking about. It causes companies to not have the cash flow to grow their own businesses. It's effectively removing money from local economies and that is simply not acceptable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to use this opportunity to present a particular concern that I have, and this is something that the people of small businesses of Whyalla have talked to me on a number of occasions. I have been up to Whyalla to talk about this issue in December 2018, January 2019, April 2019, June 2019, November 2019, March 2020 and August 2020. Just recently I was up visiting my brother in Whyalla and took the opportunity to talk to local businesses again. There's a problem up there. The problem relates to the steelworks. The steelworks up there has been in significant financial difficulty for years. It was given a potential lifeline in 2017 when British billionaire Sanjeev Gupta bought the steelworks and unveiled a multimillion dollar redevelopment. Much of this is still to happen.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">People will remember there was a fairly serious crisis on our hands, because if, indeed, the Whyalla steelworks were to close it would basically bring the city to its knees. We might recall that Mark Mentha was engaged as the administrator. We originally saw Mr Mentha making a decision for a South Korean company to take over the Whyalla steelworks. That didn't work out. Mr Gupta stepped in. Generally he's well regarded around town—although some of that regard is wearing off. As part of the arrangements that were put in place, the South Australian government—that was then Labor—made a funding commitment. I note that the current Treasurer, the Hon. Rob Lucas, said that he would honour that commitment. There are conditions associated with it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the meantime, what's happening is Mr Gupta is travelling around the world and he's buying up a whole range of steel related industries, many of them that are in distress. While he's doing that he's leaving people in Whyalla unpaid—good businesses run by good people who carry out good work, either producing good products or providing good services. He's contracting them. They carry out the work and then they don't get paid on time. His payment terms are quite lengthy already, but he's not meeting those. Mr Gupta, as much as I support you in terms of your ambitions for Whyalla—you'll see no-one standing closer to you when you advocate for support for your plans, because it will transform Whyalla from a city of 22,000 to a city of 80,000. It will be the cause of dual carriageways all the way to Whyalla. We'll see desalination plants. We'll see 737s flying in and out of Whyalla to and from Brisbane, Sydney and Melbourne. I did talk about this on Tuesday night and in a previous speech. It's very important. I absolutely support what Mr Gupta is planning for Whyalla, but you can't continue to do what you are doing to the businesses of Whyalla.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's well over $1 million owed to small businesses in Whyalla, and it is causing great distress. Remember that many of these businesses were receiving the same treatment as they are receiving now when Arrium were running the company. It's been a long-term hard slog for these people. It's lucky we have tough people in steel towns, but it's not good enough. We have to do something about it. I want GFG to succeed, but they have to be good corporate citizens, and, right now, they are not. It is unacceptable. Mr Gupta, you need to step up and you need to pay.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Big businesses are much better positioned to predict their cashflow. They can see what money is coming in and what money is coming out, and they should never put themselves in a position where they place an order on a small business with the knowledge that they simply won't be able to pay that provider. What we see in many instances, because these businesses are in a distressed state, is that these companies then often come up to the smaller business and say, 'If you want to get paid on time, you need to trim your price, and we'll give you a guarantee that you'll get paid on time.' That's totally unacceptable conduct.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In some sense, it's a bit of a sad indictment that we have to legislate like we are today. I support the idea that we should be reporting companies that are not paying on time. I think, when you shine a light on things, often you get improvements. They say that the thing that people who operate in dark places fear the most is light, so we do need to shine a light on some of these companies that are simply doing the wrong thing, and that's why this bill is important. But I think we need to go a step further.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to push forward with punitive measures where businesses do not comply with payment times. Remember: these payment times are an agreement between two parties—between the large business and the small business. No-one forces anyone to do this, and so one expects that you go into these arrangements in good faith and in good conscious. Provided one party meets their side of the agreement, the other party must also meet theirs. So I support this bill, but I also support what Labor are trying to do with this, and that is to make sure that there are penalties associated with large businesses who don't conduct their business in a conscionable fashion. I commend the bill to the Senate.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:18</span>):  I rise to speak in support of the Payment Times Reporting Bill 2020 and the Payment Times Reporting (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2020. In my previous life at the Transport Workers Union of Australia, the largest organisation representing small businesses in Australia—namely, the thousands of owner-drivers in the country—I frequently dealt with the ongoing issue of payment delays. The committee reviewing this bill heard evidence that 98 per cent of trucking operators are small or family businesses. Many operate with tight margins, often under incredible pressure, with high upfront costs, ongoing debt and unsafe working conditions. These conditions are made all the worse by the repeated behaviour of retail and mining clients at the top of the supply chain who are pushing out payment times, often resulting in these small businesses waiting 60 days, 90 days or even 120 days plus. Truck drivers and their companies are not like publicly listed companies. They cannot borrow at the rates the larger companies can. They cannot sell equities or issue debt bonds when they're not paid on time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When the client at the top of the supply chain, often with millions of dollars in financial and legal assets behind them, decides not to pay, what recourse does a contractor or owner-operator have? What recourse does this bill propose to allow them? Nothing. The bill will require companies with turnovers greater than $100 million to report twice yearly how regularly they pay their companies and contractors. We understand that will be roughly 3,000 Australian businesses, which is a drop in the ocean of the number of companies that need to be held to account for payment times.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's Xero 2019 report that prompted the bill estimated that late payments from big businesses cost our small businesses up to $7 billion a year. We know from the 2016 research by Dunn &amp; Bradstreet Australia that large companies in Australia can be 20 per cent slower in paying their bills than smaller companies. The Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman in 2017, inquiring into payment times and practices, found that average agreement payment times in Australia were 26 days late.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Only significantly large companies that regularly pay late, creating cashflow problems for small businesses, will be, under this bill, effectively named and shamed for their behaviour. This bill is a positive step in that regard, but one that will create some minimal transparency around this practice. Where this bill fails is that it relies entirely on this name-and-shame tactic to drive change. Similar programs in other parts of the world have fundamentally failed. This bill can really be described as a 'no-help no-harm' bill. It provides no actual help for small business and causes no harm to the larger businesses who do the wrong thing. The bill does not mandate or enforce maximum payment times. Instead, this government's relying on companies to have an ounce of shame or regret in how they treat others in their supply chain. It is really optimistic, as corporate self-regulation always is.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman, Ms Carnell, told the committee that reviewed this bill—and I'm quoting from the report:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… some large firms simply ignore bad publicity about their practices.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why Labor will be proposing its own amendment to this bill to provide a fail-safe against late payments, an amendment that will deliver greater financial security and certainty to small business. While those opposite often trumpet that they are the party of small business, when it comes to actually ensuring fairness for small businesses the Liberal Party instead side with the largest of companies. As for the Nationals, I hope they will follow suit in the spirit of the great National senator John Williams, who backed the 30-day maximum payment system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In some markets and industries, small businesses cannot shop around for other clients or other work because the market power is held by the top of the supply chain. Moreover, naming and shaming businesses with bad payment times will likely do nothing to stop the market power exercised by these firms, and that's the experience overseas. Small businesses already know which companies are good or bad operators. If Aldi builds a reputation for not paying contractors or small businesses in its supply chain, does that erode any of its market power to set the rates in the supply chain and continue its practice? The answer is: of course not. This bill on its own will do nothing to prevent these companies from riding roughshod over smaller operations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill in its current form will also do nothing about the disturbing trend of supply chain financing, where small businesses are forced to engage a third-party financier to pay invoices owed to them, often for free. This is a process that sees desperate small businesses at their wit's end taken advantage of by these financiers, essentially payday lenders for small business. They're losing money in order to be paid on time. Big businesses and companies that never seem to have a problem paying their executive bonuses or their shareholder dividends can for some reason rarely be bothered to pay those in the supply chain on time. The practice of supply chain financing is unacceptable and a by-product of this government's failure to curb the practice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are 3.4 small businesses in Australia, many suffering the consequences of intermittent cash flow due to a delay in payment times. Instead of telling them what they already know, this government could take decisive action and mandate a maximum 30-day payment—a mandate that should not result in companies that pay in less than 30 days pushing out their payment times but, instead, ensure that companies practise payment times that treat others in their supply chain fairly. A 30-day maximum payment mandate is a proposal backed by the Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman, the Institute of Public Accountants, Self-Employed Australia and, in a rare moment of unity, the Australian Trucking Association. As the ATA made clear in their submission on this bill, late payments are a chronic problem in the road transport industry, and there is a great deal that the government could to.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, I will not hold my breath, because it was this government, only one Prime Minister ago, that abolished the Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal. The tribunal was brought in because the client economic pressure at the top of the supply chain is overwhelmingly the biggest factor contributing to the high rates of injuries, deaths and collapsed companies in the trucking industry. And poor payment terms are one of many features of this gross economic power that are strangling the transport supply chain. This was a finding of the National Transport Commission's 2008 report:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… the overwhelming weight of evidence indicates that commercial/industrial practices affecting road transport play a direct and significant role in causing hazardous practices.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is a finding that had been confirmed by countless inquiries, reviews and reports, including coroners' reports.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Legislating the Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal was a shining achievement of the Gillard government. It took action to support the tens of thousands of small businesses operating in the road transport industry. The tribunal's first order—yes, the very first order—issued in December 2019 mandated 30-day payments. If this government had not abolished the tribunal in 2016 then 30-day payment times would be the law of the road transport industry. Countless small businesses might not have gone bankrupt waiting for payment of their invoices. Drivers would have been able to maintain their vehicles and not suffer the indignity of injury or, of course, the tragedy of their death for their families and friends. The government abolished that tribunal and replaced it with nothing, and they're replacing it with nothing now. They repealed a body that was providing safety, ensuring that small businesses were paid on time, and replaced it with nothing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In preparation for this speech I reached out to industry leaders, including Peter Anderson of the Victorian Transport Association and Hugh McMaster of the New South Wales branch of the Australian Road Transport Industry Organisation and the Transport Workers Union, and asked them questions about late payments. I was informed that among eight companies that were surveyed in the past 24 hours there were 23 invoices already 60 days late on payment, six invoices 45 days late, two invoices 90 days late and five invoices that are now 120 days late—all from clients of major companies that are serviced by the transport industry, many of them servicing multinationals. Some of these clients even have the audacity to ask for discounts in exchange for improved payment times, let alone payment on time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the state of the industry post the repeal of the Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal as described by Frank Black, a representative for owner-drivers who contributed to a 2017 report; Macquarie University Associate Professor Louise Thornthwaite; and Sharron O'Neill of the University of New South Wales. Frank Black described the effect of repealing the tribunal as follows:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Things are going backwards and the pressure on drivers is growing. The Government can't be surprised at the high number of deaths and injuries on the roads.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman, in their September 2016 review into the RSRT, examined the issue of payment times and terms and talked to owner-operators in the industry. One driver remarked: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">BP requires me to pay my fuel bill at least fortnightly. But I can wait up to four months to be paid for my work. That means I often have to pay for fuel with a credit card.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another driver pointed out:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Cash flow is the most important weapon with small business, it ensures accounts are paid on time, financial security. Many large companies are pushing their payments out to 60 and 90 days. No-one can survive with those sorts of terms. Fuel, wages, superannuation all have to be paid within a 30 day period.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These drivers raise an important point: there is one practice for small business and another for their clients. Small business cannot afford to miss payments to their suppliers. Delays can put them out of business, while the clients—the ones that have the market power and supply chains—can do what they want. Transport companies are not price makers; they are price takers. They are at the mercy of the client's gross economic power.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As an official with the TWU for 30 years, I've heard what that pressure sounds like. It's the pressure of struggling to make ends meet while an owner-operator goes 100 days without payment for his or her work. It's postponing overdue maintenance on your vehicle in order to make those ends meet. It's burning the midnight oil driving through the night to make an extra delivery—an extra run to earn just a little more. And it's the sound of carnage on our roads. Since the Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal was abolished, there have been some 706 deaths from accidents involving heavy vehicles.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While passing this bill won't do any harm, if the government is serious about addressing payment times to improve fairness for businesses at the mercy of powerful clients, to stop the callous practices of those at the top of the transport supply chains and to ease the financial pressures that contribute to deaths on our roads, then it should listen to the industry, the drivers and the opposition and support our amendments. As I've said before, I reach out to the Nationals in particular, and I will reincarnate, in senatorial terms, Senator 'Wacka' Williams: get off your backsides; do the right thing; turn around and support small businesses in your regions and in your towns. Yes, many of them are trucking businesses, but many are in the supply chains of those retailers—those ruthless operators—and non-mandated requirements on codes and nonarbitration are screwing them every day of the week. Stand with all of us—stand with the opposition and, most importantly, stand with your constituency.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator POLLEY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:32</span>):  I'd like to align myself with the comments in the contribution that Senator Sheldon has just made. I rise too to speak on the Payment Times Reporting Bill 2020 and the Payment Times Reporting (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2020. I want to say at the outset that without amendments to this bill, and specifically the payment times reporting scheme, this bill should not be supported.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Payment Times Reporting Bill introduces a new payment times reporting scheme which requires approximately 3,000 large businesses and government enterprises with annual turnover of $100 million and above to publicly report biannually on their payment terms and practices for their small business suppliers. It's an important piece of legislation if we are to get Australia moving again. After all, businesses, and in particular small businesses, are the backbone of Australia's economy. Labor understands that the policy to ensure these small businesses are supported is important work of government. There is no more important time than right now as we are emerging out of the health pandemic and the economic recession that we have found ourselves in.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Small businesses in Tasmania are the backbone of our state's economy. There are over 40,000 businesses in our community, and 95 per cent of those small businesses employ, on average, between one and 19 employees. These businesses are made up of local people; they deserve our support, because we are a close-knit community that supports one another. As we emerge from this crisis, it is crucial we support local small businesses in our cities, suburbs and regions. It would be really good if the Department of Finance, for instance, ensured that electorate office accounts were paid in a more timely manner, because many of those are local small businesses. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The objective of the scheme outlined in the bill is to improve payment outcomes for small businesses by creating transparency around payment practices of large business entities. The government argues that, by providing access to information on large business payment performance, small businesses will be able to make more-informed decisions about potential customers. The government argues that greater transparency on payment practices and performance will also create pressure for culture change to improve payment times. The opposition agrees. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government-chaired Senate Standing Committee on Education and Employment handed down its report on 30 July, and it recommended passage of the bill with the additional recommendation of a statutory review after two years. The report included additional comments by Labor senators, drawing attention to the majority of witness testimonies to the Senate committee arguing that the bill will not have a tangible effect on reducing payment times from large businesses to small businesses. As stated earlier, this bill should not be simply waved through without amendments that change the Payment Times Reporting Scheme. As noted by Labor senators, the Payment Times Reporting Scheme is in reality a transparency initiative to support self-regulation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The efficiency of self-regulatory regimes is usually poor to questionable unless backed by the genuine threat of heavy-handed regulation. In principle, the transparency regime should be given a limited time to demonstrate its efficiency. Labor senators are of the belief that complementary back-up measures are necessary to ensure that the Payment Times Reporting Scheme improves general payment times to small businesses. The committee's evidence was consistent. Most witnesses argued for mandated 30-day payment times, or clarification that the object of the bill was to achieve payment times of 30 days or less. These witnesses were not any old witnesses. They were witnesses that those opposite should be listening to. You don't reform without consultation with a sector or with the Australian people. That is when policy fails. That is something this government just doesn't understand, because they don't like to hear an argument that they don’t agree with. These stakeholders included the Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman, the Australian Trucking Association, the Australian Institute of Public Accountants, Self-Employed Australia, and Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand. These are informed witnesses. They deal with these practices every day. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know the world over that self-regulation does not work, and certainly business is not going to start self-regulating during a global pandemic, when budgets are weakening, investment is low, business confidence is low and wages are stagnating—they were before the pandemic. Many people are in insecure work, and that has only increased due to the pandemic and the government's policies. Labor supports accountability and transparency measures. Without them, we cannot support these bills. So we are urging the government, the crossbench and the Nationals. The Nationals come into this chamber, day in and day out, talking about regional Australia. They should be standing with us and supporting our amendments. That is what is in the interests of small businesses around the country, but particularly those in regional areas of this country and in my home state of Tasmania. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The payment times fail-safe mechanism, by introducing the following features, is intended to provide an incentive for reporting entities to collectively improve their payment practices or run the risk of more stringent regulation. The regulator is required to report to the minister, after each reporting period after the first three reporting periods, on the median and average times taken by all reporting entities to pay small businesses' invoices. The reports are to be tabled in both houses of parliament. The payment times fail-safe mechanism is triggered if, after the first six reporting periods, the median time, reported by all reporting entities, to pay small-business invoices for a reporting period is more than 30 days. The regulator must report these factors to the minister.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've talked in this chamber, over the past two weeks that we've been here, about the true impact of the pandemic both from a health point of view and from an economic point of view. We've seen the recent figures which, unfortunately, see us plummeting into recession. The last 29 years of growth in this country have now been set aside for the worst recession I've seen in my lifetime, and a lot of that rests with the government and the decisions that they've been making. Firstly, they should support our amendments. Secondly, they should ensure that government agencies are using best practice by ensuring that they pay their accounts within that 30-day period. Many of them, as I've outlined before, are with small business as well as with larger businesses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If we are to work together, we will see better practices throughout the country. The first instance of this is those opposite, the government, supporting our amendments, if they truly want to make this bill work more effectively and see transparency. If they won't support them then we call on the Nationals to do the right thing. It was interesting to hear Senator Sheldon, in his contribution, refer to former senator 'Wacka' Williams. He was a straight shooter. He knew what was needed in the regions in his home state and around the country. So I'm calling on Nationals senators to get with the program and support our amendments.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Because the interim Commissioner (as announced February 5 2020) has yet to be appointed, the interim Commissioner's literature review, also announced in February, is also yet to commence. This review, consisting of a comprehensive review of known current and former ADF and Defence personnel suicides since 2001, as well as a progress update on the implementation of recommendations made in various reviews and reports since 2003, should be concluded to inform the design of the National commissioner's proposed functioning.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The expectation offered by the Government in February 2020 was that the interim Commissioner would produce an initial report back twelve months from commencement, with a final report due 18 months from commencement (or six months after the initial reporting date). As this has been delayed, it is reasonable to suggest that the work of the interim Commissioner should inform the consideration of the Senate committee, and such that the work of the interim Commissioner should be allowed to proceed without delay, and without undue haste. The 12-month timeline to produce an initial report should be honoured.</span>

We don't think a reporting date next year is appropriate, because it would delay the establishment of this very important standing commission with the powers of a royal commission. I would also like to announce on behalf of the government that we intend to make an announcement in relation to the appointment of a commissioner during the month of September.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:48</span>):  I say to the government, look, it's as simple as this: you were going to put an interim commissioner in early this year. We are still waiting for you to do that. We still do not know who the interim commissioner is. We are now sitting in September and we've got no idea what you are doing or who it is, and there are no terms of reference. You've got a real problem here. What we're asking is: when that is done, can we overview that and have an inquiry, and watch this going through? I can tell you, you are the same government that still has not responded to the recommendations of the Productivity Commission. What is wrong with you people? My thought is this: the only way you could come up with this is one of two ways. You are using information from the exact same people who are pushing these veterans to suicide—that is, the Department of Defence and the Department of Veterans' Affairs. I can tell you now that I sat on the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee during the inquiries into veterans' suicide and veterans' health. I sat on those inquiries with some of your senators, and I have watched them in tears over the years—and you want to rush this through?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If this is so important to you, why is there still no interim commissioner six months later? What sorts of games are you playing with these lives? Do you think we can do this in a month? Nobody in their right mind thinks we can do this in a month. You are being very unfair and very unjust to these veterans, and you know you are. You could be doing this. You and the Prime Minister are sticking your chests out at me because I won't give you what you want, and those veterans are paying the price. How can you do that to them? You know that one month is not going to cut it, unless you've already got this all down on paper. Have you got this down on paper? That is the question. There has been no discussion with anybody who actually cares and is heavily involved in this about who the interim commissioner should be—none at all. Today, quite frankly, you should be ashamed of yourselves. They're going to know what you are up to. One month!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Who is the interim commissioner? Where is this magic man? Is he going to come to the inquiry? If it's so important, why wasn't this commissioner put in six months ago? If you really care about these veterans, why wasn't the commissioner put in six months ago? If you really care about these veterans, where is your response to the Productivity Commission? Where is all that? This is beneath even you. It is absolutely disgusting that you think someone can do this in just over a month. My God! There is no way you can do this in just over a month. You are kidding yourselves. I bet the interim commissioner is a mate. He'll be a mate of yours. If the interim commissioner is a mate of yours and if he doesn't do the right thing, I will be riding him from day one. God help you! These veterans are suiciding, and you're part of it over there. You've been mucking around with their lives for years. You just throw them around as if they can be used and abused like they're regimental numbers, not human beings. It's absolutely shameful of you people. If you actually gave a stuff about these veterans, you would take my amendment and leave this until April. It's your darkest day yet when it comes to these veterans. It's shameful.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do support the government to move the reporting date to 30 November. I have heard from a lot of people who are fed up with inquiries into suicides. A lot of people are calling for a royal commission into it—that is true—but the government have made a commitment to put a commissioner in place. They have given an undertaking that who that commissioner will be will be announced almost immediately. I believe that the commissioner should be given the opportunity to start his work. If we hold this up with another inquiry, that means the interim commissioner cannot do anything and cannot do their job.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">People have had enough with inquiries. I think there have been about 17 or 18 inquiries into this. I understand Jacqui Lambie's passion about this. I understand that she's frustrated at the answers hardly met, but we need to give the commissioner the opportunity to start investigating—and it's not about future deaths; it's about deaths in the past—those over 500 deaths have occurred in our Defence Force, and I fully understand that.</span>

But I think to extend that inquiry out for a year—which was initially until 27 August next year—was not reasonable. Even now, in taking it out to April, I think it needs to be a shorter period of time. As I explained to Jacqui Lambie, we need to get the commissioner working and to start working on this.

                    </a>  I do apologise to Senator Lambie. I am very passionate as well about the suicides that have happened in the Defence Force. Answers need to be had. But, to extend an inquiry out—and it was regarded to the terms of reference to a royal commission—there has to be no undertaking that the government will have a royal commission. What I have suggested to the government and to Senator Lambie is to let the commissioner do his job. He will be independent of the government and will do investigations into previous deaths that have happened. Let him come down with his findings. If that is not the case then the Senate can review that, look at how we will proceed with this and then possibly take it to a royal commission. But to have a commissioner in this position has never happened, and I believe that we need to actually move forward with this.</span>

I will do Senator Lambie the courtesy of doing it again; however, I will point out that that will mean the bill will not be referred to a committee if the noes have this motion. So I'll put the motion again. The question is that the motion moved by Senator Duniam be agreed to.</span>

It is unthinkable that this government would push through this piece of legislation without allowing the Senate to do its job. If they don't allow this bill to go to an inquiry, not only is this an attack on the environment; it is an attack on democracy and an attack on our children's future, because this is about the health and the sustainability of our planet. If the government don't have the common sense to know that our job in this place is to inquire into pieces of legislation, to scrutinise them, to work out what form the legislation and the amendments should take in order to make sure we actually protect the environment, then I don't know what they think they're doing on the front benches. This act and this piece of legislation require a full-blown Senate inquiry. The arrogance of this government to assume that they don't have to worry because they don't want to have to hear about it! It's just absurd. It's arrogant, it's undemocratic, and it is an attack on Australia's environment and our wildlife.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Today's <span style="font-style:italic;">Daily Telegraph</span> tells us that every week 100 older Australians are being raped, assaulted and killed in aged-care facilities. This is appalling, it is distressing and it is shocking, but most of all it is unacceptable. This nation must do better. This minister must do better. The Morrison government must do better, and the Senate should express its view that it must do better by censuring this minister. The country has lost confidence in this minister. He has lost the confidence of the parliament. He has lost the confidence of his colleagues and he should be censured. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a>  We've just gone through a pandemic, and the government has spent—and this is not a criticism—over $200 billion. Yet the government is considering shifting something that works in Adelaide—that is, full-cycle dockings for submarines—over to Western Australia at the cost of $1 billion or more. We know that the South Australian workers there will not leave. ASC have told us that about 10 per cent of their workforce would be prepared to move to WA. We will strip that enterprise of all its corporate knowledge. That will damage national security, because submarine availability will drop. We need to be very sensible about what we do moving forward. This makes no sense. If you've got a billion dollars to spend, spend it on making something new, spend it on improving something; don't spend it on shifting something for political purpose. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a program that has stunk for a very long time. There's a long list of documents that the Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, and his Liberal Party machine have withheld from the parliament, which I have just listed and are listed in our motion. That is why it is so important that they are provided to this chamber and the public. The government have withheld legal advice from Sport Australia, who were perfectly happy to provide responses to these inquiries. It's easy for these things to get lost in all the procedural talk, but the truth is that this matters for everyday people out there in the community. It counts, and it's important for the people who were affected by this particular process. But it's also really important that we get to the bottom of this. If we don't, it could happen again, and we never want to see this sort of thing happen again.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">We put our heart and soul into these applications . We're doing it for nothing. We're going it for the love of the sport and the community that we're involved in. To have it tinkered with in such a disingenuous way is disappointing. Politicians might look at why we distrust them; it's activities like these that foster that distrust. We will obviously keep applying for grants, including local council, state and federal. We'll still put as much effort in, because we still want as good a chance as we can. We just want the same integrity and return that we put in to come back to us.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We can understand the anger and disappointment that people would feel on finding out about these rorts. We've heard from the Gippsland Ranges Roller Derby club, who had the highest assessment score in almost 2,000 evaluations but got nothing out of the funding in this rorted program. We've heard from clubs across the country about the hours they've put in—most of them by volunteers—preparing plans, getting approvals and writing submissions, only to see the funding go to country clubs chosen by the Liberal and National parties as part of what is pork-barrelling.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Liberal Party should come clean with the Australian people about what they've done. They should provide us with these documents: a copy of those talking points ahead of that 28 November 2018 meeting; any records or explanations as to why they didn't minute a meeting where the PM approved an extra $30 million in funding; and a copy of the letter formalising the agreement between the Prime Minister and the minister at the time, Minister McKenzie. They should also provide some basic legal evidence for the minister's legal authority even to have been the decision-maker in this program. It is frankly just astonishing that in all of the evidence here in the chamber and in the committee inquiry, there has not been a single piece of evidence put forward as to the basis on which the minister has the legal authority to be the decision-maker.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This program stinks to high heaven. This is why we have taken the step of moving to suspend standing orders to get this OPD through to get these documents on the table. It's critically important that we get to the bottom of how these rorts happened and make sure they never happen like this again.</span>

We have important business of the nation to transact including, of course, the payment terms legislation put forward by Senator Cash and the very important citizenship cessation legislation, which Labor previously indicated was very important to them by moving a particular motion earlier today. So I assume that Labor will be opposing this suspension motion because, like the government, they would want us to get to the citizenship cessation arrangements as swiftly as possible, because that is a very important reform to protect and support our national security arrangements. I will not waste the Senate's time any further. I urge senators to oppose this suspension and to get on with the business of the day.</span>

It says everything about this government—that program sums it up. It's all about the marketing, the spin, the secrecy, the rorting and the pork-barrelling. That's what went on in this program, and the government should actually learn from its mistakes with this program and release all the information so we know exactly what went on: what the minister's involvement was, what the Prime Minister's involvement was and why $44 million was allocated to targeted and marginal seats after caretaker began. Seemingly, the government don't mind that that's the way they conducted themselves. It's dodgy and it stinks. The information should be provided to the Senate, and that's why we support the suspension and the motion.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Australian Greens Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:54</span>):  Every day we learn more about the scale of the rorting by the Liberal and the National parties, and last night's hearing of the select inquiry into sports rorts revealed so much more. It is absolutely vital that the government comes clean—and that it comes clean quickly—and reveals the extent to which they rorted this grants program basically to turn it into a pre-election slush fund aimed at shoring up votes in targeted and marginal seats.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Last night we learned that, despite all the public spin, the Prime Minister was deeply involved in deciding to rort this whole program to try to buy votes in marginal and targeted seats and, in doing so, overturning the recommendations of Sport Australia and trashing the trust of people and sports clubs across the country who had thought that their grant was being assessed in a fair and objective process where it didn't matter where you lived or who you knew in order to get funded. I want to take you through some of the details of what we learned last night, because they highlight the importance of the documents that we are seeking under this order for the production of documents and why we need to see them absolutely pronto.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We found out that, before Sport Australia had even finished assessing their applications, former Minister McKenzie wrote to the Prime Minister on 17 October 2018 seeking extra funding, and she provided the Prime Minister with a spreadsheet entitled 'Copy of Electorate Divisions of Applications'. What this is is pretty clear just from the title of that document. In other words, 'Here's what you need to know, Prime Minister—which electorates the grants under this community sports infrastructure program are in.' This was before Sport Australia had even finished assessing the applications.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">McKenzie's office was emailing the Prime Minister's office with information about whether they were in targeted or marginal seats in order to ask for extra funding. And then, a few weeks later, in November, McKenzie's office sent two more spreadsheets to the Prime Minister's office prior to a meeting that she had scheduled with the Prime Minister on 20 November. One spreadsheet's got the details of the $30 million program, and the other's got the detail of a $100 million and identifies that there would be 109 more grants—</span>

                    </a>  I am seeking to suspend standing orders so that we can get this OPD voted on today so that the information that was revealed at last night's meeting is there for the public to be able to realise the extent that this government has been rorting the program. Going back to the chronology, which we learned about only last night—this is why it's urgent—the day before the scheduled meeting with the Prime Minister, former Minister McKenzie met with her staff to prepare for that meeting. We found out last night that, as part of that preparation, there was a four-page set of talking points that were prepared for Senator McKenzie which focused on how many extra projects in marginal and targeted electorates would be funded if the program was increased to $100 million. These talking points are one of the documents that we are seeking to have with this OPD.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to see these talking points. We need to have them laid on the table. All of Australia needs to see them, especially the mums and dads who gave their all to putting in applications for the incredibly worthy projects that didn't get funded through this grants program—that missed out because the Minister for Sport and the Prime Minister were colluding on how to rort the program to buy votes. That meeting between Minister McKenzie and the Prime Minister actually didn't end up taking place until 28 November, but then, just days after the meeting, surprise, surprise, the program gets extra funding. Then there was a letter exchanged that specifically referred to an agreement in that meeting. We need to see that letter.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also learned last night that, on 4 March—just two months out from the election—the Prime Minister's office asked McKenzie's office for information about the unfunded projects, including which ones had coalition MPs lobbying for them. The Prime Minister is up to his neck in this, and we need to see this information so that it is absolutely clear to the people of Australia how much it is. The government needs to come clean. The Prime Minister needs to come clean about his role in rorting this grants program, and we need to see all the documentation of how this occurred. This whole affair stinks to high heaven, and the longer there is a delay in sharing this critical information, the longer this stink is going to hang around.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="122087" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McCARTHY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Northern Territory</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:07</span>):  Firstly, I extend respects and greetings from the Labor opposition to the Mirarr Aboriginal people, traditional owners of the township of Jabiru, which is the subject of this bill. I do so as I acknowledge the traditional owners of this country, the Ngunawal and Ngambri people. Labor is happy to support this bill, which has been a long time coming for the Mirarr. The effect of this bill will be to return ownership of Jabiru to the Mirarr people and to allow for a community entity representing the Mirarr to hold a lease over the town.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me remind the Senate that it was a Labor government back in October 2009 which set this course of Mirarr self-determination, with an in-principle agreement for amendments to the land rights act. And it was former Labor leader Bill Shorten who, in January last year, committed a Labor government—which, sadly, didn't eventuate in May last year—to fund $220 million to improve the visitor experience in Kakadu National Park and to support the future development of Jabiru. Undoubtedly, it was knowledge of that commitment that spurred Prime Minister Morrison to commit similar funding for the same purposes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor is glad that a new Mirarr community entity will be holding the head lease over Jabiru township, rather than the Commonwealth's executive director of township leasing, because that reflects the preference of Northern Territory land councils and traditional owners. Gundjeihmi Aboriginal Corporation first presented a plan for Jabiru to become a service and tourism hub for the region in 2001. Even before that, in 2000, an agreement known as the Kakadu charter was signed by Mirarr traditional owner Yvonne Margarula and then president of the Australian Conservation Foundation, Peter Garrett, to mark a path forward for Jabiru from uranium extraction to sustainable tourism and development.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Twenty years on, today begins a new chapter for the Mirarr traditional owners. A Jabiru settlement sets an innovative and practical standard for Aboriginal led regional economic development. The Mirarr and their team at the Gundjeihmi Aboriginal Corporation are to be congratulated on their groundbreaking achievements. This history-making is possible because of the enduring and inspired commitment and hard work of the Mirarr people themselves, especially Mirarr senior traditional owner Yvonne Margarula and her next elder sister, Nida. The Mirarr have been ably served by tenacious and dedicated staff at the Gundjeihmi Aboriginal Corporation, and particularly their long-term expert legal adviser, Susan O'Sullivan, who has worked tirelessly with the Mirarr for almost 20 years and is very much a driving force behind all of this. I'd also like to acknowledge Justin O'Brien, CEO of the Gundjeihmi Aboriginal Corporation. He certainly did not want to be mentioned; Justin, I couldn't help myself, because you certainly deserve to be.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is about a future for Jabiru post-mining and a future that is about local landowners making and realising their own plans. There will soon be a head lease that provides security of tenure for the Mirarr to develop Jabiru. The town of Jabiru was built on Mirarr country in the 1980s, without the consent of the traditional owners, to service the needs of the Ranger Uranium Mine. The town and the mine are surrounded by Kakadu National Park, Aboriginal land which is leased to the Commonwealth's Director of National Parks. The Mirarr never wanted the Ranger mine or the Jabiru township that goes with it. The good news for them is that Ranger Uranium Mine is set to cease operations in January 2021, and the Mirarrs' vision to turn the mining town into a service and tourism hub for the region can be realised.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Mirarr want the parliament to know that Jabiru is open for business. Kakadu is home to spectacular scenery, a pristine environment and immense cultural value, and it should be shared with the world. Traditional owners want Kakadu to be at the top of the list for Australian and international visitors. The impact of COVID has been felt on tourism in the Northern Territory, and that is obviously unavoidable in the current climate. But the Mirarr are ready to rebound, to restore the future of the World Heritage listed environmental and cultural site. This will require infrastructure investment from this federal government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Jabiru falls within the realm of the Northern Land Council, and I'm pleased to record the NLC's support for this bill, under CEO Marion Scrymgour. After the bill was introduced back in May this year, the NLC noted that it would allow for the transition of the township from a mining town to a regional service centre and tourism hub that would drive economic activity throughout the West Arnhem region. For many years, the Mirarr people have been planning and looking forward to the shutdown of Ranger Uranium Mine next year, and they've developed a comprehensive master plan that will transform the Jabiru economy from one that's been focused on mining and ancillary services to one based on the social, cultural and natural resource wealth of the region.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm also pleased to record the observations of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights, which has considered the human rights implications of this bill. The committee has reported that the bill engages various human rights embedded in international covenants: the right to enjoy and benefit from culture, the right to self-determination and the rights of equality and nondiscrimination. The committee has noted:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Land Rights Act, as a whole, promotes the right to enjoy and benefit from culture by recognising the Aboriginal system of land ownership by traditional owners and providing ways for them to own, control and use the resources of their land. … By restoring Aboriginal land to the traditional owners, the Land Rights Act has enabled them to maintain, and in some cases re-establish, their cultural identity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They have withstood immense pressures from political and mining industry influences for so many decades, and their culture has remained strong and vibrant. Now, finally, they have the opportunity to chart their own destiny, to manage their own affairs, and to prosper from their own endeavours. I know that the Mirarr people have been looking forward, with much anticipation, to the passing of this legislation, and we on this side are happy for it to proceed without the need for further scrutiny by a Senate committee.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, I wish the Mirarr people well in their future business. To the Mirarr people: there's so much work ahead of you to realise the full potential that will be delivered by the passage of this bill. I'm sure you will achieve your aspirations for economic development, and I'm sure you will enjoy the goodwill of us all. Yo bauji barra.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="e5z" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SIEWERT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Australian Greens Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:15</span>):  I rise to make a contribution to this debate on the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment (Jabiru) Bill 2020. I would like to start by acknowledging the traditional owners of Jabiru, the Mirarr people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill facilitates the execution of a township lease and the transfer of ownership of Jabiru to the traditional owners, the Mirarr people. It will be a really, really important day when this bill goes through. It makes the township lease consistent with other section 19A township leases by removing the requirement that the term of the township lease of 99 years be allowed for a shorter term of 40 to 99 years. This would allow a lease that aligns with the terms of the Kakadu National Park lease, removing the requirement that the initial grant of the township lease can only be to the Commonwealth. This will enable the lease to be held by either the executive director of township leasing on behalf of the traditional owners or a community entity representing the Mirarr people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens are very supportive of this bill. Importantly, these changes enable the township lease for Jabiru to be held by the traditional owners, which allows the Mirarr people to be decision-makers about their land. The Ranger Uranium Mine was built four decades ago and was imposed on the Mirarr people. The closure of the uranium mine and the expiry of existing leasing arrangements will occur in January next year. The passage of this bill will pave the way for Jabiru to transition from a former mining town to a tourism and services hub led by First Nations peoples. I understand how excited they are about that and what amazing visions the Mirarr people have for this area. The construction and development projects planned for Jabiru will help boost recovery for these towns, particularly post-COVID.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to acknowledge and strongly congratulate the Mirarr people, who have campaigned long and hard to have Jabiru returned to the traditional owners of the land. In 2018, the Mirarr people had their native title rights and interests recognised, after first lodging a native title application 20 years prior. Putting control back into the hands of the traditional owners is an important step towards justice for First Nations peoples. It is an essential step, in fact. This bill marks an important step towards the Mirarr people realising their vision and master plan for tourism and regional services across Kakadu.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The federal government has announced a $216 million investment over 10 years to upgrade the Kakadu National Park and support the transition of the Jabiru town site to a tourism and services hub. The Northern Territory government has also promised $135.5 million to this project. I understand the Gundjeihmi Aboriginal Corporation is very keen for these funds and is raring to start the project to transform Jabiru into their vision. They want to get going sooner rather than later. I hope the government is able to support the Mirarr people as much as possible, and the corporation, to ensure that this happens in a timely manner to facilitate these visions and dreams coming true. This bill is a very important step for the Mirarr people, and we must acknowledge the hard work that they have undertaken to get to this point. We also wish them well and congratulate them and support their strength and determination to see this achieved.</span>

I thank the chamber for the support of this bill. The committee also recommended that a review of the Payment Times Reporting Scheme occur two years after its commencement. I agree with the committee's recommendation. In addition to agreeing to this measure, further government amendments to the bill have been made in response to feedback provided by various parties. The key amendments to the bill include reducing the transition period for the introduction of compliance and enforcement measures from 18 months to 12 months; moving the definition of 'small business' to the bill and inserting a new legislative note to the definition; requiring a payment time report to include additional information on payments made beyond 60 days, including payments made more than 120 days after a small business's invoice is issued; and moving more content requirements of a payment time report from the draft subordinate legislation into the main bill, including details such as the reporting entity's name, ABN and main business activity. Other technical amendments to the bill include ensuring that most reporting entities start their first reporting cycle on the scheme's commencement and requiring businesses to report in a form and manner approved by the Payment Times Reporting Regulator. I therefore commend the amendments to the Senate.</span>

While we believe the fail-safe mechanism is the only feasible way to reduce payment terms, in this parliament we don't object to these stronger terms of reference being imposed on a statutory review. I want to take this opportunity to note that such a review with these terms would help fine-tune the fail-safe mechanism before it is set to begin in our amendment. As such, I would hope Senator Hanson and Senator Roberts will consider voting in favour of the fail-safe mechanism soon. We should pass that amendment this parliament and ensure that technical clarifications can be made to it at a later date to assuage concerns Senator Hanson may have.</span>

Sure, Liberals claim they are, and now Labor say they are the real ones. I've even heard the Greens say they're the best party for small business. You all say it publicly, but when push comes to shove you'd have to agree that the Jacqui Lambie Network is the spiritual home of small business owners and you're all just saying, for the cameras, that you are but you don't really mean it. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm bringing this up because no party claiming to be a party for small business would design a bill like this one. The Liberal Party can't claim to be the party of small business and maintain a straight face. Surely, you'd give it up. The Labor Party says the problem with this bill is that there is not enough to protect small businesses. Hey! At least you're turning up to the party. Welcome to the main game. But you are still moving too slowly. I can tell you that people are getting pretty sick and tired of the major parties talking big and doing nothing about the problems facing small businesses. They’ve had enough of the government talking big and doing nothing about the problems facing Australian small businesses. Once again, the government is asking the Senate to consider 'do nothing' bills that won't help fix the problems that small business owners are actually facing. It's the same thing every time with these guys: more reporting, more reviews, more talk and no action. It is time to wake up. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While we stand up here debating these bills, small business owners are going to the wall because their invoices are not getting paid on time. They can't pay their rents, their suppliers or their workers. They're getting squeezed while big businesses make money off cash that doesn't belong to them. It's not right. Sadly, those small business owners aren't going to see anything change because of this proposal from the government. All they're getting is another marketing exercise—and they're not even good at them. I'm willing to bet my very last dollar that it won't do a damn thing. The only difference this proposal makes is to force big companies to admit that they're refusing to pay their invoices on time. This should have been done years ago.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It will set up a regulator to tell the public and the parliament how many businesses are waiting for more than 30 days to pay their invoices. Whoopee! How about you make them pay it within 30 days? My goodness! I'm sorry, but what a joke! What's the point of more reporting? What's the point of more talk? We already know what the problems are. We already know how big the problem is. The fact that we need to do something now should be bleeding obvious to everyone at this point. Instead of requiring more reporting, we should be forcing those big businesses to cough up what they owe. Stop worrying about your political donations from them. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We should stop letting those wealthy corporations make billions of dollars off the backs of our small businesses and send them down the gurgler, because that's what they're doing. You should stop letting those fat cats have all the power. You should stop standing by while small businesses are being run into the ground by much bigger players. Until we do something, not just about reporting, not just about watching, those small businesses are at the mercy of big businesses, and they will continue to be at the mercy of big businesses who can simply decide to do the wrong thing. And you guys do nothing. There are no penalties. It doesn't make sense that this is the system we are working with. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">No-one else in the country gets to choose to ignore their bills. When I don't pay my electricity bill on time, my energy company doesn't wag their finger at me and give me a little tap on the knuckles, does it? No. They don't just put me on a naughty list that gathers dust and has no impact. They charge me a late fee. They make me pay extra to compensate them for not getting their money on time. They try to teach me a lesson. They try to discipline me. They will send debt collectors if I push them too far, and other businesses can choose not to do business with me if it affects my credit rating. That's the way things are for the rest of us. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Ordinary people have to do the right thing and pay what they owe. Why should big businesses be any different? That's right. I keep forgetting. It's because they are giving their political donations. What do you know! If they don’t pay the money that they owe on time, they should be chased for it. They should be hounded. You should put them in a damn corner and discipline them. They should cop a fine, and a bloody big one at that. Otherwise, you are not using anything as a deterrent, except, 'Oh, hello, you are being naughty.' Jesus! Late payment should hurt them financially, not benefit them. But that's not the situation. The only reason big businesses don't pay on time is because they simply don't want to. They have no incentive to, because you're not making them. They know they can get away with pushing out payment times, because the government isn't going to force them to behave better. What's new? </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And the government knows that you guys over on that side will turn a blind eye, just like you have done for years. This is how it is in this country. This is where we're at. That's why nearly $80 billion gets paid late to small businesses each year. That's why more than a third of small-business invoices are paid after 30 days and why late invoices take an average of 63 days to be paid. Shocking. Some of those fat cats even charge small businesses a fee if they want to get their payment in a reasonable amount of time. Isn't that absolutely bloody disgusting! That's where we're at—because you, Labor, have allowed the government to walk all over you for so long. Where is your spine for small business? Where is it?</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's weak response to this problem doesn't reflect how deep the problem runs. A naughty list is not a punishment for those big businesses, it's the softest rap on the knuckles you can imagine—that's because, as we know, those big companies don't have any shame. They have no shame at all. They don't care about getting a bit of bad press. Why would they? They know that a bad media day will blow over. Today's news is tomorrow's fish and chips, as far as they're concerned. They know the journos will move on. The truth of the matter is that all those big businesses care about is their bottom line, nothing else—not their personnel, not their small businesses or anything else below them. They don't give a stuff. Let's be honest about that. It's in their financial interests to stuff over their suppliers, and they'll do it every single time. They won't think twice about it. And if they get caught they'll stand up, hand on heart, and say: 'Oh, we're truly story.' Jeez, give me a break. They'll go to the government, cap in hand, and they'll beg for forgiveness—which the government will give them because they're its donors. The government will roll over every time like a dog. Because that's how it works. This is how it works these days: you give us cash, and we'll leave you alone. The little guys who are trying to do the right thing will continue to get messed over and ignored. They're fighting a losing battle. I can't believe the National Party is doing it for them—oh, that's right, they get those big donations, too, from the miners and all the rest; whatever suits them. That's fine!</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The little guys need the government to come out swinging and stand up for what it says about helping out small business. That's what businesses want to see. They don't want to see lip service. They actually want to see you doing something. Lip service seems to be the story of your lives these days, you Libs. Honestly, it's all lip service and no action. That could be your new motto: 'The Liberals: lip service, no action'. Small businesses need a minister to back them up, and you're not doing that. There's no way you are. You're a long way from it, because at the moment they're getting squashed under the weight of those wealthy corporations—and you know it, Minister. With everything that's going on this year, many of them won't survive, or they're not surviving now. And you're still not helping them. This government is doing nothing to stop late payments from happening. This proposal does nothing to stop late payments. Frankly, this proposal from the government is completely meaningless. It's just another line—more lip service.</span>

It's about time the government did something about it. It's about time the government grew a spine. Tassie small-business owners need the government to back them up. They need an enforcement bill. They want to hit those big corporations where it hurts most: their bottom line. They want some payback. They want someone to stand beside them and deliver that payback so they can keep their doors open. That's why I want mandatory payment times for big businesses. I'm sick of the fact that we're letting them get away with this stuff.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Originally I wanted to force big businesses to pay up within 21 days or risk a fine. Since I've circulated my amendments, I've had conversations with the crossbench and the ALP, and I want to compromise to get this done. That's why I'll be moving an amendment to the ALP's fail-safe mechanism to make it kick within 18 months rather than three years. I'm giving big businesses a full year and a half—only because I've had to compromise, I can tell you—to get their affairs in order. And you don't think that big businesses, with all that cash, can get their affairs in order in that amount of time? You want to give them three years? I ask, what is wrong with you people? We're in a crisis. Small business can't keep their doors open, and you're not punishing big business for what they're dishing out to small businesses. What is wrong with you people? God, no wonder we're in an economic mess. You'll have more people unemployed—what is wrong with you?</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The only reason they aren't doing it already is because they aren't being forced to. My amendments are an opportunity to make sure that big businesses can't get away walking over little guys any more. I won't stand back and watch this minister kick the can down the road. No-one who cares about small business should be comfortable with that. So to you in the Liberal Party over there, and to you in the Nationals: now is your opportunity to do the right thing by the small-business owners that you supposedly look out for. Support the fail-safe mechanism, and support my amendments that go along with it—because it's about time we forced big business to put their money where their mouth is. And it's the same with you, Minister: it's about time you put it up them. Start helping small business. Quite frankly, I'm calling you out today: it's not good enough for a minister.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:35</span>):  [by video link] I'd like to respond to what Senator Lambie just said. Small businesses have struggled with not getting payments from businesses but in terms of the legislation it has been taken into consideration that mandating a time of 30 days for businesses to pay may be a problem for the farming sector, especially now. The farming sector has contracts with the big end of town—selling their products to Coles or Woolies—and usually they do get paid within seven days, or maybe 14 days or even 21 days. But if we mandate 30 days in the legislation, you will have big business saying, 'Now I don't have to pay you until 30 days time,' and that is going to affect farmers. Different businesses have different ways of paying. The farmers may deal with companies like Elders. Farmers buy their seed, their fertiliser and what they need for farming from them. These businesses give the farmers long contracts, and that allows the farmers to get their crops in before they pay them back. If we mandate a 30-day contract, you are going to force these farmers to try and find the money to pay back these businesses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I agree that the regime does need to be cleaned up, which is why I support the government's bill. You're going to name and shame these big businesses, which has been proven to work overseas, because people look at their payment times. There are heavy fines for businesses that don't report their payment times. That is one way to deal with it. Then it's up to the businesses themselves whether they want to do business with these other companies that are not paying. The extension times of some of these businesses are going out to 90 days or 120-plus days. This is a way of reining in those payment times. My amendment seeks to impose a two-year review period. The performance of these businesses will be reviewed, and if it hasn't worked we could then look at setting a payment time—possibly the 30 days. But we have to take into consideration the farming sector, who have advised my office that they don't want it mandated to a certain period of time. A lot of businesses have different payment times.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is also trying to bring in e-invoicing and encouraging more businesses to use e-invoicing and, hopefully, get their payments done within a five-day period. Proposed subsection (2)(d)(ii) in my amendment basically says that the review will look at imposing a requirement to pay interest on a payment if the reporting entity has failed to pay a small business invoice issued to the entity within the period specified in the terms of the relevant contract. So the intention is that if businesses don't pay within a specified period of time they will be paying interest to the company they owe the money to. But I believe that, under the circumstances, especially the way things are at the moment in terms of COVID-19 and how it has affected businesses, we need to have this period of time to see how this works. My amendment requires that there be a review to see whether or not it has worked and whether or not it has changed the payment times from these big businesses and companies that are actually not paying the smaller contractors. And I do say that it is very good to see that the government have now reduced their payment times and are paying under the 30 days. They've got to set the precedent for the rest of the community, and that's exactly what they have done.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I understand the frustration of Senator Lambie. I get it. We hear it all the time. I personally have been a small-business person most of my life, so I understand where you're coming from. I hear it from tradies, the people who don't get their payments, but if we go in with a sledgehammer we could end up with nothing. You've got to try and find a balance between those people who are getting their early payments and those people who are actually paying over excessive time frames.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I support the bill as amended by my amendments. If it doesn't work, we will have in place a mechanism to rein in businesses, bring in heavy fines and look at mandating payment times then. Let's get feedback from the community to see how businesses feel about it and see whether or not it is working. If it's not working, then we can come in very hard to try and address the imbalances. I believe we should give it a go, and see where we stand in two years time.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Governments must ensure that Australia's counter-terrorism laws remain strong, targeted, and effective. There is no room for complacency in this endeavour. Our national security and counter terrorism laws are under constant review to ensure that Australia's law enforcement and intelligence agencies have the powers they need to prevent terrorist attacks and deal with those individuals who would commit them. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Recently, the Government introduced the <span style="font-style:italic;">Counter-Terrorism (Temporary Exclusion Orders) Act 2019</span>, adding to the suite of measures to manage Australians who present a threat to the community. Today, the Government introduces the Australian Citizenship Amendment (Citizenship Cessation) Bill 2019 to amend the terrorism-related citizenship loss provisions in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian Citizenship Act 2007</span>. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The terrorism-related citizenship cessation provisions were first introduced in 2015 as a response to the threat of foreign terrorist fighters returning to Australia from Syria and Iraq. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Since 2012, around 230 Australians have travelled to Syria or Iraq to fight with or support Islamic State, and around 250 Australian passports have been cancelled or refused in relation to the Syria/Iraq conflict. Around 80 Australian men and women who have fought for, or otherwise supported Islamic extremist groups remain in Syria and Iraq. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The terrorism-related citizenship cessation provisions have been effective since their introduction. They have removed from the Australian community dual citizens who fought in Syria and Iraq and who would have sought to return home with new skills, combat experience, and lethal intent. These provisions have protected the Australia community. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Citizenship Amendment (Citizenship Cessation) Bill 2019 continues the Coalition Government's effort to address the threat of terrorism and deliver on our commitment to keep the Australian community safe. Its central reform provides for Ministerial decision-making with respect to the cessation of Australian citizenship, replacing the current automatic operation of law provisions. Under this model, the Minister for Home Affairs can cease a person's Australian citizenship if satisfied that their conduct demonstrates a repudiation of their allegiance to Australia and that it is not in the public interest for the person to remain an Australian citizen. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The overarching purpose of the Bill remains the same as when the provisions were first introduced in 2015. The Parliament recognised then, as it does now, that Australian citizenship is a common bond, involving reciprocal rights and obligations. Citizens may, through certain conduct incompatible with the shared values of the Australian community, sever that bond and repudiate their allegiance to Australia. A citizen's duty of allegiance to Australia was not created by the Australian Citizenship Act 2007, but it is recognised by it and this Bill reinforces that obligation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The current citizenship loss provisions were recently reviewed by the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor (INSLM), who has made a number of recommendations as to how the provisions can be improved. The Bill presented here today implements the majority of these recommendations. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In his report, the INSLM states: "the notion of allegiance by citizens to Australia is thought by some to be outdated; however, there can be no doubt of its current legal relevance in international law, the law of Australia, and the law of other countries". In recognising the importance of laws to cease a person's citizenship, the INSLM recommends that sections 33AA and 35 be replaced with a Ministerial decision-making model. This is the central amendment incorporated into this Bill. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill retains three mechanisms for an individual to be considered for cessation of citizenship if they repudiate their allegiance to Australia:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">First, a person can cease to be a citizen if they engage in specified terrorist conduct. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Second, a person can cease to be a citizen if they fight for, or are in the service of, a specified terrorist organisation overseas. The Bill retains provisions that a person is not in the service of a declared terrorist organisation if acting unintentionally, under duress, or providing humanitarian assistance. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Third, a person can cease to be a citizen if they have been convicted of a specified terrorism offence by an Australian court.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In accordance with Australia's international law obligations, the Bill retains provisions that no persons will have their citizenship ceased unless the Minister is satisfied they are a citizen or national of another country. As an additional safeguard, the Bill includes a provision whereby if court finds the person was not a national or citizen of another at the time of the determination, their citizenship is taken never to have ceased. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In considering whether to cease a person's citizenship, the Minister must have regard to certain public interest criteria. This, amongst other things, includes the degree of threat the person poses to the Australian community, Australia's international relations, and the person's connection with the other country of citizenship. This enables the Minister to consider a person within their specific context. The inclusion of the public interest criteria aligns with one of the INSLM's recommendations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Once the Minister has decided to cease a person's citizenship, the Minister must inform the person in writing as soon as practicable. However, the Minister retains the right to withhold notice if satisfied that giving notice could prejudice the security, defence or international relations of Australia, or Australian law enforcement operations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Similar to the existing provisions, a decision to withhold notice can remain in place for 5 years. However, the new provisions require the Minister to review this determination every 90 days. Additionally, at the conclusion of the 5 years, the person is provided notice unless the Minister extends the determination once for a year. Withholding notice does not prevent a person from seeking judicial review if they become aware of the cessation of their citizenship through other means. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Once a person is provided notice, the new provisions give them 90 days to apply to the Minister in writing for a revocation of the determination to cease their citizenship. Natural justice is afforded to the person so they can make representations on their case. This provision also aligns with a recommendation made by the INSLM. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In addition to applying to the Minister, the Bill contains several other avenues for a person's citizenship to be reinstated. Firstly, the Minister may reinstate an individual's citizenship if it is in the public interest to do so. Secondly, in certain circumstances, a person's citizenship is taken never to have ceased and it is automatically reinstated. Finally, a person can access judicial review in relation to the Minister's decision to cease their citizenship or reject their application for reinstatement. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill retains existing accountability and transparency measures. The Minister must report to the Parliament and the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security (PJCIS) on the use of the provisions. In upholding transparency, the Bill also amends the Intelligence Services Act 2001 to provide the PJCIS until 30 June 2021 to review the new provisions. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill includes transitional provisions to manage those persons whose citizenship may have ceased under the existing provisions, but whose circumstances are yet to come to the attention of the Minister.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">There are two additional measures that expand the operation of this new model. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Firstly, the Bill amends the conduct provision so that behaviour dating from 29 May 2003 onwards can be taken into consideration when the Minister determines whether to cease a person's citizenship. This enables the Government to take into consideration and address a person's historic conduct that is incompatible with the shared values of the Australian community. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Secondly, the Bill amends the conviction provision to allow the Minister to cease a person's citizenship if they are convicted from 29 May 2003 onwards of certain terrorism offences for a period or periods totalling three years. The current requirement is a sentence of six years for a conviction from 2015 to now, or 10 years from conviction from 2005 to 2015. This amendment reflects the seriousness of a criminal conviction for a terrorism offence. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The date of 29 May 2003 is pertinent, as it is the date on which relevant offences were fully enacted under the <span style="font-style:italic;">Criminal Code Amendment (Terrorism) Act 2003</span>.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">These amendments build on, adapt and modernise the citizenship cessation provisions. They strengthen the operation of the measures in response to the increasingly complex challenges facing the national security, defence and international relations of Australia. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">They further establish citizenship cessation as one of a suite of measures – which includes control orders, prosecution, Temporary Exclusion Orders, the Commonwealth High Risk Terrorist Offenders scheme and de-radicalisation programs – that can be applied appropriately and proportionately on a case-by-case basis. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Australia is a united and cohesive country. It is something we pride ourselves on. In recognising and protecting this unity and cohesion, it is essential that we continue to monitor, update and amend the way in which we deal with those who would threaten it. Behaviour that harms, or seeks to harm, our community – whether that be in Australia or offshore – is in clear opposition to the common bond and shared values that underpin membership the Australian community. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill is designed to protect the integrity of Australian citizenship and to ensure we have the necessary powers to keep Australians safe. It reflects the Government's strong approach to combating terrorism, and protecting the sovereignty and safety of this country and its citizens.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I commend the Bill to the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="LNW" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator KENEALLY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:56</span>):  I rise to speak on the Australian Citizenship Amendment (Citizenship Cessation) Bill 2020. I say from the outset that Labor welcomes this legislation and will be supporting it. This legislation fixes a significant problem in the bills that were passed in 2015 to remove citizenship from those dual citizens who have engaged in terrorist conduct. There was a flaw in that bill passed by the government—a flaw that was pointed out by Labor at the time, a flaw that has been called out by the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor, who said that the mechanism or the provisions in that bill for automatic loss of citizenship by conduct were flawed and should be immediately repealed and revoked.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">ASIO has called for this law to be repealed and for a new model providing for the loss of citizenship for those dual citizens who have engaged in terrorist conduct to be put in place—that is, to move from the automatic loss of citizenship by conduct to a decision-making model whereby the minister makes a clear decision based on evidence provided to him or her that citizenship should be revoked and it is in Australia's national security interest that citizenship be revoked. It's important to understand that ASIO's view is that it is not always in Australia's best interest for citizenship to be revoked from a dual citizen who is engaged in terrorist conduct; it might be in our better interests for that person to retain citizenship either to gather information or to prosecute that person for those serious offences.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, in the short time I have remaining, in anticipation that we may have less opportunity throughout the day to contribute to this debate, I make clear that Labor will be supporting this legislation. We wanted it passed this sitting week, and I look forward to the government facilitating that happening before parliament rises today. This is important national security legislation. I do draw the chamber's attention to the additional comments Labor senators have provided in the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security in relation to the matters which we remain concerned about in this bill—things we would have done differently—but we are not going to let the perfect be the enemy of the good. This is a long-overdue reform. It should have been brought by the government earlier.

As we all know, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a devastating impact on Australia, on Australians and on the global economy, and it has seen Australia fall into recession. But the Morrison government moved decisively, as Minister Ruston articulated, earlier this year to stop the spread of COVID-19, protecting the health of Australians. We also moved decisively to protect the livelihood of Australians through our measures, such as JobKeeper, which is keeping that really important connection between around 3.5 million Australians, as employees, and their employers.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Nearly all Australians have had their lives impacted in some way or another by COVID-19. In particular, it is still having a significant impact on certain sectors of Australia, and in that regard I note what is occurring in Victoria, where so many are still subject to very strict lockdown measures. But as large parts of our economy begin to reopen in the coming months, the government is focused on getting Australians back into work. Our JobMaker plan will return Australians to work and help Australia's economy return to growth. Every minister, every department, led by the Prime Minister from the top—we are working to put job creation front and centre of everything we do. We have a long-term plan for Australians, unlike those opposite. All they have is frivolous comments. Our long-term plan to get Australians back into work will chart the way forward for a new generation of economic success.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We will continue to build on this plan. We'll undertake that important skills reform that I've referred to—the industrial relations reform, removing unnecessary red tape and of course delivering a record infrastructure spend—because, as we all know, when you invest in infrastructure you create jobs. And we are locking in affordable and reliable energy, boosting our manufacturing capability and, as Senator Birmingham well knows, opening new export markets to create even more opportunities and jobs. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

You can only imagine the position that Australians would now be in if those opposite had been able to legislate $387 billion in new taxes. And you know what the irony is? Those opposite stand here and say they are the friends of small and family businesses. The last thing those businesses need is more taxes, which is exactly what those opposite had promised them, and perhaps that's why they didn't vote for them.</span>

A direct correlation with the easing of restrictions is the movement of people back into work. In those two months, we saw the economy create 340,000 jobs.

I will say that is getting close to not being a supplementary question, in my view, dealing as it does with effectively a different portfolio that happens to be the minister's other one. I'm not going to rule it out of order; I'm just going to say I think it comes very close to the line. Senator Colbeck will have an opportunity to respond.</span>

I was not party to the decisions with respect to sport funding made in the previous parliament.

That's what we always do, because we understand that providing tax incentives for Australians to work hard and get ahead helps the economy grow, which creates more opportunity for all Australians to get ahead. We want to create more jobs so that more people can get off welfare and back into work. That's what we want to do. The coronavirus supplement was put in place for a six-month period, at the $550 level. That was always temporary. It was historically unprecedented crisis-level support. It is very important now for Australia to move out of the crisis settings and into the new normal.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We want to ensure that all Australians have the best possible opportunity to get back into work, which is why the policy put forward by Senator Ruston enables those Australians on JobSeeker to earn more before they lose any of that income support. In fact, Senator Ruston has put forward a policy, which is a very good policy, to increase the amount of income they can earn to $300 a fortnight. That's $300 a fortnight that people can earn, instead of $105 a fortnight, before they lose any of their JobSeeker support. We are a government that encourage people to have a go. We are a government that reward people who have a go. And that is how we'll strengthen the economy and help the economy recover after this coronavirus pandemic.</span>

In the lead-up to the last election, the Greens had somehow captured the then leader of the Labor Party into this sort of attack on aspirational Australians, those Australians who have done well. We want all Australians to do well. We want all Australians to have the best possible opportunity to get ahead. We want all Australians to have the best opportunity to get into work, to pursue a career, and to be the best they can be. We are not going to join the Greens in this sneering approach to policy. We are a government that will continue to ensure that the tax policy settings provide an appropriately well-targeted safety net for the vulnerable but also provide the appropriate incentives for people to have a go and do the best they can.</span>

We want those Australians to get off crisis-level income support and back into a job. And do you know what's happening right now? There are lots of jobs out there and businesses can't find anyone to take those jobs on. That is a terrible situation. That is why we need to start making those adjustments. That is why we need to start phasing out the crisis-level support that was provided to jobseekers in the context of the initial six-month period. That is absolutely the right and responsible thing to do, because it will help us strengthen the economy, it will help us create more jobs and it will help us ensure that those Australians who are currently on income support are able to get a job, look after their families and get ahead.</span>

I think the best way to respond to Senator Patrick is, in fact, to refer to some of the singular outcomes of the 2020 AUSMIN meeting held recently in Washington between the US Secretary of State, Mr Pompeo, the US Secretary of Defence, Mr Esper, Minister Reynolds and me, because the Indo-Pacific was the principal topic of our discussion. We reached agreement on a large range of issues. Let me start with the deployment of an affordable, safe and effective COVID-19 vaccine, if one is achieved, and therapeutics to the Indo-Pacific region. That builds on early US support, with Australia and New Zealand, for the distribution of key medical and health supplies to the Pacific at the beginning of the COVID-19 pandemic.</span>

Importantly, to reduce the risk of future pandemics, we agreed to establish a new working group between the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Department of State to monitor disinformation efforts so as to counter state-sponsored and other malicious disinformation and interference.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of supporting the economic recovery in the region, we focused on the development of high-quality infrastructure investments—particularly through the trilateral infrastructure partnership and other mechanisms, including the Papua New Guinea Electrification Partnership and also the proposed undersea cable for Palau—with other partners, including, as I've said, Japan. We're looking at ways to mobilise private sector investment in the Indo-Pacific to deliver high-quality infrastructure and natural resource projects. When you meet Adam Boehler, the head of the DFC, the Development Finance Corporation in the United States, you absolutely know how focused the administration is on those high-quality infrastructure projects in the Pacific and South-East Asia. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Ambassador Sinodinos has been exceptional in his outreach across Washington, and I see that in every interaction and every engagement I have.</span>

Firstly, I think that no matter from whom any exhortation to Australia comes, in terms of defence spending we have a very, very significant reply, and it's called the defence strategic update. Secondly, I would say that the United States' relationship with China, and vice versa, is a matter, of course, for each of those countries, not for Australia. It's a matter for any US administration, no matter who is the elected US administration.</span>

The government is absolutely committed to ensuring that people who live with disability are included in all aspects of community and also to making sure that we provide them with the equal opportunity that they deserve. We recognise that part of that has got to be making sure that we are well-informed about the requirements of people with disability, and that's why research funding is so important in achieving understanding as well as being able to achieve good outcomes. That's why we've recently announced a partnership with the Melbourne Disability Institute at the University of Melbourne, a National Disability Research Partnership. The government is providing 2½ million dollars in seed funding to establish this partnership, which will focus on disability and mainstream services, including such things as health, education, housing and justice. Over the next two years this partnership will prepare and progress a research agenda, a research capability road map, and practical guides for disability-inclusive research into partnerships with the disability community.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We recognise that data and evidence is absolutely essential when it comes to developing good policy and evidence based policy. That's why we've provided a further $15 million to make sure that we can develop a national disability data asset. This asset will help governments across the whole country, as well as policymakers, understand how people with disability are supported through services, through payments and through programs, across the multiple levels of services and service systems that exist within the country at many levels, including state and federal. The sharing of this de-identified data through the data asset will allow governments to better understand the life experiences and outcomes for people with disability. We believe that this is an essential part of developing an inclusive and equal opportunity for all Australians, including those with disability.</span>

That's why we have partnered with the ABC to showcase the incredible work of our up-and-coming content makers who live with disability and to help increase the employment opportunities for those people. The Regional Storyteller Scholarship program is now in its third year and offers $60,000 worth of funding to provide opportunities for regional Australians with disability to undertake a scholarship with the ABC. This scholarship provides opportunities for people to further their career aspirations in content-making, allowing them to showcase their skills and experience through a wide range of avenues that are offered through the ABC. Can I take this opportunity to congratulate this year's scholarship winners, who were announced in June. I'd encourage anybody who wants to be part of it to apply for next year.</span>

We are working with the states and territories on the new strategy. I recently released a position paper, which has kicked off the second stage of the consultations. The position paper outlines the key features that we are proposing to include in the new strategy and is informed by the previous strategy and the successes—and some of the non-successes—of the previous strategy. We are inviting all Australians, whether or not they live with disability or have experienced disability, to have their say on this position paper, because we want to make sure that the next National Disability Strategy is as informed as it possibly can be to make sure it provides the support and the initiatives for people who live with disability and to make sure that our next strategy is the best strategy it can be.</span>

Quite clearly, the decision that was made by this government and announced in the July Economic and Fiscal Update for the extension of a number of measures—whether it be the JobKeeper extension or whether it be the extension of the coronavirus supplement—recognises the fact that we understand that the job market is still very, very shallow.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is not to say that the jobs market has not improved; it continues to improve, with new jobs being created. But I will absolutely agree that the jobs market in Australia remains very shallow. It's particularly evident in a state like Victoria. I have to acknowledge that the Victorian economy and the people of Victoria are going through an extremely difficult time, with the stage 4 lockdowns having a massive impact on their economy and also on the livelihoods and the wellbeing of people who live in Victoria. But, notwithstanding that, Senator McAllister—through you, Mr Chair—the rest of the seven out of the eight states and territories of Australia are starting to see their economies open up as restrictions are lifted, and hopefully we'll see the restrictions lifted even further and we will start seeing the jobs that we want to see return to the economy come back again.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We as a government remain committed to having elevated levels of support for people across the whole of the economy going forward—these announcements have already been made—in recognition of the fact of the circumstances that are before us at the moment. We make no apology for saying to people who find themselves unemployed that we want them to start engaging with the jobs market. We want them to start understanding what opportunities might be out there at the moment. There are areas in our economy where we are seeing significant new jobs being created—and I think Senator Cash pointed out a minute ago the number of jobs that have been created by the recent times—and we will continue to support the Australian people through this pandemic.</span>

The accounts that were presented yesterday reflected the economic conditions that followed the shutdown of the Australian economy in March following the states' and territories' decision to shut down their borders and close down their economies, and yesterday our national accounts reflected that. I don't think there's anybody in this place that would disagree with the fact that the result that we saw yesterday reflected a devastating impact on the Australian economy and the lives and livelihoods of many in it. It has been suggested that opportunities are not starting to open up in our economy, when the jobs figures that were quoted a minute ago by the minister who has responsibility for employment, Senator Cash, say that jobs are coming back into the market. We as a government want people to realise that we are doing everything we can to make sure jobs are created. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

I have not denied that the jobs market is very shallow. I have merely suggested that the people who find themselves unemployed—especially in the states and territories where we are seeing job creation starting to come back online—should be starting to engage with the jobs market to see if there are jobs out there that are available to them. You to continue to perpetuate this myth about us making cuts, but I would reaffirm to you that we have continued the support that we have had in place by extending the coronavirus supplement past the end of September. In fact, I'll acknowledge that even Senator Gallagher said, 'We argued for it to be extended, and it has been extended.' Those opposite obviously acknowledge the fact that we have extended the supplement but are now coming into this place to say otherwise. I'm not quite sure what they actually want.</span>

The first role of this government, and indeed any Australian government, is to keep Australia and Australians safe. That's why this government is investing $270 billion over the next decade into upgrading our defence capabilities, and this includes $55 billion into new land capabilities. This will ensure our land forces have greater lethality, greater range, greater mobility and, most importantly, great survivability for our troops. We must equip our Army to deter potential adversaries in the region and to be able to respond with credible force. That's why this government is investing in strike weapons, watercraft, helicopters, armoured fighting vehicles, logistic capabilities and also emerging robotics and autonomous systems.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our region's challenging environment also demands that our Army can fight across a range of different domains and a range of regions. Thanks to this coalition government, the ADF now has an outstanding amphibious capability centred on our two magnificent Canberra class LHDs. Larger and more capable Army watercraft will support rapid regional deployment of ADF land capabilities, and they will be capable of independent and also task force operations. These investments, and the many more that we've outlined in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Force structure plan</span>, are essential to our nation and essential to Australia maintaining our capability edge.</span>

Today I was pleased to announce that Defence will shortly release a request for tender to Hanwha Defense Australia to build, and also to sustain over the longer term, 30 self-propelled howitzers in Geelong. This is an important next step in progressing the Morrison government's 2019 election commitment to providing this essential capability for Army. This will create up to 350 jobs, and, by reviving this project that Labor so scandalously cancelled, this government is ensuring our Army has the combat power it needs. It is this Morrison government that is ensuring Australian industry involvement in the delivery of this capability over the next decade, and that means jobs for Australians.</span>

There's great passion from Senator Henderson for Bendigo as well. Today I also announced that the ADF's new Australian-designed and Australian-built Hawkei light protected mobility vehicle will enter full-rate production—that is, 50 vehicles per month. Hawkei production, by Thales Australia, will sustain over 200 jobs in Bendigo and an additional 180 nationwide. Most importantly, the Hawkei will again better protect the lives of our Australian soldiers. Hawkei has provided vital business continuity for many small businesses in Victoria, particularly important during this time as Victoria deals with the COVID-19 outbreak. This is yet another wonderful example of Defence and Australian industry managing business practices in a COVID-safe environment so we can continue to deliver Australian ADF capability.</span>

The government isn't and hasn't been ignoring those warnings. In fact, this government has continued to act to reform the aged-care sector, including the calling of the royal commission, which is currently investigating in a forensic manner the aged-care sector. But, while the royal commission is being undertaken, we have continued to act to reform the aged-care sector. Beginning from July last year, we've had the new Aged Care Quality Standards that we've put in place. We've instituted a new charter of rights for residents in residential aged care. We've completed the legislative process to bring together the Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission as one entity, and that entity began its work as a single entity on 1 January this year. So we have continued to act in a reform sense as the royal commission has continued.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In respect of the story in the media this morning, those things are clearly unacceptable—clearly unacceptable. And that's why we've progressed the work on the Serious Incident Response Scheme, and in that Serious Incident Response Scheme we've incorporated some things that didn't exist previously, including resident-on-resident attacks, which a lot of these issues that were reported this morning are. We've included home care in the Serious Incident Response Scheme and we actually brought forward the funding. Instead of waiting until the budget in October of this year, we announced the funding for the progression of the Serious Incident Response Scheme in June this year because we understand it's an important piece of work and we wanted to make sure it was being progressed. So not only do we recognise these issues but we understand that they are not acceptable, and we continue to reform the sector to improve the outcomes for residents in residential aged care and aged care across the sector.</span>

Why do older Australians have to suffer the consequences of a minister who keeps falling short of the mark?</span>

There is a new quality council in place now under a new framework, and it is operating quite differently. So it's all very well for the senator to bring up historical events, but, as I said in my previous answer, we have continued to reform this sector. The Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission, which commenced in its new form on 1 January this year, is operating in a different way. We are providing additional powers, and some of those powers have occurred during the COVID-19 outbreak. And we continue to look to and work with the quality and safety advisory council on what additional powers might be required for the commissioner to utilise.</span>

This investment is in addition to the $216 million already committed to growing tourism in Kakadu National Park and the waiving of park entry fees that our government introduced. The work involved will provide an estimated 1,114 jobs—some 564 during the construction phase and a further 550 indirect jobs in manufacturing, hospitality and transport businesses. </span>

Sadly, many of those businesses, many of those jobs, have been unavoidable victims of shutdowns and restrictions across the country. But their potential recovery is being hampered and impeded by the disproportionate maintenance of blanket border restrictions across the country. Let me acknowledge, though, the wise words of Mr Albanese on this topic. Back at the time of the debate about Virgin Australia, he said that hundreds of thousands employed in the tourism sector depend upon a viable two-airline industry as an essential component of an effective tourism industry in Australia. Well, what else do you need for a viable tourism industry? You need routes that planes can fly on and states that people can travel between. I would now urge Mr Albanese to lend his voice in support. Don't just leave it to Paul Keating to stand up for the tourism industry or open borders— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

In June the minister announced that a serious incident report scheme would be operational in 2021. In fact, today in question time the minister referenced this announcement as an example of his actions. Can the minister confirm that the establishment of this scheme will be four years after it was first recommended in 2017? Can the minister explain to the Senate why he and the Morrison government have taken four years to heed the warnings of the report <span style="font-style:italic;">Elder abuse—a national legal response </span>and establish the scheme?</span>

That's why, when I had the opportunity to ensure that this funding was available—$23 million for the implementation of the Serious Incident Response Scheme—I took that opportunity to ensure that that occurred. As I said in my answer to a previous question today, the incidents that have occurred are not acceptable. That's why we've incorporated into the Serious Incident Response Scheme resident-on-resident assaults, which previously hadn't been part of the program, and that's why we expanded it—</span>

                  </a>  So, my action was to make sure that this funding was available quickly to continue the scheme. It was to ensure that resident-on-resident incidents were included in the scheme and also to ensure that the scheme covered home care, which it didn't previously. I have, all through my time in this portfolio, put this as one of the important things that I wanted to ensure that we achieved. So, I made sure the funding was available and announced in June, rather than waiting until the budget came down in October. And I will continue to pursue this as an important measure for the government and for those who are residing in residential aged care as well as, importantly, those who are receiving home-care services.</span>

This government has continued to progress the interests of residents in aged care across the country. We called the royal commission into residential aged care because we wanted a forensic investigation of the entire residential aged-care sector. We have continued to reform the sector while the royal commission is being conducted, despite the royal commission saying that they didn't want to be investigating a moving target. We have continued the important reforms. Important reforms like the Serious Incident Response Scheme, like the new code of conduct for residential aged-care residents, like the new quality standards for residential aged care across the board and like the creation of the new Aged Care Quality and Safety Commission. I have, and this government has, continued to reform this sector while the royal commission is doing its work. We look forward to its report in February next year.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="I0Q" type="OfficeSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-OfficeSpeech">The PRESIDENT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Time">15:02</span>):  Colleagues, I'd like to make two statements now that question time has concluded. First, touch wood, now that we have successfully delivered our first fortnight of remote participation, I would like to acknowledge the efforts of people across DPS who designed, delivered and supported the system that has enabled this to be a success, building on the work undertaken that has seen more than 100 committee hearings with active video conference facilities since April. This has involved delivering not just the technical aspects but also direct contact with participating senators to ensure they were equipped and prepared ahead of this sitting period and troubleshooting technical issues as they arose. The list of people involved is lengthy, so I will identify just some of the key people, led by DPS branch heads Con Sfyris and Christine White: from ICT James Lawson, Gary Aisbitt, Lyz Lawrence, Michael York, Chris Williams and Tim Ryan; from parliamentary broadcasting Michael Ferguson and Matthew Bourke. On behalf of the Senate, I thank you.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Second, I need to make a statement relating to security management of the building, and it corresponds to a similar statement made by the Speaker at the end of the June sittings. The electronic access control system is currently in the process of being activated on the Senate side of Parliament House. In common terms, this refers to the new swipe cards that replace keys to access your suites. The rollout of this project predates my time as President, as part of the suite of security upgrades undertaken across the building over several years. I have always appreciated, and continue to appreciate, the sensitivity senators have regarding access control and associated data records and management, so I'm making this statement to the Senate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Accordingly, I ensured that extensive consultation has been undertaken prior to activation. The Speaker and I have now formally approved and enacted the Electronic Access Control System Code Of Practice, which governs the management of this system, including its associated data. Prior to my approval of this policy it was considered and approved by the Senate Standing Committee on Appropriations, Staffing and Security. As a condition of that approval, I agreed to make this statement to the Senate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">First, the specific focus of all usage of the EACS and EACS data is for the purposes of security, safety and law enforcement. One of the key purposes of the code of practice is to function as a safeguard for parliamentarians against the possibility that the EAC system or its data may be used in a manner which improperly interferes with the functions and authority of the Senate, or with the free performance by senators of their parliamentary duties. In this regard, the administration of the EACS and the powers given to officers under the code of practice have effect only subject to the powers, privileges and immunities of the houses and their members. These protections are appropriately spelled out in the text of the code.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Second, while changes to the EACS code of practice must be approved by the presiding officers—that is, the Speaker and myself—I will not make any change without consultation with the Senate Standing Committee on Appropriations, Staffing and Security unless required as a matter of urgency, when, in such instance, it will be reported to that committee as soon as possible. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, the code of practice includes a requirement that the code itself and compliance with it be reviewed at least every two years by an independent and suitably qualified person, appointed by the Assistant Secretary, Security Branch, in consultation with the Security Management Board of Parliament House. This process has taken several years. As I said, I inherited it upon taking office in November 2017 and I would like to thank the many senators and officials who have assisted in finalising this code, including former Senator Collins and Senator O'Neill, but particularly to Senator McAllister, who has worked and consulted extensively, reflecting senators' concerns over the last 10 months, a personal thank you as well.</span>

                  <a href="140651" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator O'NEILL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:06</span>):  by leave—I wish to make some brief comments, as the Chair of the Senate Standing Committee of Privileges, which I have agreed with Senator Abetz, the deputy chair of the committee. I note with thanks the President's statement about the electronic access control system today and I applaud his work with senators of the Senate Standing Committee on Procedure to settle this contentious matter. This new technology will necessarily disrupt and displace older ways of ensuring the security and safety of the people who work in this place in service of the Australian people, our practices and the information we hold.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You will no doubt, Mr President, recall the interest of the committee of privileges in the EACS, security systems, practices and new digital modes of working, including their management and oversight. Our particular interest is driven by our determination to ensure parliamentary privilege is protected in ways that adapt to the realities of these digital days. The committee has taken a close and active interest in negotiations to update the memorandum of understanding on the execution of search warrants in the premises of members of parliament, and the associated AFP national guideline for the execution of search warrants where parliamentary privilege might be involved.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the 45th Parliament, the committee considered two matters relating to the disposition of material over which a claim of privilege had been made. In both matters, the material had been seized under search warrants executed by the AFP. The first matter related to the NBN Co papers and the second related to a claim of privilege made by Senator Pratt. In both matters, the committee concluded that the claim of privilege should be upheld, and recommended to the Senate that the seized materials be withheld from the AFP investigation. The Senate adopted those recommendations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the wake of these matters in 2018, the Senate called on the Attorney-General as a matter of urgency to work with the presiding officers to develop a new protocol for the execution of search warrants and the use by executive agencies of other intrusive powers. The Senate noted the new protocol should comply with the principles and address the shortcomings identified in reports tabled in the 45th Parliament by the Senate Standing Committee of Privileges and the House of Representatives Standing Committee of Privileges and Members' Interests.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Compliance with the MOU and the associated AFP national guideline is intended to ensure the exercise of investigative powers does not improperly interfere with the parliament, parliamentary committees or parliamentarians freely performing their functions. However, it is clear from the committee's work over recent years that there is confusion about the scope of parliamentary privilege. In particular, there appears to be limited awareness that the powers to punish contempt may be invoked where the exercise of an investigative power amounts to an improper interference with the functions of the parliament. More practically, the MOU and the guideline focus on the execution of search warrants on physical premises occupied or used by a member of the parliament. Increasingly, the investigative powers of law enforcement officers, which have the potential to intrude on parliamentary privilege, include powers to access telecommunications data and other electronic data relating to parliamentarians or their staff.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In June, the committee agreed to draft guiding principles to facilitate the renegotiation of the MOU and the guideline, and provided these to the President and other senators. The changes proposed by the committee are aimed at updating the MOU and the guidelines so they continue to fulfil their purpose of protecting the ability of the houses and their members and committees to exercise their authority and perform their duties without undue external influence. However, the committee is also conscious that the MOU and the guidelines must recognise the legitimate interests of law enforcement against illegal activity. These protocols must not inadvertently provide a shield to illegal activity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that work is underway. This progress is encouraging, but this is a matter that the Senate first called for action on in 2018. I hoped that the revised protocols, which ensure that the exercise of investigative powers does not improperly interfere with the parliament freely performing its functions, can be quickly concluded. Indeed, I might even put it on my Christmas list, Mr President!</span>

The Australian government is aware of the concerns around the copyright of the Aboriginal flag and would like to see a resolution to this issue in a way that respects the rights of the flag's creator while ensuring the flag continues to be a powerful symbol of unity for Aboriginal people. It is a delicate and sensitive issue, and the government respects the copyright of Mr Thomas and the interests of all parties. We do not want to see the process currently underway jeopardised. It's important to note that the Australian Aboriginal flag can be flown freely, as per the intention of copyright holder Mr Thomas.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, what an extraordinary question time we had today! It seems to be that there's a cancer in this government—that is, they don't want to pay attention to what is happening in the community, there is no accountability, and there certainly is no responsibility. Australia's economic activity fell by seven per cent in the June quarter, making it the first recession in almost three decades. Not only that, but we now in the deepest recession that Australia has experienced since the Great Depression. And yet we have a minister who can't seem to do her maths: there's a reduction to the JobSeeker payment—and a loss of $500—down to $300, and she doesn't see that as a loss. There were a lot of Australians out looking for work before we had this pandemic. And now the economic circumstances are such that one million Australians are out there looking for work. In Australia, the figures are that there's one job for 13 people trying to get a job. In Tasmania, my home state, it's at least 15 people applying for that one job. And the minister says:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">But across much of the economy, we are starting to see the green shoots of our economy opening up. We are starting to see jobs occur.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, I don't know where she's been lately, but I can tell you one thing for sure: in Tasmania, we're looking at losing a lot more jobs. We know, because all the reports are telling us so, that we can expect another 400,000 Australians to have lost their jobs by Christmas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've seen time after time across the last few months small businesses closing their doors but failing to be able to reopen. We have a situation where we have a government that are great at making announcements. They love the photo-op. But they just don't deliver. We've seen that again today, when the minister stood up and tried to tell us: 'It's all okay. It'll be right, mate. It's going to snap back.' The reality is that, in the real world, when you go out and talk to real Australians, people are doing it very, very tough and it's only going to get worse.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was reprimanded today because I held up a blank piece of paper and said: 'Here you are. Here's the government's jobs plan.' There is no plan. Unless we have a plan, unless this government can somehow get the ability to put together a jobs plan, things are going to be very bleak for our economy for some time to come. The leader of the government in this place said today during question time, 'There are a lot of jobs out there.' Please, tell us where all those jobs are so I can tell my fellow Australians who are either unemployed or underemployed. We have in excess of 30,000 Tasmanians who are either unemployed or underemployed now. We've got businesses—restaurants, cafes, hotels, clubs and the list goes on—that are doing it really, really tough. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've got two economies running at the moment in my home state. We've got the businesses that rely on locals to support them. They're saying, 'Everything is going along as well as can be expected.' But they're not putting on as many people as previously. Then we've got the industries around tourism and others that rely on not only national visitors coming to our home state but also international visitors. So when you say that we've got green shoots I'd just like to remind you, Minister, that what's really happening is the vines are withering and dying and, with that, comes lot more disadvantage and social issues that are going to impact on our communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It will be a bleak Christmas for the one million unemployed Australians now, and there will be 400,000 additional people unemployed by then. While the government sing off the hymn sheets that we've seen over the last two weeks that we've been sitting in the Senate, where they've been talking about how good they've been with JobSeeker and JobKeeper, there are many in our communities who have been left behind. The Prime Minister used to say, at the start of this pandemic, that we're all in this together. That didn't last very long, because what he's doing is leaving people behind. He's leaving people behind and it's unacceptable. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:18</span>):  I rise to take note of the minister's answers as well. It's been one thing to see that Australia is entering into its first recession in 29 years—a remarkable event in and of itself. The amount of growth that's happened in the Australian economy, especially over the last seven years, all comes down to coalition governments. We've entered into this recession, a recession that I remind senators is caused entirely by the COVID-19 pandemic, which has shut down economies all around the world. Let me just put on the record how Australia has performed against some of its larger international peers. Australia's GDP has decreased by seven per cent. We acknowledge that. The United States of America's GDP has shrunk by 9.5 per cent. Germany's has shrunk by 10.1 per cent. France's has decreased by 13.8 per cent. The GDP of the whole eurozone has decreased by 12.1 per cent. And the UK's GDP has decreased by 20.4 per cent. So senators can see that, by any measure, the Australian economy has done better than that of many of its peers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said at the beginning, this fall in GDP—this recession—has been caused by COVID-19. Indeed, in some states where there are no lockdowns and no border closures, like the good state of New South Wales, yes, there are green shoots starting to arise because businesses can open. Businesses can see the light of day. They see that they have the ability to trade out of this, unlike those in my home state of Victoria, where there is little or no hope because we're in stage 4 lockdown, and we're going to be locked down for an awfully long time yet. Why are we locked down, I hear you all ask?</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator VAN:</span>
                  </a>  Thank you very much, minister. The reason is that the Andrews state government has failed Victorians miserably. Let me talk about how they have failed. There are a number of ways you can protect a community from a pandemic. One way is to keep it out of the community. That's called quarantine. That was failure No. 1 for Premier Andrews. If you have let it out into the community—and this can happen; as New South Wales has seen, you can have outbreaks—then what do you need to do? You need to contain it. There are two ways to contain a pandemic: testing and contact tracing. New South Wales has provided a gold standard. It provides a lesson to Victoria on how to do contact tracing. Victoria's contact tracing is, on any estimate, at about 30 per cent of New South Wales's contact tracing. By any measure, 30 per cent is a complete and utter failure.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Andrews state government has failed Victorians. The economy is going to be strangled because Victoria is not going to come out of lockdown. The Premier has already stated that he is going to keep us in lockdown for another two weeks longer than the six weeks that were initially planned, so that will be eight weeks of stage 4. Business owners I've spoken to are in desperate straits because, although they got through stage 3, in stage 4, they were just crushed under the weight of not being able to open their doors. If you want jobs, what you have to do is very, very simple: let businesses open their doors. If you want jobs, let people travel to your state to do business, to visit your tourism regions and go to your restaurants. But not in Victoria—they can't lock down the borders because no-one wants to come in in the first place. They have strangled the economy such that it is going to take forever to recover.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that, in coming months and years, those opposite are going to point at the Morrison government and say, 'Look what you've done.' I want to put on record here that I will remind senators opposite at every turn how this happened in Victoria—that it was the Andrews state government that failed Victorians and continues to fail Victorians. He's now even locking them up for a Facebook post. This is absolutely shameful behaviour. I, for one, condemn it.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:23</span>):  We've seen in Senator Van's response the essence of the problem with the coalition's approach, which is that they blame everybody but themselves. The problem that Senator Van points to with lockdowns and border closures around the country is a direct result of failed national leadership. We have a national cabinet that's neither national nor a cabinet: it's just a photo opportunity. A complete vacancy of national leadership from this Prime Minister is a key reason why the Australian economy is in freefall.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There will be more Australians unemployed because this government's JobKeeper and JobSeeker packages were too little, too late and badly designed, and there are now more Australians unemployed in the economy because the economy was in a terrible state in 2019. The growth that Senator Van referred to is imaginary growth. There was no growth. We had wage stagnation, no real wages growth, good jobs disappearing across the economy and productivity falling. The economy was in freefall, and that's one of the reasons it's so hard to deliver growth at the moment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There will be more Australians unemployed—more people will lose their jobs—because this government is cutting the JobSeeker and JobKeeper packages. There are a million Australians unemployed today. That is more people than in our history. Because of your cuts, 400,000 people will lose their jobs between now and Christmas. We heard in the minister's answers that she can't grasp the reality. She was quibbling about whether they were cuts or a continuation of the program. It's pretty simple. Are the JobKeeper amounts going to be bigger or are they going to be smaller? Are they going to be more or are they going to be less? She couldn't grapple with the reality and take responsibility for the impact that the withdrawal, the tapering off, of these particular projects over the course of the rest of the year will have: that more Australians will lose their jobs. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's predicted that 740,000 additional Australians—this is from ANU research—will be plunged into poverty because of the JobKeeper and JobSeeker cuts. What do you think that means for Australian children in those households? What is the impact of poverty on Australian children? There is a complete disregard on that side of the chamber for the real impact of those cuts. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister said yesterday: 'Across much of the economy, we are starting to see green shoots.' Maybe in the garden parties that the minister goes to in Toorak Gardens, Malvern or Gilberton she sees green shoots, but across Australia in the country, in our regions and in the suburbs, this is what we see: we see a million lost jobs. We see no vacancies. We see closed businesses. We see dwindling opportunities and we see cuts to the other opportunities that Australian families look to to lift themselves up: cuts to universities, the TAFE system in ruins and cuts to JobKeeper and JobSeeker. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government is totally out of touch. It has an incapacity to empathise with ordinary Australians, who have got their heads just above water at the moment. They have kept their heads just above water, month after month after month, and now the government is going to cut JobKeeper and cut JobSeeker, and hundreds of thousands of those people will lose those jobs. What do you think that's going to mean for Australian families? This government should be focused on a plan for jobs. It should be focused on using the power of government to lift ordinary Australian families into work, into jobs and into opportunity—and rebuild the economy. Instead, what we are going to see is callous Reaganite Thatcherism driving a very bad agenda for Australians—a weakened government impact. That is why many hundreds of thousands of Australians are going to lose their jobs. </span>

They're not alive and with us, of course, but Senator Ayres is hiding away, terrified that somebody might suggest that—I don't know—the economy might need to have the support of this parliament to grow and become able to get out of this crisis on its own. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's the kind of crazy, blatant double-speak we get from those opposite all the time. I'll give you an example. When those on this side of the chamber extend JobKeeper, providing a gentle transition out of government support for those businesses that are using it, as they emerge bit by bit from this economic shock, they don't acknowledge the fairness in that. They don't acknowledge the extra help that the taxpayer is providing to keep people in jobs. No, no, no. We have to put the most negative spin on it as possible. 'It's a cut,' they say. They cannot resist talking down our economy. But do you know what? </span>

But those on the other side are intent every day that we are here on running down Australians and their good work. We're prepared to fight for you, Australians.

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Leader of the Australian Greens in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:30</span>):  The Australian Greens will be opposing this legislation. The Australian Citizenship Amendment (Citizenship Cessation) Bill 2020 will repeal the self-executing provisions that currently operate to automatically remove a person's citizenship. This would normally be a good thing and something that we would welcome and support. However, the bill also provides an alternative scheme that allows the minister to make determinations to remove a person's citizenship, but—and this is critical—the safeguards in place to ensure that a person is a dual citizen before their citizenship is revoked are weakened by this legislation. The minister already has far too many discretionary powers over people's lives. This is a government and a minister that has attacked and weakened the rule of law in Australia and has undermined the separation of powers in this country, and now the minister wants to be able, with the stroke of a pen, to render people stateless.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill responds to recommendations by the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor that current sections in the Migration Act that provide for an automatic loss of citizenship should be repealed with retrospective effect. However, in doing so, this bill will increase the danger that people will be rendered stateless by weakening safeguards in place to ensure that a person is in fact a dual citizen before his or her citizenship is removed. The potential for this legislation to render a person stateless was raised by several submitters to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security inquiry, including the Castan Centre for Human Rights Law. In its submission, the Castan centre expressed concerns over the so-called safeguards against statelessness, arguing that they:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… do not provide sufficient protection to remedy the risk that a person may be rendered stateless as a result of the operation of the citizenship cessation provisions.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is because, unlike in the existing legislation, a determination may be made by the minister even if the minister is incorrect.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As argued by the Australian Human Rights Commission in their submission to the PJCIS inquiry, proposed sections in this bill that are provided as safeguards in fact change the question of whether a person would be rendered stateless from a question of fact to a question of subjective satisfaction of the minister. The Australian Greens agree with that, and we also agree with the Federation of Ethnic Communities' Councils of Australia who opposed this proposed introduction of subjectivity by arguing:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Moreover, the minister would be able to make these subjective decisions to ruin lives and tear families apart by declaring someone to not have citizenship and render them stateless without any judicial or merits review of his or her decision. I want to talk about the diminished judicial review aspect. The Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills raised concerns regarding the court's ability to judicially review subjective citizenship cessation determinations made by the minister and noted that under this bill:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This, the committee rightfully argued, could 'unduly trespass on a person's rights or liberties'. This includes the potential for this legislation and its removal of judicial oversight of citizenship cessation powers to render a person stateless, which could lead to indefinite detention in an Australian immigration detention facility.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to speak about the lack of merits review. This legislation also denies people subject to a citizenship cessation determination access to a merits review. When this was raised as a concern by the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills, the minister essentially defended this provision by arguing that, as a member of parliament and responsible to parliament, a minister's decision should not be reviewable by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. This lacklustre excuse was rightfully not accepted by the committee. A merits review for decisions by the minister to remove citizenship based on conduct was also recommended by the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor, which argued:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… there should be merits review in the SAD as to whether there could have been or is reasonable satisfaction as to the existence of the requisite conduct for citizenship loss.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These decisions that could have such profoundly devastating effects on people and their families should be subject to judicial and merits reviews that consider facts and not the minister's satisfaction or the reasonableness of his or her decision.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We, along with many other expert stakeholders, also hold significant concerns regarding delegated legislation, sentencing, retrospectivity, procedural fairness and lowered thresholds such as the maximum penalty for terrorism offences that trigger the citizenship cessation provisions being lowered from six years imprisonment to three years imprisonment. Sadly, I won't have enough time in this speech to cover everything that is poor or lacking in this appalling piece of legislation in detail, but I do want to address the constitutionality of this bill and its attack on Australia's doctrine of the separation of powers. The Law Council has yet again—gee, they must be sick and tired of doing this—had to warn this government of the likelihood that one of its bills is unconstitutional. In its submission to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, the Law Council said that it 'remains concerned' that a discretionary decision made by the minister in the absence of a judicial ruling:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… represents executive overreach, and notes that the High Court has held that Chapter III of the Constitution embodies the doctrine of the separation of powers, relevantly meaning that 'the judicial power of the Commonwealth' may only be vested in Chapter III courts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a government that wields its powers of citizenship as a weapon against people whose conduct it doesn't like. This bill gives powers to a minister who has consistently shown that he cannot be trusted to use them responsibly. This is a minister who has no respect for the rule of law and who has at least twice been threatened with contempt of court for refusing a court's direction. This is the minister, Minister Dutton, who was criticised by Federal Court Judge the Hon. Justice Geoffrey Flick for his 'unapologetic reluctance to take personal responsibility for his own noncompliance with the law'. This government might trust Minister Dutton to do the right thing, and the Labor Party clearly trusts Minister Dutton to do the right thing, but I draw their attention to that criticism from Justice Flick and his observation that the current minister, Minister Dutton, has an 'unapologetic reluctance to take personal responsibility for his own noncompliance with the law'. This bill creates dangerous powers in the hands of any minister, but in Minister Dutton's hands they could be disastrous.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Labor Party, in Senator Keneally's contribution, says, 'Shame on the Greens for not supporting this legislation.' She made that comment because, as she observed, ASIO has argued for these provisions. Well, I say: shame on the Labor Party, who, along with the LNP, display a whimpering acceptance of the views of Australia's intelligence and security apparatus. ASIO do not make the law in this country; we make the law in this country. It might be news to Senator Keneally, but you don't have to slavishly accept everything that ASIO say in terms of law reform in this country. It's our job to make the law, not theirs. They're entitled to their opinions as everyone is, and I welcome ASIO's contribution to the debate, but the simple fact is ASIO have their blinkers on. They want increased powers because they want to be able to control the behaviour of more Australians. That is understandable for ASIO, but it's not understandable for senators in this place to slavishly have the same view.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, the LNP-ALP duopoly on national security is undermining the rule of law in Australia and leading us down the dangerous path to a police and surveillance state in this country. We remain the only liberal democracy in the world that does not have a charter of rights or bill of rights. I'm not surprised that the LNP does not support a charter of rights or a bill of rights, but I am surprised and disappointed that the Labor Party did not take a policy to the last election supporting a charter or bill of rights. In fact, in the previous parliament Labor voted against a Greens motion to establish an inquiry into what a charter of rights might look like in this country. We need a charter of rights in Australia. We desperately need to enshrine the rights of our people so that we can start standing up against the dark journey that this country is on: heading down the path to a police and surveillance state.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The absence of a charter of rights, the bipartisanship on national security, the collusion between the ALP and the LNP on every single national security bill that has come before this chamber in my five years in this place and the many other things: the erosions of rights and freedoms and liberties that we are seeing—all those things collectively is how fascism starts. If you don't think fascism can happen in Australia, I simply refer you to human history. We should not ever consider we are immune from the dangers of fascism, and I think it is highly arguable that, in fact, Australia is in early onset fascism as we debate this bill. For that and for many other reasons, we'll be opposing this legislation.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="237920" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator STOKER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:45</span>):  This is a really important bill for Australians in more than one sense. For good, law-abiding Australians, it offers another important tool in the box of the security agencies of this country to help keep out those who hate Australia, who hate Australians and who hate the values of freedom and tolerance that make this country great. But, for those who are dual citizens of Australia and another country and who would seek to do the wrong thing, whether through terrorist acts overseas, fighting with the armies of terrorist militia overseas or treason, sabotage, espionage, foreign interference and offences associated with planning, preparation and carrying out terrorism here in Australia, they will face its brunt. This vital reform will be undertaken through the Australian Citizenship Amendment (Citizenship Cessation) Bill, which the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security considered in tandem with a statutory review of the regime that was previously in place in this place for cancelling the citizenship of dual citizens who engage in these types of acts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill changes the method for achieving that objective. It means that, while we are aiming for the same goal—the cancellation of the Australian citizenship of people who very much object to all that this country stands for—it will now be done by allowing the Minister for Home Affairs to end a person's Australian citizenship if satisfied that their conduct demonstrates, in effect, a repudiation of their allegiance to Australia. The minister would also have to be satisfied it is not in the public interest any more for that person to remain an Australian citizen. The ministerial decision-making model proposed by this bill is an improvement on the current arrangements and, quite importantly given the gravity of these decisions on the citizenship and rights of the individual, an opportunity exists for persons affected by these citizenship cessation provisions to seek judicial review and, in relation to an ASIO qualified security assessment, merits review.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the main complaint made by people who don't like this bill: there will be some people who will say they don't like the idea that the general approach to reviewing decisions of this kind is one of judicial review. I really want to address that and say something about just how much opportunity this bill provides for any problems in the decision-making process to be corrected. The availability of judicial review includes the ability for a person who is subject to citizenship cessation to seek declaratory relief from a court that the conduct that it is said forms the basis of the decision to cease the citizenship was not in fact engaged in. Wow, that's a mouthful! It provides a person with a broad and effective opportunity to have the facts of that issue canvassed before a court and to have a court make a determination in relation to those facts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <span class="HPS-GeneralInterjecting">An honourable senator:</span>  A merits review.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="237920" type="MemberContinuation">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator STOKER:</span>
                    </a>  No, it's not a merits review, but it is a fabulous and effective way of ensuring that we are protecting the rights of the individual. The situation that is most likely to give rise to a need for review is a factual situation where a person has been the subject of a decision to cease their Australian citizenship on the basis of evidence that gives rise to the minister's satisfaction that the person is the holder of a citizenship or nationality of another country, a country other than Australia, but, for argument's sake, let's assume that information has turned out to be, despite the best and honest efforts of the minister, incorrect. It's a very unlikely scenario, but theoretically it's possible because determining if someone is a citizen of another country can be difficult as you're trying to understand the laws of other countries. If that worst-case scenario were to happen, there is substantial protection of the rights of the individual in the following five aspects of the bill. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Firstly, there is the right of merits review for an adverse security assessment if it's a decision that's been made on the basis of one of those, although I freely admit that the power proposed in 36B of this bill can be exercised in the absence of such an adverse security assessment. There will nevertheless have been an assessment, though, in many relevant cases.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second protection is the right of judicial review that exists for the decision under proposed section 36B, particularly noting that this will cover circumstances where a minister made a decision that was affected by bias, where a minister considered irrelevant matters or where a minister failed to take into account matters that were relevant. That's how we sort out decisions that are wrongly made.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The third protection that exists under the bill is the right under proposed section 36H to seek revocation of a citizenship cessation decision after receiving notice that it's taken place. That's a power that must be exercised in the event that an individual who's affected can show that they don't have a non-Australian citizenship or nationality or if they can show that they weren't engaged in the conduct that forms the basis of the decision. It also permits revocation of the decision if it's in the public interest to do so. This is a process of course that needs to be made under this bill according to the rules of natural justice. So, if there was the worst happening and a decision was made in error, there are mechanisms in this bill to set it straight. So all the frothing that we get from Senator McKim and the Greens about the great injustice of this begs the question: whose side are they on here?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The fourth matter of protection that is provided by this bill is in proposed section 36K. It affirms the right—</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberIInterjecting">Senator McKim interjecting</span>—</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator STOKER:</span>
                    </a>  Senator McKim might learn a few things if he could be quiet enough to listen. He could learn that the right of an individual to seek relief—like, for instance, declaratory relief—from the High Court or the Federal Court to remedy a decision made in error by the minister, should one be made, on the question of the citizenship or nationality of a person of a country other than Australia remains. Proposed section 36K also provides for the correction of a decision should there be the disallowance of an instrument by this place where that instrument declares a terrorist organisation to be relevant for the purposes of some of our other security laws. That is important because that consideration can be relevant to determining whether or not the person has done the wrong thing in the first place, but it provides for those sorts of decisions to be corrected should that unlikely circumstance arise.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, if all of those quite substantial measures of protection were to fail—again, I suggest it's pretty unlikely, but let's prepare for the worst while working for the best scenario—the minister has a further power pursuant to proposed section 36J to, of his or her own initiative, revoke a determination if satisfied it's in the public interest. The matters for the minister to take into account in determining what constitutes the public interest are listed in proposed section 36E, and it's quite an extensive list.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, while some in the academic fraternity or in the lawyers lobby—they're always arguing for more work for lawyers in the merits review sphere—might froth at this bill, the fact is it has a lot of protections for the correction of decisions that are made in error and to protect the individual from potential abuses of power. I think that is really important, because it means we're getting the balance right between making sure we have accuracy and fairness in the decision-making and ensuring our agencies and our minister have the tools necessary to keep Australians safe. It gets the balance right.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security made a series of recommendations for this bill, and those recommendations have been incorporated. I must commend the Labor representatives on the PJCIS for their contributions, because this has been difficult to work through, and we have worked together to get it over the line. The recommendations we made for this bill to be improved were to clarify that the proposed section 36B of the bill requires the minister to be reasonably satisfied of the matters listed in proposed section 36B(1) and that the explanatory memorandum of the bill clarifies the nuts and bolts of the things the minister should take into account when considering what amounts to the public interest—for instance, whether or not there are dependants affected by the decision. Finally, we inserted a recommendation for the PJCIS to review the bill three years after assent so that we can continue to improve the way we go about doing this in Australia, just as we endeavour to do in this bill: improve upon the regime for the automatic operation of law cessation of citizenship that was in place before.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These recommendations are the product of the PJCIS's comprehensive analysis of the bill, and they're reflective of the seriousness with which we approach the very important issue of who forms the body of Australia's citizenry. Citizenship cessation is effectively a modern form of exile, and the committee has ensured that any decision to remove a dual national's Australian citizenship is undertaken with care and takes into account all the relevant factors for each individual's case, from their conduct through to their personal circumstances through to the operation of the law of the country of which they hold their other citizenship.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There will be some people who say Australian citizenship is a right that can't be revoked in any circumstance. There are two things you can say about that. First, no person who is solely an Australian citizen can have their citizenship revoked; they're not captured by this bill. It means that no person will be rendered stateless by this bill—and I think that's an important matter to make very clear in light of some of the pretty inflammatory things that have been said by Senator McKim in his contribution. Second, those dual citizens who betray their fellow Australians by engaging in acts of terrorism and similarly heinous conduct reject the responsibilities that are involved in holding Australian citizenship. They repudiate our values and they dishonour the people of this country. Their loyalties don't lie with this great nation, and it is right that that has consequences.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Membership of the Australian community is a very, very special thing. We share it generously with people from all over the world. But if there are people who hate our democracy, people who hate our freedom and our tolerance and hate it so much that they would harm their fellow Australians, well, then this nation is prepared to take away that gift. I commend the bill to the Senate.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:58</span>):  I rise to speak on the Australian Citizenship Amendment (Citizenship Cessation) Bill 2020, which amends the Australian Citizenship Act, and I rise to support the bill. I want to make a few remarks about Labor's general approach to national security in the context of my membership of the PJCIS. I will start by thanking all the members of that committee for the deliberative way they approached this task. I point to that characteristic particularly because I want to talk about the nature of the offer that Labor makes on national security.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We consider that national security is one of the most important tasks that a government must deliver and that a parliament must deliver. What that means, certainly in my own approach to my work on the committee and, I believe, that of my fellow Labor members and senators as well, is that we will never seek to unnecessarily politicise the work that is put before our committee. We think we have a serious obligation to engage with the evidence that is put before us, and that evidence is drawn from our national security agencies and from the many civil society organisations that also engage with and contribute to our committee. To all the people who contributed to the committee's deliberations in this particular case, I thank you.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's support for this bill is not without qualification. Labor members of the PJCIS provided an extensive set of additional comments, which you can read in the report, and I will talk about those a little later in my remarks. Our support for this legislation, at heart, arises because this legislation implements one of the most important recommendations made by the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor and remedies one of the most important and significant flaws in this bill in a way that is not only very important for Australia's national security but also very important for Australia's legal system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to go to the review undertaken by Dr Renwick, who recently completed his term as the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor. I want to place on record again my thanks to Dr Renwick for his service to our country and for his very practical support for the PJCIS during his period in office. Dr Renwick undertook a review of the citizenship cessation provisions, which he completed last year. Consistent with his charter, he assessed whether or not the laws were necessary and proportionate and he found in broad that the laws indeed were. He examined the two means by which a citizen may lose their citizenship and he made two observations. In relation to the provisions that arise from a conviction, the conviction based provisions, he said that this provision passes muster under the INSLM Act and should continue, as it is or will be necessary. But he went on to say, in contrast, that the operation of law provisions do not pass muster under the INSLM Act and they should, with some urgency, be repealed but be simultaneously replaced with a ministerial decision-making model.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At its heart, that's what the legislation before us does, and it's on that basis that Labor provides support, despite some qualifications, because there are things that we would do differently. The INSLM went through and made some very important observations about the consequences of these operation-of-law provisions in making his case for repeal. He made the argument that they operate in an uncontrolled manner, so a person who has committed the most serious of offences and is an undoubted threat to Australia while remaining a citizen is treated the same as one whose behaviour is at the lowest end of the spectrum of criminal behaviour. He pointed out that they operate in an uncertain manner and it will often not be possible for authorities to know when citizenship has ceased. He pointed out that they lack the traditional and desirable accountability which comes with a person, court or tribunal taking responsibility for a decision. He observed that they potentially cause unintended and not easily contained effects on Australia's relations with other countries. And he also observed they cause confusion and potential legal difficulties for ASIS and ASD when those agencies seek to exercise their powers in relation to Australian citizens, because of the uncertainty they create about who is and is not a citizen. It was for all those reasons he recommended a repeal, and that is the proposition before us.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These reservations were echoed by ASIO's evidence to our committee. ASIO gave a balanced indication, indicating that at some times the removal of citizenship is important and at other times it is not the most appropriate tool, and that a judgement must be made on which occasion citizenship should be removed. In their evidence, they said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In some instances, citizenship cessation will curtail the range of threat mitigation capabilities available to Australian authorities. It may also have unintended or unforeseen adverse security outcomes—potentially including reducing one manifestation of the terrorist threat while exacerbating another. There may be occasions where the better security outcome would be that citizenship is retained, despite a person meeting the legislative criteria for citizenship cessation …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's an important qualification and it's an argument for consciously determining whether or not a person loses their citizenship, rather than allowing it to operate automatically, as is presently the case under the Citizenship Act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, we have some recommendations about the way the government has gone about doing this. We've made a series of recommendations in our additional comments that we consider ought to occur. We think that there were a range of helpful suggestions made by the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor about review and the provisions for review. It's disappointing that the government would not engage with those recommendations. We are concerned about statelessness, and we think that there were other ways that the bill might have approached the question of statelessness. We considered that there ought to have been an element of intention when the minister is considering prescribed conduct. These reservations, as I said, are set out in our additional comments. But Labor senators did not conclude that we ought to insist upon these amendments. The core task of the bill, which is to repeal the operation of law provisions, is too urgent to be left any longer. Labor senators, on those grounds, recommend the passage of the legislation.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-Time">):</span>  I rise to speak briefly in this debate on the Australian Citizenship Amendment (Citizenship Cessation) Bill 2020. This is another instalment of counterterrorism legislation, part of a steady drumbeat of national security measures presented to this parliament over the past two decades. Although the bill itself amends the Australian Citizenship Act 2007, it's first and foremost an intelligence and security measure. And it is a measure that involves major questions of principle and process as it amends the terrorism related citizenship cessation provisions that were introduced in 2015 in response to the threat of foreign terrorist fighters returning to Australia from Syria and Iraq.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Depriving a person of citizenship is a very significant measure, not something that is ever to be considered lightly. The Minister for Home Affairs, speaking in the other place, described the current legislation as: 'An effective legal and administrative measure that has removed dual citizens from the Australian community who fought as terrorists and extremists in Syria and Iraq.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill amends the current legislation by establishing a ministerial decision-making regime with respect to the cessation of Australian citizenship, replacing the automatic operation of law provisions. Under this new legislation, the Minister for Home Affairs will be able to terminate a person's Australian citizenship if satisfied that their conduct demonstrates a repudiation of their allegiance to Australia and that it is not in the public interest for the person to remain an Australian citizen.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill does seek to implement a number of recommendations by the Independent National Security Legislation Monitor. The INSLM recommended a ministerial decision-making model, while retraining the three criteria by which a person may be considered to have repudiated their allegiance to Australia. First, a person can cease to be a citizen if they engage in specified terrorist conduct. Second, a person can cease to be a citizen if they fight for or are in the service of a specified terrorist organisation overseas. Finally, a person can cease to be a citizen if they have been convicted of a specified terrorism offence by an Australian court.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill retains provisions that a person is not considered in the service of a declared terrorist organisation if acting unintentionally or under duress or if providing humanitarian assistance. In accordance with Australia's obligation under international law, the bill also provides that no person will have their citizenship terminated unless the minister is satisfied that they are citizens or nationals of another country. In determining whether to cease a person's citizenship, the minister must also have regard to public interest criteria, including the threat a person poses to the Australian community, Australia's international relations and the person's connection with another country or citizenship. There are review mechanisms and a measure of transparency. Senator Stoker talked of those. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister must report to the parliament and the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security on the use of these measures. The bill also amends the Intelligence Services Act to give the PJCIS until 30 June 2021 to review the new provisions. It is here, however, that my main concerns with the legislation arise. I'll just indicate I am supporting the legislation. In deciding whether to deprive a person of Australian citizenship, the Minister for Home Affairs will almost inevitably include reliance on secret information gathered by the Australian intelligence community—the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, the Australian Secret Intelligence Service, the Australian Signals Directorate or the Australian Federal Police. Our intelligence community has grown greatly in size and in its budget. The parliament has repeatedly extended the responsibilities and powers of those agencies. They have a vastly expanded mandate to protect the Australian people and to gather information and make decisions that may profoundly affect individual citizens. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the case of this legislation, the advice of our intelligence agencies may indeed result in a person being deprived of their fundamental rights as a citizen. While many members in parliament are prone to heap praise on our intelligence services—and I too acknowledge their professionalism—they are not infallible. They do make mistakes. The case of Mohamed Haneef is but one case where our intelligence agencies got things horribly wrong. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Intelligence is often opaque and ambiguous. Consequently, I have long been of the view—and I mentioned this in my first speech to the parliament—that the parliament's preparedness to increase the powers and authorities of our intelligence services, and of the ministers who exercise control over these agencies, must be matched with an equal preparedness to improve scrutiny of the intelligence community by the parliament. In this regard, it is a major deficiency, unique to Australia amongst the so-called Five Eyes, that our Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security is explicitly excluded from being able to review the operational activities of our intelligence community. This is a major deficiency in democratic accountability. On several occasions, I've introduced amendments to the Intelligence Services Act to extend the mandate of the PJCIS to cover operational matters. There should be nothing that is controversial about such a measure. The measures I'm proposing are closely modelled on the provisions governing the role of the Canadian parliament's intelligence oversight committee. So far, both the coalition government and the Labor opposition have declined to support these measures. Even though Labor has expressed in-principle support, they just can't bring themselves to vote for it. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The provision in this bill for a one-off PJCIS review of the administration of these new ministerial powers is no substitute for ongoing review of operational matters—the business end of the intelligence community. I know that the minister may rise and suggest to me that this oversight is covered by the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security. I have a letter in my office from the IGIS—who I greatly respect—that demonstrates that her purview is in fact limited. She can't review the directions of cabinet, for example, even though those directions may affect policy, may affect international relations and are typically the sorts of things that parliaments have direct responsibility for. We can't subcontract out our constitutional responsibility of oversight, and that is in fact what we have done. I'm not in any way suggesting that the Hon. Margaret Stone is not competent; she is most competent. But it is the parliament's constitutional responsibility to have oversight of all aspects of government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government may also stand up and say that this is not the time and the place to consider this, but I would say: just when will it be the time and the place? More effective parliamentary oversight can't be put on the backburner. The need grows greater with every new piece of counterterrorism legislation introduced in this parliament. So today I will give both sides—government and opposition—another opportunity to match their support for increased intelligence and security powers with a commitment to democratic scrutiny and accountability.</span>

The bill continues the Morrison government's efforts to address the threat of terrorism and delivers on our commitment to keep the Australian community safe. As we have heard during the debate, the bill's central reform is the replacement of the current 'operation of law' provision for citizenship cessation with a ministerial decision-making arrangement. Importantly, the bill provides that the minister cannot cease a person's citizenship if it would result in the person not being a citizen or a national of any country.</span>

The amendment would have the effect of repealing the limitations on operational oversight of intelligence agencies to the PJCIS. I do advise the chamber that the government, as I think you know, Senator Patrick, will not be supporting the amendment put forward.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reason for that is as follows. Senator Patrick seeks to amend this particular bill to provide the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security with operational oversight of intelligence agencies. Senator Patrick, though, would be aware that the government's longstanding position is that operational oversight of Australia's intelligence, security and law enforcement agencies is appropriately conducted by independent statutory bodies. Again, as Senator Patrick would be aware—and I have listened to Senator Patrick carefully—Commonwealth legislation does provide oversight bodies robust powers to conduct this oversight. In fact, as senators in the chamber would be aware, the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security has the powers of a standing royal commission, and they are very, very serious powers, as you would know, Madam Chair Askew.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security has extensive powers to oversee and inquire into the legality and propriety of national intelligence community operations. In fact, Senator Patrick, when you were commenting on what you thought the government would say in response to your amendment, you acknowledged that the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security regularly appears before the PJCIS—otherwise known as the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security—on non-operational matters and that the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security may also request the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security to brief the committee. So that option is certainly open to the committee should they wish to exercise it. The government's view is that this amendment would duplicate existing oversight provided and that existing arrangements appropriately—</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On behalf of the committee I thank the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity for a comprehensive annual report and acknowledge the significant progress it has made in the last 12 months. The committee commends the commission for the efforts undertaken in the last 12 months to conclude or discontinue older investigations where it was appropriate to do so and to ensure that the focus of its efforts is on matters relating to serious or systemic corruption. This is in accordance with the commission's purpose under the Law Enforcement Integrity Commissioner Act 2006. The committee noted that, of the 116 investigations concluded in 2018-19, 113 were discontinued under section 42 of the Law Enforcement Integrity Commissioner Act. That section provides a power for the commissioner to reconsider how a particular matter should be dealt with. To enhance the transparency of investigations that are discontinued under section 42 of the Law Enforcement Integrity Commissioner Act, the committee recommends that the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity consider how it can collect data on investigations that are discontinued, so that it is able to report at a high level the reasons why investigations are discontinued.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee is satisfied that ACLEI, as it's also known, performed strongly against its five key performance indicators and correlating targets for 2018-19. ACLEI delivered positive investigative and operational results including five prosecutions, all resulting in convictions. The committee particularly congratulates ACLEI on the successful work of the Visa Integrity Taskforce. The taskforce integrated corruption prevention into operational activities that provided timely advice on corruption risk to key stakeholders. It exemplified how working in partnership with other law enforcement and integrity agencies can build capability and capacity to combat corruption-enabled crime. This goes to the very heart of the purpose of the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, I would like to thank all the staff of ACLEI for their great work over the last 12 months. The committee has been most impressed by the contribution made thus far by the new integrity commissioner, Ms Jaala Hinchcliffe, since her appointment in February. The committee notes the speed with which the integrity commissioner has familiarised herself with the key issues and taken steps to continue to improve ACLEI's efficiency and effectiveness.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to thank the committee secretariat for their assistance in preparing this report, in particular Dr Sean Turner and Ms Emmie Shields. Last, but certainly not least, I'd like to thank all committee members for their contributions. In particular, as a new chair I could not hope to have a better deputy than Senator Bilyk, who, in the finest traditions of this place, has been collegiate, helpful and always constructive. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:52</span>):  I had the pleasure of leading the delegation of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity to New Zealand and Vanuatu. The delegation was primarily to support the committee's ongoing inquiry into the integrity of Australia's border arrangements. The committee also used the delegation as an opportunity to understand integrity frameworks more broadly in the two countries, and how individual initiatives or aspects of those frameworks might be relevant for Australia. There are emerging challenges for Australia's anticorruption, law enforcement and border agencies in ensuring our border arrangements are protected from transnational organised crime, changes in information and communications technology that can increase corruption vulnerability, criminal activities which seek to hide within legitimate movements across borders, and the potential for corruption in biosecurity and visa processing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of particular interest to the delegation was looking into anticorruption measures used by border agencies in nearby jurisdictions with which Australia has a close association as partners in addressing transnational crime and corruption. This was of particular importance as the Australian Commission for Law Enforcement Integrity has reported that a number of investigations now involve international operations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The delegation would like to thank the Parliament of Vanuatu as well as many government agencies for their welcome to their beautiful country and their openness to our discussions. We reviewed a number of anticorruption and integrity programs being undertaken in Vanuatu, many of which are directly supported or funded by the Australian government. The delegation was very pleased to see the significantly more sophisticated approach that many Vanuatu agencies are taking towards these measures to improve the integrity of a broad range of law enforcement, parliamentary and civic functions. The government of Vanuatu and its people are to be commended for the great steps being taken to strengthen the functions that underpin their democracy. Australia is honoured to work in partnership with our Pacific neighbours in their endeavours.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On behalf of the delegation, I wish to thank the government of New Zealand—our cousins across the Tasman. We met with a range of law enforcement, anticorruption and integrity-monitoring organisations. The delegation left with a greater understanding of how well Australia and New Zealand work together on these initiatives and how closely tied are our futures.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the important lessons the delegation learned was the need to remain vigilant and clear-eyed about corruption and integrity risks. It's often said the greatest trick the devil pulled was convincing people he didn't exist. The same can be said of corruption. The greatest corruption driver of all is to think that corruption risk doesn't exist. Australian integrity and anticorruption frameworks have been clear-eyed in identifying that risk to Australian borders do not start at borders but can also be driven by weaknesses in regional trading partners. This delegation report outlines the work that some of Australia's trading partners have been doing to minimise those risks with the funding and the support of the Australian government, and we commend these programs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Lastly, I would also like to thank my fellow delegates Mr Conaghan, Mr Laming and Mr Zappia for participating in the delegation. I would also like to thank the committee secretariat for their extensive work in organising the delegation—in particular, Ms Kate Gauthier, who accompanied us as the delegation secretary. Their support, as always, was invaluable.</span>

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Since 2013, the government has reduced the number of people in held detention to 1373 as at 31 March 2020. In doing so, this government has closed 17 detention facilities across Australia, saving taxpayers more than $500 million dollars.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Nonetheless, immigration detention remains a crucial component of maintaining safe communities and strong border control. Non-citizen nationals and unlawful non-citizens who present an unacceptable risk to the Australian community are subject to visa cancellation and are detained while their status is being resolved, or until they are removed from Australia. Those who are refused clearance at the border will also be subject to detention while arrangements for their return are finalised.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This government has strengthened section 501 of the Migration Act to better protect the Australian community from non-citizen nationals who commit serious crimes. These changes have allowed the government to cancel the visas of more than 4,600 individuals who have committed criminal offences. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This action has resulted in a significant increase in the number of detainees with criminal histories in our immigration detention facilities. Today, a large proportion of the detention population are unlawful non-citizens who have criminal histories. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Some of these detainees have a history of child sex offences or violent crimes, including murder and domestic violence. Others have come to immigration detention with significant histories of drug-related offences or proven links to criminal organisations, such as outlaw motorcycle gangs and other organised crime groups. Unfortunately, some of these individuals seek to continue criminal activities and associations while in immigration detention.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">One of the most critical challenges in managing immigration detention is the continuing incursion, distribution and use of illegal drugs and contraband items, and associated criminal activity. Officers of the Australian Border Force (ABF) cannot fully maintain the safety, security and good order of immigration detention facilities, because legislation does not support them to remove illegal or dangerous items from detention facilities. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This government will not tolerate behaviour that is illegal, or behaviour that threatens the stability of immigration detention facilities, placing detainees, ABF officers, service providers and visitors at risk. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Migration Amendment (Prohibiting Items in Immigration Detention Facilities) Bill 2020 seeks to provide the legislative basis to enable ABF officers to effectively combat the incursion, distribution and use of contraband that pose a significant risk to the safety and security of the immigration detention environment. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Mobile phones and internet-capable devices present an unacceptable risk. This has been highlighted by a significant number of incidents involving the misuse of these devices in the last 12 months. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Mobile phones and internet-capable devices have been used to coordinate and facilitate escape efforts. They have been used to facilitate the movement of drugs and other contraband into detention facilities, to access child exploitation material and to organise criminal activity inside and outside immigration detention facilities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">They have also been used by detainees to intimidate and threaten the safety and welfare of staff. Staff have been filmed and photographed by detainees, with this material then transmitted to associates outside of detention facilities via social media. This is causing significant fear and stress for staff and their families.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We are not introducing a blanket ban on mobile phones in detention. We are proposing to allow the Minister to direct officers to seize mobile phones from certain categories of people, while providing officers with the discretion to search and seize for mobile phones in other circumstances. So people who are not using their mobile phone for criminal activities or activities that affect the health, safety and security of staff, detainees and the facility will still be able to retain their mobile phones.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">There is also evidence of illegal substance use and trafficking in immigration detention facilities. This activity is at a degree that presents a serious health and safety risk to detainees, whether or not they are actively involved. This situation is also a safety risk to ABF officers and contracted service provider staff who may encounter unknown toxic substances or detainees affected by potent drugs. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The distribution and use of illegal substances within the immigration detention network includes dangerous substances such as methamphetamine, heroin, cocaine and even fentanyl, a powerful opioid 50 to 100 times more concentrated than morphine. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">There has been a significant increase of prescription medication such as Xanax and Suboxone being found in the possession of detainees who do not hold a prescription for these medications. The misuse of prescription medications presents a serious risk to the health and safety of detainees and these items are also being used as a form of currency, which poses a risk to the order of the facilities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The existing legislative arrangements are inadequate. It is incongruous that an agency mandated to protect Australia's community and borders from the entry of illegal substances, is not sufficiently empowered to prevent the entry of illegal substances into facilities that it operates. Such a position poses a risk to the good order, and the safety and security of facilities under the agency's direct control.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The bill amends the Migration Act to enable the Minister, by disallowable legislative instrument, to determine things to be prohibited things. These things will include illegal things, specifically illegal drugs, and things that might be a risk to the order of immigration detention facilities such as mobile phones, SIM cards, internet-capable devices and medication taken without prescription. Further items can be added to the instrument if they are either illegal or they pose a risk to the safety and security of immigration detention facilities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The bill makes amendments to the search and seizure provisions in the Migration Act, in order to ensure that we are able to effectively deal with such items. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The bill will also give the Minister the power to issue binding written directions to officers that require them to exercise their seizure powers in relation to weapons, escape aids or prohibited things. This will allow the Minister to implement a targeted, intelligence-led, risk-based approach to the mandatory confiscation of prohibited items of concern from detainees considered high risk and pose a threat to the safety and security of detainees. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The previous version of the bill, originally introduced in September 2017, also sought to specify a range of prohibited things via legislative instrument. In response to recommendations made by Parliamentary Committees, government amendments to the bill were introduced in May 2018. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The current version of the bill includes amendments that specifically address feedback from the Committees to ensure the amendments do not trespass on personal rights and liberties of detainees. The proposed amendments are reasonable, necessary, proportionate, operationally achievable and the most effective way to mitigate risk and maintain the safety of all detainees and staff, and the order of facilities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">These amendments include that the legislative instrument will be disallowable; that certain medications and health care supplements will not be prohibited things in certain circumstances; and that detector dogs will be used to search detention facilities operated by or on behalf of the Commonwealth, and not detainees or people entering a detention facility. The bill incorporates all of these amendments. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This bill will ensure the safety of those in immigration detention facilities. It will ensure that ABF officers can carry out their responsibilities properly, minimising risks to the health, safety and security of persons in immigration detention facilities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Ordered that further consideration of the second reading of this bill be adjourned to the first sitting day of the next period of sittings, in accordance with standing order 111.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McKENZIE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Nationals in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:00</span>):  I rise to take note of the report of the Select Committee into Jobs for the Future in Regional Areas. Building strong resilient regional communities is a priority for the National Party in government, so I welcome this report to the Senate. I note recommendation 1.61 calls for a requirement of a proportion of critical mineral ores mined in Australia to be processed and value-added domestically to enable the development of domestic battery manufacturing. I'm very excited about identifying possible and emerging manufacturing sectors but we shouldn't just limit that to one single industry. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Government senators noted that the report does not adequately summarise the importance of the resources industry, including coal, oil and gas. Existing manufacturing must be included—and, again, government senators noted the inadequate recognition of the existing industries that already support our regional economy. The food processing sector has the majority of its employment in rural and regional communities. The Goulburn Valley in my home state of Victoria is a fantastic example of food processing and manufacturing being based close to the source product and providing a swathe of great career options for rural and regional Australia. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have significant opportunities to build our regional manufacturing industry and, in doing so, facilitate a strong, regionally-led recovery from COVID-19. The national COVID task force has identified reinvigorating and bolstering Australia's manufacturing capability as a matter of national interest, placing manufacturing in a prime position to assist our nation's recovery. We must seize the opportunity to rise from the COVID crisis by re-establishing and growing our domestic manufacturing and processing. The time to do that is now. The place to do it is regional Australia. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Currently, regional manufacturing employs more than 274,000 people and makes up over 31 per cent of total manufacturing, compared to 68 per cent in metropolitan areas. Our regions produce more than 60 per cent of our exports and have comparative advantage in manufacturing capabilities through their access to natural resources and the ability to value-add to exports through processing. For regional manufacturing to achieve these advantages, support must be provided through a broad regional development framework that unlocks and maximises regional Australia's economic potential, one that is supported by federal, state and local governments. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, there are challenges to overcome with this. But they are not insurmountable. These challenges include fragmented regional infrastructure constraints, such as freight transport and telecommunications, the need to attract skilled and experienced professionals to regional areas, and a lack of technology. But, as I said before, these challenges can be overcome, and the Nationals have been working tirelessly to do so. Regional Australia is also, in this current environment, comparatively COVID-19 free. This provides a way forward to economic recovery. There are fewer constraints for regional manufacturing. Localising supply chains by bringing regional and rural businesses into the pipeline of manufacturing will create business opportunities, jobs and economic growth and the flow-on benefits won't be restricted to the local area alone. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Investing in value-adding opportunities through the reinvigoration of manufacturing with new technology, new process, and research and development will innovate our manufacturing industry, build their capabilities and create opportunities for development and expansion. We need to make sure that our manufacturers have access to affordable and reliable power. That means a suite of generation opportunities. We need to make sure we are backing those manufacturing industries that have strategic interests for our nation and we need to make sure we can also focus on those where the export opportunities are greatest. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The National Party has always backed agriculture, always backed mining and we've always backed manufacturing. I'm excited about what we'll be able to achieve in regional Australia by working together to build a strong manufacturing base, providing many, many local jobs and ensuring our fabulous product—our primary product out there in the regions—is value-added where it's sourced and exported to the world.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:05</span>):  [by video link] As a servant to the people of Queensland and Australia, I note that the second progress report of the PFAS Subcommittee has arrived 21 months after the first progress report. The first thing I notice is that the name has changed. The title of the first report referred to management of PFAS contamination. The title of the second report refers to remediation of PFAS contamination. I welcome this change of focus. The time has passed for PFAS to be managed. We are not managing these PFAS contamination plumes; the plumes are out of control. After 60 years of PFAS, the number of contaminated sites is now over 900. Plumes at Oakey, Richmond, Williamtown, Katherine and Townsville are spreading across formerly productive farmland. Residents are having their homes destroyed, and poor medical outcomes for long-term residents are a fact we must own up to, yet the government's response has been more spin than substance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The first report's recommendation No. 1 called for the creation of the office of a coordinator-general to control the government's PFAS response. That office was never created and it has now disappeared from the second report. In its place is the PFAS Taskforce, which we are told is leading the government's efforts to coordinate a whole-of-government response to PFAS contamination. Is it really? In a meeting with Environment and Defence, I asked for the minutes of the three most recent meetings of the PFAS Taskforce. I wanted to see what this sincere effort to create a whole-of-government response looked like. I was promised those minutes, yet they never arrived. I did a document discovery, and the minutes never arrived. So let me repeat my request: where are the minutes?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The first report's second recommendation was that the government should continue to upscale its investment on the containment of PFAS plumes leaving defence bases. That was perfectly clear. Has that been done? No. Defence had four mini remediation plants before the first report came out. It still has four. All of those are on defence land. There has been no active remediation in the red zones around defence bases. As a result, these plumes are spreading and drawing more and more everyday Australians into this PFAS nightmare.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The first report's third recommendation called on the government to 'review its existing advice in relation to the human health effects of PFAS exposure, including to acknowledge the potential links to certain medical conditions'. In one of my meetings with Defence on PFAS, I asked for the medical science they were relying on for their stated position that residents in red zones were not risking medical conditions provided they did not drink bore water. The studies I received were small-scale studies, frequently offered by DuPont as proof that PFAS is harmless. Scientific integrity is essential to good governance. PFAS compensation and remediation will cost billions and become a major exercise. The decision as to who we should compensate and relocate must be based on good, robust science—not cover-up studies, funded by DuPont, of five cows.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is for good reason that the new report's recommendation No. 5 calls on the government to use information on PFAS related matters that is factual and cites trusted sources. I wholeheartedly agree.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The first report's fifth recommendation called on the Australian government to assist property owners and businesses in affected areas with compensation, including the possibility of buybacks. Shortly after that report was released, the government chair of the PFAS Subcommittee, Andrew Laming MP, was dumped as chairman. There will be no talk of compensation and buybacks in this government. So imagine my surprise when the second progress report arrived on Tuesday and says the same thing:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Committee recommends that the Government prioritise assisting property owners and businesses … through compensation for financial losses … including the possibility of buy-backs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Has this been progressed? No. The government is fighting compensation through the courts. This makes no sense. The government knows it is going to have to pay this money eventually. Why pay it to lawyers instead of affected residents? When all the new science on PFAS is considered, when the litany of medical conditions suffered by residents in the red zones is considered, and when the financial losses stemming from not being able to use their properties are considered, the only fair and decent thing to do is compensation and like-for-like relocation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I applaud the committee for having the courage to say what must be said. It's time to make this right.</span>
                </p>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Nationals in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:10</span>):  Our country's million-strong law-abiding firearm owners know all too well the impact felt as a result of unwarranted actions from law enforcement. So I welcome the parliamentary joint committee's report<span style="font-style:italic;"> Inquiry into the impact of the exercise of law enforcement and intelligence powers on the freedom of the press</span>. I note that section 2.4 details the background and events leading up to the inquiry. The principles of Australian democracy were considered as being at the very heart of their inquiry. These democratic principles of limited government, the rule of law and the idea of a democratic social contract are fundamental to our society, yet time and again they have failed for our law-abiding firearm owners in Victoria.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Victorian state Labor government is determined that Victorians who have diligently earned and maintained a firearms licence are to be subject to punishment for breaches of COVID-19 regulations far beyond those of the general public in Victoria. The Victorian police have threatened to 'reprimand, suspend or cancel' licences of registered firearm owners who 'blatantly and deliberately breach' the current directives of the Victorian Chief Health Officer. That a direct quote there from VicPol. This threat from law enforcement could not be further from those principles of Australian democracy, and it is the antithesis of what determines a democratic social contract. No other comparable sections of society face such obviously discriminatory supplementary punishments for COVID-19 breaches. There are no reprimands for fishing licences. There's no cancelling of your drivers licence. Only law-abiding, licensed firearm owners are the subject of this politically motivated presumption of guilt in my home state of Victoria.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What is so concerning is that it is not an isolated act. It is yet another example of law-abiding firearm owners being singled out for unfair and discriminatory action. Licenced firearm traders have had to face unlawful discrimination from our banking system, having been subject to a number of discriminatory lending practices. APRA confirmed that the banks had no lawful grounds to discriminate, but in many cases the damage had already been done, both financially and to the reputation of hardworking Australians. Many of those affected were small-business owners, of which there are an estimated 400 in the industry, translating into over 19,000 local jobs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The state Labor government in Victoria continues to use COVID-19 as justification to enact their discriminatory agenda against lawful firearm owners. In March, Premier Daniel Andrews and the Victorian Labor government took advantage of the pandemic to unlawfully, again, suspend the sale of guns and ammunition in Victoria. This was followed by Victorian police minister Lisa Neville insinuating that firearm owners had exacerbated the threat of domestic violence, despite there being absolutely no data to support Minister Neville's claims. Our community deserves better. No other industry has been subject to such a blatant, opportunistic attempt at financial sabotage. This is not a fair democratic social contract.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The hunting, sporting and shooting industry contributed over $2.4 billion to our economy in 2018 and, as I said, generates over19,000 jobs. Law-abiding firearm owners are proactive in their community: celebrating a cultural practice, participating in sport, winning gold medals for our country and ridding our environment of feral animals and pests that do so much damage. Rather than discriminate against them, we should be thanking them, and we should be treating them like every single other citizen. It's absolutely appalling that the state Labor government in my home state has chosen to use the COVID-19 pandemic as an opportunity to continue to threaten and discriminate against law-abiding firearm owners in Victoria.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:15</span>):  I'd like to very briefly take note of the report of the Select Committee into Jobs for the Future in Regional Areas. That was not a committee I was a member of, but I did follow that inquiry quite closely given my interest in the subject matter of jobs in regional Australia, particularly in my state of Queensland. I think that this is a particularly important topic at the moment as we all seek to deal with the effects of COVID-19. The reason I wanted to say something today is that we all know that tomorrow there's going to be another meeting of the national cabinet, and one of the reasons we know that meeting is on tomorrow is that we've seen sustained attacks day after day by the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and various LNP members from Queensland on the Queensland premier, Annastacia Palaszczuk, and her government.</span>

Well, weren't they proven wrong!

                    </a>  You're right, Senator Bilyk: they haven't had the same passion about opening the borders in Tasmania. I wonder if that could be about it being a Liberal premier down there and a Liberal government. I wonder if that's why they haven't had a lot to say about the South Australian borders opening as well—something about it being a Liberal government versus a Labor government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some important statistics came out yesterday, and they are important in terms of jobs in regional Queensland. If the Prime Minister, the Treasurer and his LNP colleagues were right in saying that Queensland's closed borders are destroying our local economy, you would have thought that would've been backed up in yesterday's national accounts figures. We saw in yesterday's national accounts figures that we are now in the worst recession that this country has seen in 100 years. That will always be the record of Scott Morrison as Prime Minister, Josh Frydenberg as Treasurer and all of the LNP team behind them. They have delivered the worst recession in Australia in 100 years. But it's very interesting to have a look at how different states have coped with this in an economic sense, and it's very interesting when you look at the map of Australia that's included in those national accounts to see how each different state has performed. Funnily enough, despite the attacks of the Prime Minister and the Treasurer and their LNP team on Premier Palaszczuk and the state Labor government, it turns out that those Labor states with hard borders, such as Queensland and Western Australia, have performed better economically than open-border states like New South Wales. If tough borders like what Queensland has were killing the Queensland economy in the way the Prime Minister says, you'd think that would be reflected in the figures. Instead, while Queensland's economy has contracted, as has every other state economy around the country, it has contracted by 5.9 per cent, as opposed to New South Wales, the worst performing state, which has had its state economy contract by 8.6 per cent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On one hand, we have Queensland: tough borders, kept infection rates low, economy contracting by only 5.9 per cent—still more than we'd like to see but a lot lower than other states. On the other hand, we have New South Wales: open borders, higher infection rates, a worse economic collapse. If that doesn't tell the story, I don't know what does.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So can I suggest to the Prime Minister and all his LNP colleagues that maybe they could spend a bit more time focusing on what's going wrong in New South Wales. Of every state, that's the state whose economy has collapsed the most, with its open borders. And it's states like Queensland and WA, which have had closed borders—opposed by the Prime Minister, opposed by the Treasurer, opposed by the LNP—that have shielded their local economies and local jobs more than other states. The proof is in the pudding. Queensland taking strong action on borders has kept us safe from COVID, has kept our infection rates relatively low compared with other states and has shielded our economy from the worst of the economic fallout from this recession delivered by the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister should stop his bullyboy antics. He should stop picking on Premier Palaszczuk and stop briefing against her in the media. He should get his own act together. He should be a leader. He should actually get the national cabinet working and make sure the entire Australian economy is being shielded, not just the Queensland economy, which is being shielded by Premier Palaszczuk. I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This motion deals with an issue that is at the very centre of Australian government. In Sydney on 13 March 2020 the Council of Australian Governments held its 48th meeting, which had been convened to deal with the rapidly escalating COVID-19 crisis. At that meeting the Prime Minister and the premiers and chief ministers endorsed measures that had been taken in response to the pandemic and agreed to commission protocols underpinned by advice from the Australian Health Protection Principal Committee, the AHPPC, relating to the management of mass gatherings, school closures, the health needs of more-remote communities, and public transport. COAG further agreed that the AHPPC advice will have the status of COAG advice and to implement and follow the advice as necessary. The COAG communique did not include any references to changes in intergovernmental consultation and decision-making.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But at the following press conference the Prime Minister announced that it had been resolved to form what is called a national cabinet, comprising himself and the premiers and chief ministers, that would meet on a weekly basis to ensure a coordinated response across the country to COVID-19. The first national cabinet meeting took place on 15 March 2020 and met frequently thereafter.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 29 May, the Prime Minister announced the abolition of COAG and its replacement with the national cabinet as the apex of a new National Federation Reform Council. The Council on Federal Financial Relations, consisting of the federal, state and territory treasurers, will report to national cabinet. Various intergovernmental councils and task forces will also be subordinate to the national council, as will the AHPPC.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This motion goes not to the performance of the national cabinet but to the nature of its radical change in practices. I might point out that—again, consistent with what I was saying, that I'm not critical of the work of the national cabinet—in World War II we had a national council. It's not a new idea to bring premiers, the Prime Minister and territory leaders together. What's new with this particular arrangement is that the Prime Minister has sought to veil all activities under the national cabinet under cabinet-in-confidence. That goes against all principles of democratic and responsible government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Cabinet has been around for a long time. It's not a creature of statute; it's a creature of convention. Ever since Federation, we've had a cabinet. It was not necessarily well organised in the first 20 or so years. In 1926, we had our first cabinet handbook. That was secret. In the 1980s it was published, setting out rules around the convention that gave some consistency and integrity to the cabinet body and to the officials that worked around it but also gave some flexibility to the Prime Minister as well. Except what's happening now is the Prime Minister has abandoned what most people would consider to be a cabinet, and that is a cabinet of ministers—and that means people appointed in parliament—and has extended it to other categories, such as the AHPPC. Suddenly now a cabinet is not a cabinet of ministers; it's a cabinet of doctors. Also, there's the NCCC. That's a cabinet of entrepreneurs and executives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The difficulty here is the government is challenging any requests for information on anything that these bodies do either from the COVID committee, which has had great difficulty getting access to information, or indeed, from people who simply want to participate in democracy using FOI. What's happening is that the national cabinet and its secrecy provisions are being expanded to the point where they intrude upon statute rights. This parliament has granted rights to Australian citizens to have access to information. Of course, cabinet-in-confidence information is an exemption under FOI. But, by purporting to lawfully expand the national cabinet to cover all manner of things, it intrudes upon the rights that were set up when that bill was first introduced in 1982, and that is not acceptable. And it is now subject to challenge.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I do have an Information Commissioner challenge. I can inform the chamber that the Information Commissioner is now considering elevating that to the AAT, recognising the complexity and importance of the question that is being put to them, and that is: is the national cabinet a cabinet for the purposes of the FOI Act? Can a cabinet be, as the national cabinet is, one Prime Minister and no other permanent members? When the Prime Minister has a meeting with his COMCAR driver or his gardener, could that be cabinet-in-confidence? So we have to look at how we deal with that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm also challenging the fact that the national cabinet is not a cabinet of government that reports to one parliament. So we will have to see how that plays out. But I suggest that what this parliament now needs to consider, in order to make sure that we don't have this sort of abuse moving forward, is perhaps wrapping some statute around cabinet itself. I support the idea of cabinet, but when it starts to intrude on responsible government it has to be challenged.</span>

The Victorian numberplate, I think, was 'Victoria - Garden State'. I think now it is 'Victoria - The Education State'. But looking at recent events you'd think that Victoria probably needs to change their numberplates to 'Victoria - Where Freedom Goes to Die', or, 'Victoria - The Police State', or, 'Victoria: All Praise Chairman Dan'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm a big supporter of the police in Queensland. I'm a big supporter of what our police officers and their families do to protect us. But you sort of have to ask yourself: what is going on in Victoria when a pregnant mother—someone who is pregnant!—is handcuffed by the police, not because she has committed a crime—she wasn't a bank robber or a hooligan—but because she did a Facebook post? This is the Australia we live in, where there are Labor premiers. In Victoria, this person—and I don't know this lady from Eve—can be arrested in her own home and put in handcuffs, for a Facebook post. Seriously? Is this what society is coming to—where the police are barging into people's homes and enforcing a code and then arresting people?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is Victoria where, mere weeks ago, tens of thousands of people protested in the streets for Black Lives Matter. Now I'm someone who fundamentally and strongly believes in the power and the right and the might of freedom of speech, but I do know that through this current crisis we've had to give up some of our freedoms. But what seems to have happened in Victoria is that there are certain types of 'approved' freedoms. Yes, you're allowed to go and protest for Black Lives Matter, but if you want to have a different protest—for something the police and the Labor government don't approve of—well: 'No, no, no. Madam, come over here, please. We'll pop the handcuffs on you and throw you in the paddy wagon and pop you off to jail.' What is society coming to when that is what the police are doing in Victoria? Are we serious about this?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And then we go to Queensland, my home state, where the Labor government is using coronavirus as an alibi to cover up their poor economic record. Senator Murray Watt is very proud of the economic record in Queensland. He said, 'The proof is in the pudding'. Well, it's a pretty rotten pudding when you look at Queensland's economic record. We have the highest bankruptcies in Australia, the highest unemployment in Australia and the lowest level of business confidence. I would invite those Labor senators to go around regional Queensland and see the impacts of what Labor has been doing to the financial and economic system in Queensland. And shame on the Labor Party for that, because they're using coronavirus to cover up their dodgy financial and economic malpractice. But, even more shamefully, they're using border wars as a political issue. And people justify it. They say: 'Oh, it's very popular.' Well, just because something is popular doesn't mean it is right or good for you. It's like double-deep-fried chips with extra salt—you know, I love them. They're very popular, but not necessarily good for me. We need to make sure that, when it comes to these border wars, there is compassion and common sense.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I encourage people to watch the mayor of Moree in her interview on <span style="font-style:italic;">Sunrise</span> this morning, where she took the lash to Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk about the politics of the border wars. We need to make sure we stand up for all Australians and those who need help. Hospitals are for Australians; they're not for someone because they live on one side of the border and not the other. How dare we tell a pregnant mother, 'You cannot come to a Queensland hospital'! How dare we tell that mother, 'You have to wait for 16 hours and then you can go to Sydney and you will lose your child'! How dare we! Is that what our society has come to, that we use party politics and we lose lives over it? How dare you, Premier! Shame on you!</span>

                  <a href="LNW" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator KENEALLY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:35</span>):  I want to bring to the Morrison government's attention what's in the front of Australian passports. It reads: 'The Australian government provides assistance to Australians in difficulty overseas.' An Australian passport is a powerful tool—well, it used to be until the Morrison government came along. As of this week there are 23,000 stranded Aussies overseas, 23,000 Australians trying to get home in the middle of a global pandemic. In fact, 23,000 people is basically the capacity of 'Shark Park', the home of Prime Minister Scott Morrison's beloved—and adopted—Rugby League team. That's how many Australians are stranded overseas. We learned this week from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade that that number has jumped by more than 20 per cent in the last fortnight. Of these stranded Aussies, 3,450 are considered to be medically or financially vulnerable. What has the Morrison government done for these stranded Aussies? Nothing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are Australian citizens. These are people who have the right to come back to their country because they are Australians. Tomorrow it will be eight weeks since Scott Morrison rushed to make an announcement on caps for incoming international passengers. In fact, the day he announced the caps, the Prime Minister was asked about Aussies getting home and he said, 'It will be more difficult because there will be a reduction in the available capacity for people coming back to Australia.' The Morrison government knew they were going to be stranding Australians, including Australian families, overseas, so what did they do? Nothing. Did they come up with a plan? No. Did they communicate effectively with Australians overseas? No. Did they provide assurances to friends and families in Australia? No. Two weeks ago the Prime Minister announced in the media that he had asked his senior ministers to come up with ideas to support those Australians stranded overseas as a result of this cap. And what have the senior ministers of the Morrison government done? Nothing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Morrison is more interested in getting a headline than in developing a plan. It's not as if these 23,000 Australians haven't been trying to get home—they have. It's easy for members of the government to say, 'They should have come home already,' but this government is leaving these Australians behind. International borders have been closed, planes have been grounded, flights have been cancelled. Mr Scott Morrison imposed a cap on arrivals, and now Australians are being price gouged by airlines. Eight weeks after the cap was announced there's been no plan from this government to do its most basic function: look after Australians who are stranded overseas and enable them to come home in the middle of a deadly global pandemic.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of my Western Australian colleagues pointed out to me that in March this government announced an international freight assistance mechanism. It's great that we're able to support trade, but let's understand what this freight assistance mechanism does: it flies lobsters, prawns and abalone from Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane and Perth to China, Japan, Hong Kong, Singapore and the United Arab Emirates. It's great to support trade. How much has the Morrison government spent on this? Three hundred and fifty million dollars. How many chartered flights has the Morrison government sent out for seafood? One thousand, eight hundred flights. That's fantastic if you're into trading seafood, but under the Morrison government nothing's been done for stranded Australians. If you're a lobster you get a ticket on a charter flight, but if you're an Aussie overseas you get stranded, left behind by this Morrison government. They've been left stranded in the UK, in Singapore, in the Philippines, in India and in Lebanon—in Lebanon after a humanitarian disaster, one this government has already acknowledged.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians are being told by this government to raid their superannuation or start online fundraisers to get home. Sydney mum Melissa Inkster arrived home this week after being stranded in the Democratic Republic of Congo since March. She ended up having to fundraise $15,000 to get home. My colleagues and I have been flooded with stories of stranded Aussies trying to get help. If you go to removethecap.com, you'll be able to read stories of Australians stranded overseas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison government can allow the number of arrivals under international flight caps to go up and stop the price gouging. They can charter flights with Virgin or Qantas planes that are currently sitting in storage or put in place federal quarantine arrangements like they did when they brought people home from Wuhan. It can be done. This is a heartfelt demand for the 23,000 Australians who are separated from their loved ones right now. The Morrison government need to bring these stranded Aussies home. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator PATRICK</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:40</span>):  Australia's space activity could be best described as having been disorganised and haphazard, hence the title of the Senate committee report back in 2008, <span style="font-style:italic;">Lost in s</span><span style="font-style:italic;">pace? setting a new direction for Australia's space science and industry sector</span>. An announcement to set up a space program in September 2017 by the government was well received. True to its word, in July 2018, the Australian Space Agency was formally stood up, with $26 million in seed funding allocated in the budget. Australia was committing. Enthusiasm was high. The Space Agency issued their strategy in April 2019, with fantastic targets—$12 billion per annum in activity and an additional 20,000 jobs by 2030. Who could be shy in their enthusiasm on that?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm very keen for Australia to enter the space domain. We have the land, location, people and the smarts to do this, and South Australia will play a pretty key role in all of this. I've been watching. From media releases to announcements, I see the grants flowing and international and domestic agreements being signed. I see that Australian companies have been winning commercial contracts with domestic and foreign customers. One media releases says the Space Agency is an agency:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… focusing on market gaps, emerging areas and areas of competitive advantage. Collaboration between government, our R&amp;D sector and industry is growing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It looks like all systems are go. However, now the reality is setting in and the view is less favourable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">An article in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span> on 1 September sets the scene with the headline 'Countdown on but space industry dragged back to Earth by bureaucratic delays'. I wasn't surprised when I read this. In fact, this was one of my concerns as we entered into this new foray. So I started making my own inquiries. What did I discover? I found an industry highly enthusiastic on the topic of what they do. But no-one wanted to talk to me about the issues they're facing. They're concerned about the situation which is threatening their survivability, but they're not willing to talk about it. I see this in the Australian defence industry as well. They fear speaking out because of the result and persecution from the all-powerful Department of Defence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's clear a major issue is the inability of Australian companies to get permits from the Space Agency to launch rockets. One company applied in September last year. It turned out they needed a permit from the Civil Aviation Safety Authority, which took a couple months, and one from the Space Agency, which they don't have yet, and they have no idea when they'll get it. The launch is supposed to be next month. I think the only way the company may get into space is by simply stacking up all the paperwork they've had to fill in and climb up—then they might actually get there! Again, no-one wants to talk about the details.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The attitude and bureaucracy within the Space Agency are clearly threatening a burgeoning growth industry, killing the enthusiasm and making customers wary. Recently on <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Corners</span> Minister Andrews said that there are opportunities that we need to grab with both hands. I'm very confident she didn't mean around the throat and strangling the life out of them. The Space Agency has a regulatory role, but it is also has a role to assist a commercial industry, not hinder it. So my message to the leadership of the Space Agency is: it's not good enough. Dr Clark, Mr Murfett, you are on notice. I will measure you not by the glossy brochures or by the number of MOUs you sign but how you use those MOUs to assist Australian industry and how you use the agency to progress our industry. I don't recall President Kennedy saying the US was going to the moon provided they get the bureaucracy right.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CHANDLER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:45</span>):  Last week in the Senate I spoke about World Rugby's efforts to defend the integrity and safety of women's sport by ensuring women's rugby is for female players. At the end of my speech, I referenced the recent case of a woman being fired from her job for speaking about the reality of biological sex. I posed the question:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">How do Australians know that they are able to speak freely about women's rights and the reality of biological sex without being censured or fired by their employer?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, it didn't take long to get the answer to that question. The answer is that Australians are not free to acknowledge the realities of sex or to defend the integrity of women's sport.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today I received a letter from the Tasmanian equal opportunity commission, summoning me to attend a conciliation conference to answer for my statements on free speech and sex based rights. The complaint, made under the Tasmanian Anti-Discrimination Act, is in relation to an op-ed I had published in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Mercury</span> earlier this year about, quite ironically, free speech. My op-ed started:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The recent publication of an open letter signed by 150 writers and academics in defence of free speech offers a glimmer of hope that we can put a stop to the anti-democratic cancel culture which has taken root in many corners of society.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, I'm not so sure about there being a glimmer of hope for free speech now. The complaint letter I received today says, in referencing my actions: 'It is clear or can be inferred from her comments that she considers people who are born male and seek to live as a female should not have access to female toilets, facilities or sports. This is problematic because excluding someone who is designated male at birth and currently expresses their gender as female from single-sex facilities or sport may be direct discrimination on the basis of gender identity.' It is open to the commissioner to dismiss the complaint as vexatious but without substance, but she has chosen instead to pursue it and to compel me to attend a compulsory mediation with the complainant.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another part of the complaint relates to my response to an email I received after my op-ed on free speech was published. The email I received asked me to clarify if I understand the difference between sex and gender. In my reply, I said: 'I do understand the difference. That's why I've made the point in my article that women's sports, women's toilets and women's changing rooms are designed for people of the female sex and should remain that way.' The commissioner has found that this sentence could be considered offensive, intimidating, insulting, ridiculing or humiliating. The commissioner goes on to say in her letter to me, 'It is arguable that, following shifts towards unisex toilets, it is no longer necessary to have separate toilets based on sex.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The complainant and indeed the anti-discrimination commissioner are perfectly free to disagree with me on this issue. Indeed, they are both perfectly free to never cast a vote for me as a senator for Tasmania if they don't wish to do so. But I'm quite sure there are plenty of Tasmanians who do agree with me on this. They have every right to have their say and for their views to be represented in the federal parliament by people such as myself. It is deeply concerning that, in a democracy, instead of using free speech to respond and perhaps even campaign against me in an election, some people are seeking to use the law to silence me and every Tasmanian who shares my concerns. Being summoned by a quasi-judicial body to appear and explain why I say that males shouldn't be in female changing rooms or in female sporting competitions is an indictment on the state of free speech in this country. It is yet another example of the assault on truth and the assault on the very meaning of the word 'woman' by activists who are determined to remove every sex based right that women around the world have and allow anyone who identifies as a woman into women's sports and women's spaces.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will not be silenced. Unlike 24 million other Australians, I am fortunate to have this platform in our nation's parliament to be able to speak and be heard. This complaint, just like the complaints and the legal actions in recent years against others for saying what they believe in, sends a clear and chilling message to every Australian—that free speech is dramatically under threat in this country. It sends a message that if you say something that an activist movement somewhere doesn't like then you will be hauled before a tribunal and punished. And it sends a message that, no matter how ludicrous the demands of activists are, you must comply or face the consequences. I and millions of others will not submit ourselves to the demands of those who deny reality. I will not accept this outrageous incursion on the free speech of every Australian.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Northern Territory</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:50</span>):  I rise to speak on the passing of two Aboriginal leaders in the last few months whose funerals I attended. Labor Party stalwart Mr John Ah Kit, known to most as 'JAK', was the first Aboriginal cabinet minister in the Northern Territory, serving in the seat of Arnhem for 10 years, from 1995 the 2005. Prior to that, he served as director of the Northern Land Council from 1984 to 1990 and as executive director of the Jawoyn Association in Katherine, where he was much respected. I succeeded Mr Ah Kit in the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly when he retired from politics in 2005. I will forever be grateful for his mentorship and friendship.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Ah Kit leaves a legacy for the next generation of leaders. He was cheeky, he was stubborn, had a hard head and yet was so determined to see a better Northern Territory for all people. These traits clearly pushed him in every area of his life to encourage all of us who knew him to do better. He bled true blue for his beloved Darwin Buffalos. I pay my respects to his wife, Gail, and children—Ngaree, Darren, Jonathan—and their families. I commend Ngaree for her successful re-election as the member for Karama during what was an incredibly difficult personal time for her. Mr Ah Kit was remembered in a state funeral at TIO Stadium in Marrara on 22 July.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also wish to pay my respects to the family of Mr Robert Tipungwuti, whose funeral took place at St Mary's Cathedral in Darwin on 10 July. Mr Tipungwuti served as chairman of the Tiwi Land Council from 2006 to 2012. He was passionate about maintaining Tiwi language and about speaking Tiwi at home. I recall Mr Tipungwuti on one of the Indigenous advisory councils when I was Indigenous Affairs Minister in the Northern Territory and he was always reminding me and others of the importance of homelands and outstations. He was enormously passionate about the need for First Nations people to have the opportunities to grow their business, their ventures on their own lands and that is something that has always stayed with me. He was committed to assisting the Tiwi people in the development of both Melville and Bathurst islands. My deepest condolences to his wife, children, grandchildren and great-grandchildren.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Australian Greens in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:53</span>):  [by video link] Over the last six months, the world's attention has understandably been diverted to the response to the COVID-19 crisis. This afternoon I want to draw this chamber's attention to the human rights abuses that continue to occur unabated around the world in spite of the pandemic. In some cases, the abuses have been exacerbated by the pandemic. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade said this week that COVID-19 has fuelled authoritarian trends. As the UN Special Rapporteur, on the situation of human rights defenders, recently said, the pandemic means that we need to do more to protect human rights activists.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the short time I have available today, it's not possible to traverse all the atrocities occurring globally, but I wanted to mention a few. In India, Prime Minister Modi is rounding up critics in the shadow of the virus. Indian authorities have arrested dozens in a nationwide crackdown, with arrests based on scant evidence. Those who have been detained include a youth activist who raised awareness of police violence against Muslims, an academic who opposes the government's dangerous anti-Muslim citizenship law, and a co-founder of a women's collective. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Authorities continue to impose harsh and discriminatory measures in Kashmir just over a year after the Indian government drastically eroded Kashmiris' right to self-determination. To quell dissent and to keep away news from the outside world, it continues to maintain stifling restraints, with widespread detention and drastic limits to the internet, to name a few abuses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the Philippines, Duterte's brutal drug war goes on. The UN found in June that thousands had been killed in the so-called war with near impunity. Duterte's government has given police permission to kill. Along with ordinary Filipinos, human rights activists must also fear for their lives. Only a few weeks ago, unidentified gunmen fatally shot human rights worker Zara Alvarez. Separately, peasant leader Randall Echanis was also murdered. They were the 13th and 14th human rights workers killed in the Philippines in the last four years. They had been subject to so-called red-tagging or political harassment. Their deaths show that extrajudicial killings in the Philippines remain rife in COVID times.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In China, egregious abuses against the Uighur people go on, exacerbated by the pandemic. We continue to see mass arbitrary detention, surveillance, indoctrination and the destruction of heritage, as well as forced birth control. What we are seeing is cultural genocide of the Uighur people, and it is abhorrent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A bit further afield in Ethiopia, the government begun a crackdown following the killing of popular Oromo artist and activist Hachalu Hundessa. Authorities have detained dozens of opposition members and journalists for prolonged periods, often without charge. Members of the Oromo community in Australia have raised their serious concerns with Greens MPs. Ethiopian authorities must bring credible charges against those detained or release them, and there should be an independent investigation into Mr Hundessa's killing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The cases I've just mentioned are only the tip of the iceberg. I could go on, but unfortunately I'm limited by time. I urge the government to actively call out global atrocities and abuses, even as our attention is turned inward to our domestic response to the COVID-19 pandemic.</span>
