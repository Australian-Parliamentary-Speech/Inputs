         last night said that they had some concern that the GST would actually be increased following introduction. This is a well placed concern, and it is borne out by what has happened in a number of significant countries. For instance, in the United Kingdom the rate was introduced at 10 per cent in April 1973 and is now 17.5 per cent. In New Zealand it started off at 10 per cent in May 1986 and is now 12.5 per cent. In Denmark it was introduced at 10 per cent—

We have had this talk from the Leader of the Opposition that one of the great things about a consumption tax is that it is one rate on everything. Most countries in the table have split rates, such as Belgium, which started off at 6, 14, 18 per cent and is now 1, 6, 17, 19, 25, 33 per cent. France started off at 6.4, 13.6, 20, 25 per cent and is now 2.1, 4.5, 5, 18.6, 22 per cent. Germany was 5 and 10 per cent and is now 7 and 14 per cent. The Netherlands was 4 and 12 per cent and is now 6 and 18.5 per cent. Not only have they all risen but, as well as that, most of them are split rates systems, which means that many governments around the world have decided that it is too pernicious, too nasty—

I am simply making the point that in most countries where there is a consumption tax they are split rates. People do not accept the fact. The point is that in nearly all of the examples the rates have risen sharply, dramatically, significantly, from the date of introduction. So the fear expressed by the person being interviewed by

        In fact, what he said is that the reforms set out in the document are designed to provide two million jobs. By yesterday it degraded to `it was reasonable to aim for'. Maybe we could qualify this further: it was decidedly reasonable to aim for—by a certain time at least, but it was reasonable to aim for—at least two million jobs by the end of the decade.

         That is a matter of acute embarrassment to the Leader of the Opposition. He is trying to obscure the fact that the Opposition's proposals do not return bracket creep, except in some form of compensation for the introduction of the GST. Having dodged and ducked about this question, at least the Leader of the Opposition had the candour, accidental or otherwise, to reveal this last night in his press statement. He said:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        We are committed to the return of bracket creep revenue and have demonstrated how this can be done. The $3 billion in bracket creep included in the `Fightback!' costing goes towards the funding of the overall package, including the abolition of other indirect taxes and compensation payments, such as family allowances and pensions.
       </para>
       <para>
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
        </emphasis>
        In other words, the bracket creep compensation is not there to compensate people for the inflationary impact of a new tax; it is there to maintain the circumstances of somebody whose taxation position would otherwise vary as a result of the impact of inflation. Those opposite are trying to have it both ways. They are trying to say, `We are returning bracket creep but, by the way, we are using it in a form to compensate for the deliberate inflationary impact of our measure—our food and clothing tax—which will, of course, add considerably to the cost of living for every Australian'.

         That is why the Opposition is trying to raise this issue now. I repeat: we have more than adjusted our tax scales to take account of bracket creep. That is something which the Opposition has not done, as will be revealed perfectly in an hour or so.

         I noticed today that the former Secretary to the Treasury and a former National Party senator, Mr John Stone, said:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Treasury have always, under Governments of all complexions, done so-called costings of packages of policies put together by Oppositions of the day. They always, I think, as far as I am aware, attempted to be quite scrupulous in their professional approach to that operation, which clearly has a high political content attaching to it, and therefore not appropriate for the Department to involve itself in that high political content.
       </para>
       <para>
        He went on:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I have seen a little half of some of the document, and my quick impression of it is, is that it is a professional exercise.
       </para>
       <para>
        He said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        It is a modelling exercise by the Treasury, which from a purely technical point of view, is an advance on anything that we've seen before in this country. They've set up a model. You can argue and I think the Opposition last year did suggest that this was improper, I don't think that charge can be sustained. The Treasury's job is of course to produce assessments of the economy, including assessments of particular policy proposals for change.
       </para>
       <para>
        That was the view of a former coalition senator. But, of course, in the face of these claims about the decline in living standards of 70 per cent of Australian households and four out of five taxpayers being worse off, we had the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in a show with what will go down—I will not use the words `go down in infamy' because those words have too historic a connotation to them; it does not deserve that—as one of the most shabby political performances of all time. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition got asked:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Are there any losers under Fightback?
       </para>
       <para>
        He replied, `Yes of course there are. . . smokers are losers'. Not any of the four out of five Australian taxpayers who have been kidded into believing that there is a benefit for them or any of 70 per cent of Australian households who have been kidded by the Opposition that there is a benefit—no, only smokers!
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         In answer to another question, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition said:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The package is basically progressive. . . Our package delivers the greatest benefit to those in greatest need.
       </para>
       <para>
        Yes, the wealthy! How can it be progressive as a flat rate of tax on goods and services across the economy? With inadequate compensation packages and inadequate tax cuts how can it be progressive? It is just a bald claim. He was then asked by Andrew Olle:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        So it is one thing to say we expect inflation to be down, but I mean you can't guarantee it is going to be down, can you?
       </para>
       <para>
        He replied:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . we have an anti-inflation strategy. . .
       </para>
       <para>
        That was it—there was no more about it. There was no explanation. He did not tell us how inflation would come down. He told us only that the Opposition had a strategy. The Deputy Leader of the Opposition then said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Some people who have the capacity might buy a copy of Fightback for $35 and do the calculations.
       </para>
       <para>
        In other words, what they do not know will not hurt them; they can work it out for themselves with the desktop calculator and the computer to go through the modelling exercise. Mr Olle then said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        The fact is though Mr Reith that that basket that your Leader put out as an average representative situation—
       </para>
       <para>
        this was the shopping basket—
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        was in fact a gross distortion and the suspicion has to be in people's minds, why isn't your model like that?
       </para>
       <para>
        The Deputy Leader of the Opposition replied:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I know there is harpic and you know too many cans of pet food, but the point is—
       </para>
       <para>
        The Minister for Finance made this point before: if you want to live on Harpic and pet food, then you are fine. These things were taxed under the wholesale sales tax. To put them into the basket means that there is less of an effect from the consumption tax. Of course, Mr Olle made the dreadful point of saying:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Like bread, milk and meat were virtually left out.
       </para>
       <para>
        But the shadow Treasurer said, `But you didn't mention the abolition of payroll tax and fuel tax'. He then said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Well it is representative as far as it went.
       </para>
       <para>
        He finally conceded that the basket was `representative as far as it went'. It was an unbelievable performance in political obfuscation, an unbelievable performance in slipping and sliding all over the ABC floor—slippin' and a-slidin'. All we needed was a bit of the Coasters and the Drifters with you and it would have been a real show. But the fact is, Mr Speaker, that it showed that the Opposition thought that there would be no distributional analysis of the GST package and that, if there was one, it would never rate a
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Four Corners
        </emphasis>
        program and hard questions like these would never be asked. When they were asked, what did we get from the Leader of the Opposition? That it was a blatant ABC-Treasury exercise that will go down in history as a dirty tricks campaign. Does that not say it all?

         we have references to the Murphy model. It was the Murphy model on which the Opposition tried to demonstrate that it would be able to create a certain number of jobs. But in creating that certain number of jobs what does it do under scenario 3 to inflation in 1993-94, 1994-95 and 1995-96? The inflation rate in those three years is 6.5, 7.7 and 5.9 per cent. Surely, Treasury was entitled to use those inflationary figures, the preferred scenario of the Opposition, in working out what would be the inflation rate by which the tax scales would have to be adjusted in order to return bracket creep to the taxpayers. That is the basis on which the analysis was done. It was the preferred scenario of the Opposition's. It was the inflation rate which was given by it, not made up by us.

         —Obviously, two things would be necessary. First of all, one would need to compensate Australians, whether they be taxpayers or not, for the price impact of the introduction of such a tax. The whole point of the introduction of this tax—it is, after all, the main idea in the Opposition's proposals—is that all Australians should pay their tax as they consume. Every Australian would be confronted with this new food and clothing tax, which would, as we know, raise $27 billion—on the figuring of those opposite—or something like $23 a week for every man, woman and child in Australia. The way in which that would be imposed has an impact on prices and, therefore, has an impact on the disposable incomes available to Australian families.

         So the first thing that has to be done as a result of the introduction of this measure would be to fully compensate families, households, for the price impact of the introduction of this new tax and the other measures which are associated with the Opposition's proposals.

         The second point is that, as well as doing that, taxpayers need to be compensated for this bracket creep phenomenon which, if bracket creep is not taken care of, means that a taxpayer with the same real income over time ends up paying more tax than he otherwise would, simply as a result of the inflationary impact and the interaction between the higher rate of money wages and the tax scales that operate at any particular time.

         These are the two tests which the Opposition had to satisfy if it was going to make this heroic claim that all Australians were going to be winners as a result of this proposal. As will be demonstrated soon enough, 70 per cent of households would be worse off, four out of five taxpayers would be worse off, and that is because the Opposition has the compensation package wrong and the bracket creep wrong. The Opposition has, not surprisingly, overcompensated those who are on the highest income and it has considerably undercompensated many others in the community. As a result I think the Opposition is guilty of trying to pull a cruel hoax on the Australian people as it makes out through its claims and some of these fictitious examples, which it includes in these statements, that people will be better off when obviously they will be worse off.

         These are as summarised in some of the data released today. Our international debts have risen to $183 billion in gross terms; that is about $145 billion in net terms. We are in the deepest recession in 60 years, with nearly one million Australians unemployed, and yet the Government goes on trying in a massive way to con the people of Australia into believing that it is fit and proper to govern this country. The Government will stop at nothing to win the next election. As far as the Government is concerned, there is no principle so sacred that it cannot be dropped, no allegation so incredible that it cannot be made, no rule so honoured that it cannot be bent and no institution so important that it cannot be undermined.

         In recent years we have seen this Government undermine some of the major institutions in this country for its own political ends. For example, there was the position of the High Court of Australia a few years ago in relation to the postage allowance. The Government deliberately went out to circumvent the High Court ruling. When the Industrial Relations Commission has failed to give it the support it needs for its so-called attempted wages policy, the Government has sought to circumvent the Industrial Relations Commission. As Treasurer, the present Prime Minister (Mr Keating) boasted on several occasions about how he had the Treasury in one pocket and the Reserve Bank of Australia in the other and `They do what I tell them to do'.

          Four Corners

I felt that with such a long interview a transcript was essential—

The Prime Minister undermined him but had no idea of what to do. He brought down his One Nation statement last week and he still has no idea what to do. Nothing in that statement is going to address the fundamental problems in this country.

It took two Opposition parties to put aside the political risks, to call the situation honestly and to get on and deal with the problems of this country as we know they should be dealt with and as people all over Australia know they should be dealt with.

         The One Nation statement that was brought down last week is a most disgraceful effort. As I said last week, it probably will prove to be the most irresponsible package since the days of Jack Lang and the Lang plan. Does the Prime Minister remember him? Jack Lang taught the Prime Minister all he knows, and that ain't much. All the elements of the Prime Minister's approach to economics—even some of the lines he has used in this Parliament—have come from Jack Lang. He will remember that Jack Lang's main claim to fame was when the going got tough he would repudiate our international debts. Today the international debts of this country have risen to $183 billion, and I wonder how long it is going to be before Jack Lang's protege starts to talk about why we do not need to pay back all this international debt.

         —Yes. As my colleague reminds me, we have a new approach to the approval of development projects in this One Nation statement. The only thing is there are no private projects going ahead. There is a new approach: `We are going to streamline it right through, and the decision will go right through'. But nothing is going to come out the other end because nothing is going to be decided. The Prime Minister had a chance to prove his bona fides. He could have proved his bona fides by reversing the decision on Coronation Hill. It was a small but very symbolic decision of his bona fides. He could have scrapped the three mines uranium policy, which his predecessor at least had the strength of character to say was illogical. He could have scrapped the three mines uranium policy and we could have gone ahead and seen some uranium mines developed, or he could have included some references to some of those pulp mills, iron ore mines and other projects that are sitting there tied up with red tape, black tape or regulation and government inactivity and inertia in the midst of the worst recession in 60 years.

         All we have seen since the package of the Prime Minister was brought down are newspaper reports to the effect that other projects are not going ahead. That is a very good example of how you fail to address basic problems—for example, in getting development projects off the ground, dealing with labour market reform, genuinely reforming our rail system and our transportation system, genuinely reforming aviation, genuinely cleaning up the waterfront, doing something about coastal shipping and trans-Tasman shipping, and doing something about the real infrastructure. You do not have an answer. You have gone on an uncontrolled spending spree to try to buy your way back into government. As I said the other night, if you do not have the money, you cannot spend it. It was grossly irresponsible to bring down that package knowing that all it is going to do is further compound our debt problems, further compound our interest rate problems and risk further delaying this country's process of recovery.

         I think it is important to finish with a few remarks about the distributional impact of the Prime Minister's One Nation statement. Today I asked the Prime Minister to release a comparable Treasury distributional analysis of his One Nation statement. You have spent hundreds of thousands—probably millions—of dollars of public sector money, not only in your dirty tricks but in using the public sector to analyse our Fightback package. Even with the detail of what you are going to table today, you are yet to lay a glove on our Fightback package. You make a whole lot of innovative assumptions, but you spent millions of dollars of taxpayers' money. The lights in Treasury have been visible for hours into the night for weeks on end since late November, when that package was brought down, with Treasury trying to undermine this package.

         When we look at that analysis, we find a number of major differences between you and us. Firstly, we paid for ours and you have not paid for yours. Secondly, we actually give tax cuts right up the scale, and genuinely reform personal tax, including about four million low income earners who earn under about $20,700. Under you they will get nothing by way of a tax cut, compared with a substantial tax cut under us in our taxation reform. That means that half the taxpayers in Australia—in effect, half the work force in Australia—the bottom group, those who earn under $20,700, including pensioners and retirees, a very heavy concentration of women, and farmers, are in the group that, to use Sir Robert Menzies's term, you have made the forgotten people of Australia. Four million of them!

         In conclusion, there is a very serious point to be made: $183 billion worth of debt calls for major change in Australia. We need a generational change of attitudes, values and policies. We need to go back to the early 1970s. The generational shift that took place—it started with Whitlam, was continued by Hawke and is being finalised by the Prime Minister—has to be put behind us, otherwise our children and our grandchildren are going to face restricted employment opportunities, restricted educational opportunities and a lower standard of living. It would be the first time any generation in Australia has ever left a lower standard of living to their children than they have enjoyed themselves. That is why you should not be playing dirty tricks. You should be getting on and doing the job.

Unlike the Government, he never sat back and said, as we did recently, `What should we do now that is best for Australia? Let's ask business; let's ask the unions; let's ask the States.

         —The truth is that this has been a grubby campaign of misinformation to try to mislead the Australian public about a proposition that this fraudulent Prime Minister five years ago supported publicly. He said it all yesterday in Question Time. A classic question was put to him. We have a debate which, for many people, when taken to its extremes, is a very complex, sophisticated debate about economics. People naturally enough say, `Well, you know, it is a bit hard to know who to believe of all the experts'.

         In the last month or so, the Prime Minister has appointed a new principal economic adviser. He hand-picked an economic adviser—the best he could find—to provide him with advice on economics. It just so happens that this principal economic adviser, just a month or so ago, prior to his appointment with the Prime Minister, wrote an article giving his views publicly about what he thought of the Fightback package. What he said is very interesting. This article is entitled `The tax package deconstructed'. In the second sentence—this is the Prime Minister's own adviser—he says:

        It is certainly the boldest and most detailed proposal to change the federal budget for a very long time.

       <para first-indent="16" font-size="-=2">

         There is no doubt that the package is breathtaking, and it would be quite wrong to dismiss it out of hand. For one thing, abolishing payroll tax is a good thing by almost any standard.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para>
        Not by the Prime Minister's standards, but by almost any standards. I continue:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Abolishing the wholesale sales tax and replacing it with a tax on final consumption is a defensible reform to an unsatisfactory method of revenue-raising.
       </para>
       <para>
        Dead right. That is the advice the Prime Minister has been getting. Yet he has the gall to stand here and say the opposite when he knows it is not true. And furthermore from Professor Edwards:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . there does appear to be a plausible effort to arrange the tax cuts and the social security compensation so that the poor are not worse off as a result of the imposition of the goods and services tax.
       </para>
       <para>
        Another point to the Opposition. Those opposite are running a scare campaign saying that people will be worse off when the Prime Minister's principal economic adviser says that that claim is not true. Point No. 3 to the Opposition. He goes on to say:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . I don't think it is worth arguing that a goods and services tax will cause inflation (as distinct from a one time increase in the price level) or recession. It might, but in reasonable circumstances it will not.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Prime Minister's principal economic adviser completely took the ground from beneath his feet. It shows what extraordinary hypocrisy there is and what a campaign of misinformation these people run when the Prime Minister stands in the Parliament. In respect of lower income people he said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . the compensation for lower income social security recipients appears to be generous.
       </para>
       <para>
        That was the advice to the Prime Minister, yet the Prime Minister has the gall to come in here and say the opposite to try to scare people against the GST. Near the end of his article Professor Edwards said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        But the arithmetic issues are not as important as I expected them to be in this package, because the claim for the black economy is not as great as I thought, and because there is no apparent claim made for the incentive and growth effects of the package on revenue.
       </para>
       <para>
        Most of the Government's attacks on the package are on the basis of arithmetic, but the Government's principal economic adviser in the Prime Minister's office, hand-picked by the Prime Minister himself, shows what a furphy, what a campaign of misrepresentation, we have on that issue. He said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        No doubt the Treasury re-estimation of the package will produce different numbers, but they may not all be one way and it is quite likely that the arithmetic will be not be decisive to a judgement of the package.
       </para>
       <para>
        Dead right! Picked it, in fact! And here today we finally have the tabling of these numbers. Lastly, he said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . . . it may well inhibit employment more than a goods and services tax does. At the very worst, a substitution of a goods and services tax for payroll tax will do no harm and may do a great deal of good.
       </para>
       <para>
        Again, that is a point to the Opposition. It reveals that this Prime Minister's advice from the bureaucracy supports the coalition's Fightback package, yet again the Prime Minister has the gall to come in here to misrepresent, to distort and to run a campaign of misinformation to suit his own political ends.

         Yesterday we asked the question of the Prime Minister: what do you say about the fact that your principal economic adviser reckons it is a pretty good package? Do honourable members know what the Prime Minister said? He said, `Well, I was not paying him when he said that'. What an exposure! What a revelation! In other words, here we have the whole of Treasury saying exactly what the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) and the Prime Minister want it to say because it is under the thumb of this Government. The truth is that the Prime Minister and the Treasurer are prepared to do anything, to say anything or to use anything, including the Treasury, the ABC or those families on the ABC last night, just to run their campaign.

         If we want to come to the bottom line as to the Government's position, we can look at its real position, firstly, on the basis of the advice that it has had and, secondly, from the position that the Government itself has supported over the years. Most Australians remember that the Prime Minister wanted a reform of this sort—not as grand, admittedly, but he wanted a reform of this sort—a few years ago. But he was unable to get it through his Party as a result of the imposition of a veto by the trade union movement in a motel room in Canberra one night in 1985. That is the truth of the matter, and all this smoke and cloud and rhetoric and hyperbole about people being better off is simply a campaign of misinformation.

I do not want honourable members to jump to any conclusions about this because I am not to reveal the contents of it until it has been tabled, but I think we will find, as we go through this document, this claim of an impartial bureaucracy, working all hours of the night on every floor of Treasury, lit up like a Christmas tree from the basement to the top, working with one aim in mind—to attack the Opposition. That is not what Treasury is there for. It is supposed to be there to help the good management of this economy—not to attack the Opposition.

         The involvement of the ABC in this matter raises serious questions about the integrity of the ABC. We are prepared to have an honest and open debate about these issues and, to back up the Fightback program we released last year, we have released more material than any Opposition has ever released. The ABC rang my office some time ago and asked, `Would you be prepared to go on television and have a debate about the implications of Fightback?'. My answer was, `Of course we are', because we are prepared to debate the issues. So we spoke to the ABC in the days leading up to yesterday. The arrangement was that, so that Andrew Olle and I could have a face to face interview, I would go to Sydney last night to discuss the program. I was told that I would be shown the clip of the program that would run before we had the one-to-one debate. So I went down there—and I must say that the ABC was very helpful about this, with taxpayers' money—on a commercial flight and I was picked up in a helicopter, which was a great flight across to—

         We have called for those documents for a couple of months under the Freedom of Information Act. It is not a question of our not wanting the documents; we have been trying to extract documents from this Government for months. It is like extracting teeth because it does not want to tell anything unless it happens to suit it. So how convenient it was that the night before the Government was to run its big attack on the coalition it just so happened that our friends in the ABC had this opportunity to give us the curtain raiser for the attack by the Prime Minister.

Let me tell honourable members something that those people know. They know what a value added tax does; they know why it is there. That value added tax in the United Kingdom is to support unsupportable agricultural subsidies which discriminate against Australian agricultural products. They know why that tax is there. They know a couple of other things about this tax. They know that that tax has been increasing exponentially since it was introduced. They know that, once it is in place and there is a government that wants to slip slide around the issues of its fiscal management, the easiest thing for a government to do is to not raise income taxes but to ramp up the GST. The people in my electorate who come from Britain know that, and they know what the Opposition is about. It is about creating a massive cornucopia for governments that are prepared in the future to be irresponsible, and they will do it at the expense of the ordinary people in this country and not the high earning taxpayers.

They would believe, and be entitled to believe, I suppose, that it is, in all its aspects, similar to the British value added tax; but it is not. The British value added tax does not go on the necessities of life. What makes the Opposition's GST virtually unique amongst all value added taxes around the globe is that it will be imposed on the necessities of life. That is what makes so heinous that exchange of enormous tax benefits for upper income people in return for a massive tax pay-out by those who spend virtually all their income on the necessities of life. They do not know that. But do not worry about the British people in my electorate, because between now and the next election they are going to find that out. They are going to be informed about that element of the value added tax that is proposed by the Opposition.

         The Leader of the Opposition now comes in with his taxonomy of sins to be applied in every censure debate, after an appropriate three-minute introduction, and one of the things that he has been on about is the question of micro-economic reform. I am sick of sitting here and listening to this because I wait all the time for his evidence. We get assertion; we get no evidence. We hear, `The Government has not done what it ought to do. The railways are all terribly inefficient'. Opposition members are not aware, of course, that the expenditure in the national rail freight program is dependent on work practice efficiencies and those work practice efficiencies are being negotiated with the relevant unions.

         As to the waterfront, the Prime Minister somewhat undersold himself. He said that the productivity efficiencies on the waterfront were around 50 per cent. It is true, as he says, that by the end of this year there will be a 50 per cent reduction in the work force, but the productivity rates of improvement are 60 per cent and upwards, so a much higher rate of productivity is being achieved on the waterfront. The Leader of the Opposition claimed, for example, that there had been a massive increase in idle time since these reforms had been allegedly put in place. Last year the cost of idle time fell by 80 per cent. Idle time levies were abolished at the end of last year with the move to full enterprise employment in major ports.

         He has not even bothered to look at what has been put in place in the waterfront; he has not bothered to look at what has been put in place as far as our railway systems are concerned. Others normally associated with the political persuasion of the Leader of the Opposition have done so. Let me quote the New South Wales Chamber of Commerce last month. These are people who actually keep up to date as far as waterfront reform is concerned. In its report,

        The Leader of the Opposition's problem is that he has to go not only on what he concedes are the facts, but also on what he hates. We are dealing with a prejudiced party; it has people it hates. Among those people that it most sincerely hates are waterfront employees, against whom they would direct the full force of the military—that is its position as far as waterfront employees are concerned. It hates the Australian Broadcasting Commission; it hates the
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Four Corners
        </emphasis>
        program; it hates the
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Sydney Morning Herald

        ; it hates Treasury; it hates the Reserve Bank of Australia and it hates the board director of the Reserve Bank. It is a party not of policy so much as a mishmash of paranoias and hatreds that it seeks to engage the rest of the Australian community in joining. That is the position adopted by the Opposition.

         However, on this question of micro-economic reform, it comes up against one thing: unfortunately for it politically but fortunately for the country economically, by the time we come to face the people at the next election, the major, solid work of work practice reform, both as far as the national railways system and the waterfront are concerned, will be complete. There will be no more to be done there, apart from around the edges as far as productivity is concerned.

         At the end of the day when we arrive and have reformed the waterfront system there will be an irreducible minimum problem, although it will be in the process of being addressed. That is the infrastructure that has been in place in some areas for the best part of a century. In the end one can make all the changes in work practices that one likes, but most productivity in a contemporary capitalist society is not a product of work practice changes—important as they are—but of technology by a massive margin. Sooner or later one has to confront the technological problem on the waterfront and in the railway system.

         There is nothing in Fightback which addresses that, not one line. As far as this Government and the people are concerned this issue needs to be addressed with dollars. One cannot evade that; it has to be spent by someone, either the Government or the private sector. The Government has put in place the means by which the private sector can do some spending if it wishes but if it does not wish to—and it is not a noted investor in infrastructure even with taxation breaks—the Government will do the job. That is why the employment estimates, as far as the Government is concerned, are so much better than the employment estimates that come out of the Opposition's package.

         There is one other thing that the Opposition persists on talking about in Fightback, and that is education. As far as Fightback is concerned the Opposition has nothing to say on education for employment and training beyond the practical impact of what it has had to say about TAFE, which would produce a net reduction on what the Government was spending before it put in place the statement of last week and now by a massive margin is a reduction on what the Government is putting forward. If one does not implement what the Government has said ought to be implemented in this area, our young people will not be trained and will not have those vocational opportunities.

         Part of this persiflage and mad argument on his part about this or that statistic is a smokescreen to cover a problem that he now very substantially has and knows he has. His figures did not add up before that statement; they now do not add up by truly massive margins. His cuts are not sufficient but they are enough to disadvantage virtually everyone in this community who earns under $20,000 to put the Opposition's program in place. He must now make some choices and he makes those choices against what he has done; he makes choices against essential micro-economic reform for this economy and essential employment creation in this economy if our people are to get out of the situation in which they now find themselves. He is in big trouble; he knows it, hence this motion. This motion is not worth the paper it is written on and we can now vote on it. I move:

         On 26 November 1991, the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), on behalf of the Opposition parties, tabled in this House a document entitled
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Fightback!
         </emphasis>
         which contained, among other things, the Opposition's taxation and expenditure proposals for the next Federal elections. The monument of the package is the proposed imposition of a new tax of 15 per cent on the purchase and consumption—by every Australian—of nearly all goods and services. This would raise, on the Opposition's figuring, some $27.2 billion.

         For many years, it has been recognised as being in the public interest for the policies of the `alternative government' of the day to be costed and analysed in terms of their economic and social impacts, in much the same way as policy proposals of the government of the day are subjected to rigorous official analysis and testing. In accordance with this long established practice—observed by successive governments of all political persuasions—the Opposition's consumption tax proposals have been subjected to the official scrutiny of the Departments of Treasury and Finance.

         On 9 December 1991, my colleague the then Minister for Finance publicly released the Department of Finance costings of the Opposition's expenditure proposals as spelled out in its so-called Fightback package. A week later, on 16 December, the Minister made public the details of an analysis by the Treasury and the Australian Taxation Office of the revenue side of the package. The Treasury has also undertaken a distributional analysis of the Opposition's package which, as far as it is technically possible to do so, traces the complex and clouded money flows in the package and identifies the net financial impact on Australian households. This analysis was not publicly released ahead of the rising of the Parliament for the summer recess.

         On 18 December 1991, the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith) made an application under the Freedom of Information Act for access to documents provided between 19 November and 17 December to the then Treasurer and his predecessor by the Department of the Treasury and the Treasurer's Office which relate to the Opposition's consumption tax package. Upon the change in ministerial arrangements in late December and my assuming the responsibilities for the Treasury portfolio, I reviewed the documents which are the subject of the FOI application and I determined that as the documents are of general public interest, they should be tabled in this House within the first five sitting days of the next sitting, as provided for under section 21(1)(d) of the FOI Act. The documents I will be tabling today include three prepared within the Treasurer's Office itself—namely documents 1, 2 and 16.

         Honourable members will recall that, taken together, the costings prepared by the Departments of Finance and Treasury and the Taxation Office demonstrated that the Opposition's figuring on its package is fundamentally flawed. The proposed expenditure cuts are massively overstated to the order of $2.7 billion and revenue is understated to the order of $1.1 billion, giving a total funding shortfall in the package of nearly $4 billion. On the best information available to those official agencies that would have primary responsibility for the implementation of the package, it does not add up: it has a $4 billion hole. To that extent, the package is simply not capable of implementation unless it were to be fundamentally recast and reworked. How can the Opposition have got it so wrong?

        .the shortfall means that the Opposition could not fund the 8 per cent increase in social security and veterans' pensions and the 6 per cent increase in all other social security, education and training allowances. These are intended to compensate for the inflationary effect of the consumption tax—they have been costed by the Department of Finance at $2,374m in year three

       </para>
       <para>
        From these objective costings of the Opposition's package, it is quite clear that, if it were ever to win government, the Opposition's promises to compensate Australians for the introduction of its consumption tax could not be met. Perhaps this is what the Opposition Leader meant when he declared, in launching the package, `My concept of compassion isn't to compensate them for what I fail to deliver'.

        .that all groups in the community show increases in average disposable income after allowing for the effects of the consumption tax

         Detailed examination of the consumption tax package shows—contrary to the assertions of the Opposition—that there are, in fact, very few winners. Indeed, so far as it is possible to follow the consumption tax money trail and using the Opposition's methodology—and I will deal with the methodology in the Opposition's figuring in a moment—that trail leads to an outcome where over 70 per cent of households of full time wage and salary earners and about 60 per cent of self-employed and farmer households would be worse off under the Opposition's proposed arrangements.

         In particular, the Treasury analysis shows that wage and salary earner and self-employed and farm households on incomes of $90,000 a year and above would be better off by between $15 and $105 a week—that is, by up to $5,460 a year better off.

Similarly, self-employed and farm households with incomes up to $61,000 a year would be anything up to $12 a week worse off.

         Attachment 2 to this statement shows the full distributional results of the Treasury analysis before road user charges and the funding shortfall are allocated. Further, the Treasury analysis shows that, under the Opposition's preferred scenario C, on the tax measures alone—that is, not factoring in any other changes—all people paying tax on incomes below $40,000 a year would not be adequately compensated both for bracket creep and for the price effect of the Opposition's package. That is, the Opposition's own proposed tax scales would not compensate low and middle income earners for its new food and clothing tax.

         For example, a taxpayer on an income of $30,000 a year would receive a tax cut of 6.8 per cent under the Opposition's announced plan, but, after taking account of bracket creep and the CPI impact of the consumption tax, taxpayers on this income would still suffer a decline in real disposable income of some 2 per cent. Thus, while taxpayers on an income of $30,000 a year would be $9.20 a week worse off, people on $100,000 a year would be $73.20 a week better off. In other words, taxpayers on $30,000 would receive a tax cut which would be only about three-quarters of that necessary to compensate for the introduction of the consumption tax. But people on $100,000 would get a tax cut which is almost double that which would be adequate to compensate them for the reduction in their purchasing power.

Meanwhile, Treasury's analysis clearly shows that the vast majority of full time wage and salary earner households would see their real incomes fall.

And it has included as a benefit to households each and every `gain' which it has calculated to flow from personal income tax cuts and tax rebates, consumption tax credits, health tax credits and increases in government transfer payments.

         Currently, road users, through fuel excises and registration fees, contribute to government revenues more than is required to meet road expenditures. The Government, in consultation with the States, has been developing proposals for road user charges that seek to redistribute the charging burden according to road use. They do not aim to increase the amount of revenue raised from road users.

         Treasury has modelled the effects of an illustrative road  user charge based on vehicle registration fees designed to ensure that aggregate road expenditure is paid for by users.

         Accordingly, if the Opposition proceeded—as it has indicated it would— with registration based road user charges, on the reasonable assumption that they would be designed to recoup costs, these charges would add over one percentage point to the CPI impact of the Opposition's proposals. The total CPI effect of the Opposition's package would thus be 5.6 per cent—before the impact of the removal of the Medicare co-payment and wholesale sales tax changes on cars.

         What does this mean in terms of the Opposition's proposed compensation package? The short answer is that, combined with the other elements in the Opposition's package, the increases in registration fees would leave more than 80 per cent of full time wage and salary earner, self-employed and farm households worse off. The majority of full time wage and salary earner households would see real disposable income fall by between $5 and $35 per week, while the majority of self-employed and farm households would be between $4 and $22 per week worse off.

         —He can claw back as much as he likes. It shows that what these people have been saying for the last two months about the inflationary impact of our package is not true. We have just caught them red-handed. They actually say that the inflation impact is 3.9 per cent. In Fightback, we attempted to be conservative in everything we did. We bent over backwards so that we could not be open to a substantial detailed analysis where there might be some question mark as to whether we were right or wrong. I think this is a classic example of that. Treasury's inflation impact figure is lower than ours and it shows the porkies that we have had from these people for months. The Treasurer will not be able to continue with that campaign of misrepresentation in respect of inflation in the months ahead.

         It is also very interesting because the statement made by the Treasurer today goes further than that in respect of inflation. We say that the inflation impact of the package is 4.4 per cent, but if we included the tobacco excise it would be 4.7 per cent. When the Government has gone about concocting its figures it has jacked up that figure to take into account the effect of the increase in the excise. It is effectively mounting a claim that people who do not smoke should be compensated for the increase in the cost of fags. So, according to this lot, if you are a non-smoker you should get a compensatory increase, based on their methodology. It is amazing that they could put this forward. It is so obviously a false assertion.

         The Treasurer then goes on and pulls out the health charges—this is a ripper. The Government has a figure here. Apparently, we have to add another 0.3 per cent onto Medicare. It keeps jacking it up—it takes a bicycle pump to these figures and pumps them up as high as it possibly can. That is a good one. When the last Budget came down and Medicare changes were announced in it, we asked the Government what the CPI impact was. It said, `We wouldn't calculate that. Why would you put that in? In fact, you'd want a behavioural response from this change'. That is a good one. When it suits the Treasurer, he has it in; when it does not suit him, he has it out. It is straight dodgy stuff.

Of course, those opposite are the great experts on bracket creep. They have run high inflation, pushing people up through the tax scales just so that they pay more. They have had another $22 billion, as independently assessed, as a result of bracket creep, and they have not given it back.

         The second major point about bracket creep is that Treasury has made a major blunder in its calculations. Basically, it took the Fightback package and jacked up the inflation rate to jack up the tax paid by taxpayers and said that people would pay more. Treasury then said, `And you blokes aren't giving it back'. The inflation rate was jacked up to 6 per cent to 7 per cent, and Treasury then said, `That's the bracket creep that you're going to get, but you're not handing it back'.

         Of course, our projection in Fightback was based on earnings growth of about 3 1/2 per cent and an inflation rate of about 3 per cent, trending down over time. Treasury has made a major blunder. If one follows that methodology, we should have been given the revenue from that bracket creep, which we could have given back in additional tax cuts over and above that which we announced.

         This is an obvious mistake that one could make if one was doing VCE economics—and these blokes have missed the point. Why have they missed the point? Because it suits them to miss the point. They are that desperate to create a hole in this package, that we get this sort of blunder—this sort of mistake—from the Government. The truth is that Treasury forgot to factor in that if inflation were about 6 per cent to 7 per cent, there would be additional taxation revenue from bracket creep which would be available to give larger tax cuts.

His figures obviously do not add up.

As Professor John Edwards, the Prime Minister's principal economic adviser, said, this is a big plus for those who want to get a job. The abolition of those taxes means taking the tax off the business sector. Our package is unashamedly pro-business. We want our business community to be revived—big business, small business, businesses in between and the men and women on the land. That means jobs for people, that means money in their pockets and that means higher living standards in the future. We will remove $20 billion worth of tax from that productive sector of the Australian community. We will remove a $1.7 billion tax burden from our exporters and give them a chance to compete. By taking the tax burden off our manufacturing base we will allow Australian manufacturers to be more competitive against imports. That means that, instead of being penalised for employing Australians, they will be encouraged to employ Australians in Australian factories and produce in Australia. That is a very significant point, and I thank the Treasurer for making it. It is a pity he does not read it and understand it.

In 1985 the Treasury calculated a black economy figure, yet in 1991 it says that because it does not know the size of the black economy, it cannot assume any figure at all. No-one will believe that. On most academic and reasonable estimates the black economy in Australia is worth about 10 per cent of GDP, about $38 billion. And the Government is trying to say there is a whole—

It is a great idea, tax free savings, to encourage people to save. We do not allocate the benefits of the superannuation change. I just mention that because the Government is very keen to allocate absolutely everything, but it just happens not to allocate $2 billion worth of benefits. It is a case of, `Two billion bucks.

         —The Opposition clearly does not like to hear the facts of this matter. As I was saying, there is a shortfall of $2.6 billion in the Opposition's costings and on revenue there was a loss of well over $1 billion making a shortfall of $3.9 billion.

         That is a tremendous amount of money, almost a $4 billion shortfall in the Opposition's package, which is supposed to be fully funded with all the expenditures being met by the savings the Opposition is going to make through the package and with everything being totally paid for. However, the Opposition is $4 billion short; that was exposed months ago and the Opposition has had nothing to say about that at all except to throw it over its shoulder and hope it goes away. However, that $4 billion is crucial to things like supporting pensioners; for instance, the Opposition says it will compensate people on social security and veterans' pensions and other social security payments. That will cost $2.4 billion, but the Opposition is short by $4 billion. The Opposition claims it will spend another $1 billion on family allowances to compensate families for the GST and $565m for the reinsurance pool to stop health insurance premiums going through the roof.

         All these things add up to $3.9 billion and the Opposition cannot do any of these things if it does not have the money. The Opposition should not tell us that its proposal will look after people on the lowest incomes and on welfare when it cannot pay for it if it is to have a totally funded program because it is short by $3.9 billion. If the Opposition is not going to have that shortfall, clearly it cannot provide the compensation and part of the package has to fall away.

         The Opposition also claimed that two million jobs would flow from the package. That came out of scenario C, which the Opposition is now walking away from because it does not like some of its spin-offs, such as the increase in the foreign debt. It has already been proven that scenario C would produce fewer jobs and more debt between now and 1995-96 than the Opposition's own costing of the Government's One Nation package. Fewer jobs and more debts! Yet the Opposition says that this is something in the great interest of Australians.

         The inflation impact that would come from this package is in the order of 3.9 per cent at the very bottom, but if one adds in the health effect, which is absolutely essential because of the changes the Opposition is making to health insurance, as Treasury calculations show, the figure becomes 4.6 per cent. Since those calculations were made with the change in the co-payment arrangements and the cut in sales tax, the real figure is now 4.9 per cent. If one adds road user charges to that, to which the Opposition is absolutely committed in the Fightback statements, it will then have a 5.9 per cent inflation impact.

         So the Opposition will have a 5 per cent to 6 per cent inflation impact coming from the application of this package. What will that do to the level of inflation in this country? The Opposition says it will just disappear in 12 months, but why will it disappear in 12 months when at least 70 per cent of wage and salary earners will not be compensated? Does the Opposition think those people will sit there and say, `Well thank you very much, we are nowhere near compensated for this GST package but we will just cop this reduction in our real income and will not care about making a further wage claim'? Of course the people will make additional wage claims and of course that inflation will be built in unless the Opposition absolutely crunches the economy.

         This is a hopeless package in every possible respect. The Treasurer has shown in his analysis today that in the distributional area there is a sort of king hit; we have already punched so many holes in it that the package was totally without credibility, but this is the absolute knockout. It is quite clear that the great majority of Australians will be worse off as a result of this package and yet the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) said earlier today in that nonsense motion against the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) that the Government had not laid a glove on it. It was like Jeff Fenech last Sunday afternoon getting up after the fight and saying, `Well, that Azumah Nelson never laid a glove on me'.

         This package is without credibility—it is $4 billion short, and hopeless in its fiscal policy and its inflation and wages policy. It is without credibility in the area of distribution and it will be totally inequitable in what it does to income distribution in this country. The package engages in a massive fraud over tax bracket creep. It is saying to the Australian people, `Yes, we will give you back tax bracket creep. We are patting ourselves on the back; we are terrific; we will give it back to you, but we will give it back to you as compensation for a goods and services tax.'

         One gives tax bracket creep back not as compensation for another tax but as compensation for the creep itself because it is an increase in the average rate of income tax. If the Opposition gives it back as compensation for another tax, obviously that will be a total fraud. Yet that is what is being said to the Australian people—that the Opposition would give back tax bracket creep as compensation for another tax. A more absurd proposition has never been put to the Australian people and I do not know how the Opposition can stand up here and pretend to have any sort of seriousness and credibility when it puts such a proposal forward, with $3 billion-worth of tax bracket creep which should be given back anyway but which the Opposition will give back only as compensation for the GST.

That was complete and total nonsense and a fabrication which has been exposed by this document. It shows quite clearly, when one does the full analysis, that the vast majority of Australians are worse off.

         It is a massive document and the Government launched it as some kind of Scud missile, determined to knockout the Fightback package, but the truth of the matter is that the missile has backfired on the Government. So many quotes in this document show that the Government has been responsible and then, in other parts of the document where it has gone onto different criteria to assess the Fightback package, it shows how wrong it has it.

         It is always a pleasure to follow the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis). This is the man who was entrusted with the treasurership of Australia for a few brief weeks. The Government was not game enough to allow him the chance to fulfil his ambition and spend even one month in the office of Treasurer of this nation before he got axed by the new Prime Minister (Mr Keating) with the decision to put in Treasurer Dawkins.

         I say of the Minister for Finance:  his effort was slightly better than the efforts of the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) here today in respect of this debate, but it ignored some of the key qualifying statements in the briefing papers. One of those key qualifying statements, which I do not suppose those back bench members of the Government in that rabble up on the cross benches have got around to reading, was a note signed by Jim Wright, Assistant Project Director, Microeconomic Modelling Unit, which states:

        That is one heck of a qualifier appearing in the early part of the document, as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Reith) said earlier. What saddens me about this debate in particular is the fact that today we had both the balance of payments and the foreign debt figures for Australia released. On this very day, it was revealed that our current account deficit for January rose by $262m, or some 44 per cent. It was further revealed that rural exports fell by some $165m, or 12 per cent; non-rural exports fell by $143m, or 4 per cent, indicating that we as a country are still in grave economic crisis. Perhaps honourable members on both sides would agree with that much.

         The figures also showed that the net foreign debt rose by 4.3 per cent during the December quarter to $144.7 billion, which accounted for 75 per cent of the level of net foreign liabilities as at 31 December 1991. Australia finished calendar year 1991 with an increased massive foreign debt as a direct consequence of an economic recession that we did not have to have and as a direct consequence of this Government's and former Treasurer Keating's policies that led Australia into recession ahead of the rest of the world, took Australia into a deeper recession than many other parts of the world and is now denying Australia a fair dinkum recovery.

         Perhaps the public would like to know just how much has been involved in this massive effort on the Government's part. The Microeconomic Modelling Unit was established on 4 July. It was one of those big decisions made by then new Treasurer Kerin. However, he did not last; we have had Treasurer Keating, Treasurer Kerin, Treasurer Willis and now Treasurer Dawkins. The unit was established with eight staff, including one seconded from that great Department, the Department of Social Security.

Now that the modelling work of the MMU is basically complete, because it was drawn together just for the purposes of dealing with Fightback, the MMU is being disbanded and members of the unit will return to various divisions of the Department of the Treasury. However, the model will reside in the taxation policy division of Treasury and it is expected that some work will be done on updating it.

During this period, the jobless queues have been growing. There are now over one million people unemployed. The queues of people having to go to meals at community kitchens, which is a new name as they used to be called soup kitchens 60 years ago, have been growing. Today in 1992, 60 years after the Great Depression, there are four of these community kitchens in Albury-Wodonga as a direct consequence of the Government's economic policies.

         Record bankruptcies are flowing from the recession and many farmers are struggling—so much so that in one particular electorate, very sadly, just a few weeks ago, a farmer who was on notice from his bank to quit his property and be sold up decided that he could handle it no more. In an overreaction and obviously under great stress and difficulty, he cracked and burnt to the ground each and every building on that particular farming property.

It stands clearly well ahead of the One Nation statement. It provides a basis to generate jobs right across Australia and offers a real alternative to the economic catastrophe facing Australia under this Government. I turn to build on the remarks of the Deputy Leader of the Opposition on one aspect on the inflationary front. The briefing papers under attachment 5 of document 25 state:

         As the Deputy Leader of the Opposition so clearly indicated, that puts a lie to so much of the attack mounted by this Government since the November launch of the Fightback package. It puts a lie to the many other related arguments and confirms the progressiveness and fairness of the Fightback package compared with the Government's One Nation statement, which cuts out farmers, cuts out part time workers and cuts out a vast number of Australians from any income tax cut in terms of what is proposed in the One Nation statement. In any event, it is another 28 months before we would come to any changes in the tax base and in all that time the Government is collecting more revenue as it goes. Fightback stands up; One Nation fails. That fact will become clearer and clearer each month of this calendar year as people do battle to survive in the economic circumstances facing Australia.

         The other particular matter I want to dwell on is the excise tax on diesel, petrol and fuel and the road user charge debate. I notice that once we get to this section we get into a lot of the confidential blackouts relating to the document. However, I can fill in one of the blackouts because the honourable member for Wannon (Mr Hawker), I and others have very sharp memories for some of these details. It says on page 2 of document 31:

        The bit blacked out was in fact `15.6c a litre'. I am happy to fill in that lot. I challenge the Minister for Social Security (Dr Blewett), who is at the table, to fill us in on the four, five, six or seven other pages blacked out in the document and justify what they had to hide. Was it a section proving the case for Fightback? Was it uncomfortable for the Government to come in and table this particular aspect? Why did members of the Government have to take to the big black texta colour? Here is a bit of advice for those opposite: I know the FOI requirements are such that one does have to go through this agonising process, but if one is going to black it out, one should do it properly; otherwise one will get exposed for what one is doing.

         The serious dimension in respect of this debate on fuel excise needs to be made very clear cut once and for all. It is the absolute commitment of the Liberal and National parties to abolish all diesel fuel excise, all petrol fuel excise and, in fact, all avgas fuel excise taxes—no ifs, no buts. Indeed, in doing that, we are being responsible and taking it back to levels of taxation which existed when Hawke came to power. People have forgotten that under the eight years of the Hawke Government there was an increase in fuel excise taxes of 319 per cent with some 25 increases. Petrol and diesel fuel excise went from 7.155c a litre in July 1983 up to 25.7c a litre in February 1991. That is what is adding massively to the transport and freight costs, and that is what we are going to abolish. It is of no use this Minister at the table standing up and saying, `But you are going to bring in road user charges' because that argument which the Government brings forward is a nonsense. Even the former Prime Minister, the great leader to whom this Minister was attached and supported over that period, used that argument.

Does One Nation do anything about that? It does nothing at all. Does Fightback do something about that? Yes, it does. It abolishes the 20 per cent sales tax on freight services; it abolishes all diesel fuel excise, all petrol fuel excise and all avgas fuel excise. It introduces GST on fuel. But the net saving is 19c a litre. If that fuel is for business usage, it will be fully refunded.

Nothing in this documentation takes away, in absolute terms, from our commitment to abolish all fuel excise taxation and to look at what the State and Federal governments might come up with in terms of a road user charge system. That, in fact, will be revenue neutral in effectively replacing the existing hotchpotch of different taxes and charges which exist around the States. It is a firm commitment; it is one we stand by; and it is one which will actually benefit rail by many millions of dollars in direct terms.

         But do not any members of the Government for one moment think that there is no such thing as a consumption tax in Australia today. The truth of the matter is that the Government is about to make it even more complex than it has been. The Government has—John Edwards and many others have confirmed it—a sales tax of billions of dollars. It has a direct consumption tax on people at the rates of 10 per cent, 20 per cent and 30 per cent. The Government is about to add a new rate of 15 per cent sales tax for a narrow definition of vehicles. Not even the farm utility will get up for that 15 per cent sales tax.

         Before dealing with that theme, I would like to say a little about the honourable member for Flinders. We heard one of the most vacuous performances from him today that we have ever heard. First of all, he is the only politician that I have ever encountered who would claim that a program, on which he was the only politician and on which he was given a 15-minute interview, was biased. He claims that somehow that program was biased, even though no Labor person appeared and he had his 15 minutes to comment on the program. He came into this House and, reflecting the paranoia of his Leader, claimed that somehow the ABC was biased in treating him in that way.

First of all, he made the point—which I think even most members of the Opposition might recognise if they have had any experience in the House; though I must say that is probably not true of most of them here—that Treasury has always, under governments of all complexions, done so-called costings of packages and policies put together by oppositions of the day. He went on to warn the honourable member for Flinders:

        That is not a Labor person speaking. That is a man with great experience in the Treasury and who, of course, appeared for many years on the benches of the Party opposite. I suppose the best answer to the kind of criticism produced by the honourable member for Flinders is simply that in this document Treasury, because of its professional approach, pointed out that the Opposition had overestimated somewhat the inflation effect. Therefore, members of the Opposition are going to find it very difficult to run around the country saying, `This is a most improper political exercise. It minimises the impact of inflation resulting from the GST'. But they can try to sell that. They have a lot of difficulties, but that is one of the biggest.

         The honourable member for Flinders said, `Those most in need get the most out of Fightback'. If one looks at the Fightback proposals in the areas of social welfare, quite clearly the Opposition plan would replace the social justice programs of this Government with a pattern of social injustice. It undermines completely the obligations of government to help the poorer in this society and, as has happened in a number of other countries, would polarise this community because of its kind of emphasis on survival of the fittest. The Opposition is going to take $2 billion out of the social welfare budget and that will be used, as the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) pointed out today amongst other things, to pay for the biggest cuts for the better off.

We on this side agree that people would be better off working than being dependent on income support, and in all the policies that we have been pursuing in relation to unemployment and training there has been a strong emphasis on encouraging people to get back to work and to get into jobs.

No doubt most of these women will be moved onto unemployment and other benefits. They have been denied what the Opposition constantly argues about for other families—that is, responsibility to their children, particularly when aged 12, 13 and 14, which are critical early adolescent years. By contrast, we have set up the jobs, education and training program, which is designed to help women overcome these barriers to work by the provision of child-care and guidance back into the work force. That contrasts with the Opposition's program to help those most in need.

         Let us look again at this program to assist those most in need. The Opposition will cut off the Jobsearch allowance after nine months and push people out of social security. Some may get the special benefit—a lesser benefit—but nine months is the time period. Only those deemed to be in hardship will be eligible for special benefit. The others will disappear. If Opposition members bothered to read their own document, they would see that a group of them just vaporise—they disappear out of the system. Unemployed people, therefore, would no longer have that support. The way the Opposition has planned in this document to cut real training opportunities will devastate the training programs which are essential not just for now but so that as this economy recovers we do not find the kinds of blocks and jams that we have had in the past.

         I now turn to the distributional analysis, which was introduced this afternoon. I think it is beginning to sink in for Opposition members that, essentially, a GST is inherently regressive because the lower income earners pay a much higher proportion of their income in tax than the wealthy. As the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) pointed out, the Opposition, unlike a number of other countries, has refused to exempt food from the GST, while it has exempted travel packages for overseas trips. At some time the Opposition will have to explain to people why, unlike many countries overseas, it has not exempted food from the GST but somehow has exempted overseas travel packages.

         Opposition members will have to face up to the Treasury analysis—and neither of the two Opposition speakers today has tackled the essential revelations in that document—and explain in their own constituencies why this analysis shows that average losses in the bottom two deciles, the bottom parts of the full time wage and salary earners, are between $10 and $18 per week, whereas the average gain in the top decile, the top 10 per cent, is between $27 and $82 per week. The document that Treasury has presented, because it is a very objective document, points out that pensioners will, on average, get small gains, but many of them will lose because of higher than average expenditure on food, clothing and footwear. Some of those detailed analyses are particularly important because we need to look at the consumption packages of particular individuals as well as the more general averages.

         Moreover, the analysis that we have accepted, because it is in the Opposition document, is that all retailers will automatically lower their prices by the cuts in wholesale tax. The evidence from many overseas countries that have introduced a GST and offset it with wholesale taxes is that the opportunities are taken to keep prices up. The Opposition has a degree of confidence that retailers will not take the opportunity to increase their profits and blame it on the GST. The Opposition is introducing changes, and we are accepting that retailers and wholesalers will not take advantage of the changes that are taking place, but it will be very difficult for people in the community to believe that that will not take place.

         We have not in our document—nor has the Opposition in its document—covered the flow-on effects of first level inflation. As the Treasurer pointed out, perhaps all that we have talked about is undermined completely by the fact that there is a massive hole—a $4 billion deficit. Opposition members talk to me about how they will compensate the poor and the pensioners, yet they cannot compensate them on the present package, because of that $4 billion deficit, which comes from the mistakes in the Opposition's revenue calculations and, more importantly, the mistakes on the expenditure.

When we go through each of those proposals the Opposition makes to save $2 billion, we find in the end that there is about $1 billion. That is because the Opposition has made three major mistakes in its calculations. I do not want to go into them all in detail.

         The Opposition admits to the administrative costs of its proposals. For example, to put people onto special benefits after nine months on JSA is an extraordinarily expensive operation. The Opposition has not allowed for the displacement effects anywhere near the level required. When people get jobs, they often take someone else's job and that person goes onto a social security payment. The Opposition almost entirely forgets the displacement effects. The Opposition assumes that when people have their benefit chopped off, they will vanish into thin air. The truth is that most people whose benefits are cut off often will move onto a lesser benefit and get less money. The Opposition has not allowed for that. As I said before, in the Opposition document some of the unemployed simply vaporised.

         The Parliament and the Australian people may well ask why whole pages of this Government document are blacked out. When we recognise the political direction to the Treasury, which my colleague the Deputy Leader of the Opposition uncovered, the truth will come out. The truth of this matter is that in Fightback there is a comprehensive, genuine, achievable program—put forward in plenty of time before the next election for genuine and constructive assessment and criticism—a genuine program to turn this country around, to restore high employment, with rising living standards, and to get the fearsome overseas debt under control.

We will begin to get it under control. When the people out there perceive this, let me say it will be honourable members opposite who will be the Gadarene swine and will share their fate on the next election night.

         There are many points in this debate. I take up first a brief reference to this so-called $4 billion hole. That battle about the so-called $4 billion hole was fought out and put to rest last December when that part of the Treasury calculation came out. What became clear was that there were points of difference between our estimates of the potential savings and the Government's estimates. In the Government's case its estimates were based incorrectly on different assumptions, or were just plain wrong. As the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Australian Financial Review

         We have a program in relation to Austrain, a program that people can go onto at the nine-month point, to which the Minister referred, at a 20 per cent lower training wage. We take the view that in the context of our policy there will be some confidence in the program and these people will take advantage of it and not just displace other people from jobs—which is what the Government assumes and therefore, it says, this does not effect any significant saving.

         In other respects we have the Treasury on our side in the Treasury document. It says that in particular the inflation rate will be 3.9 per cent, not the 4.4 per cent that we have said. I say to the people in the gallery and out there that they want to appreciate this. There are so many people running around saying that the GST is going to put 15 per cent onto everything in the shop right now. That is absolute rubbish. The reason is that we are abolishing many taxes, and among them are three whoppers: the wholesale sales tax, the payroll tax and the petrol products tax. They have both direct and indirect effect. When we think of the way in which fuel on the farm and between the farm gate and the supermarket shelf comes into the cost of a carton of milk, we can see that the price reducing effect of the abolition of those taxes is certainly much greater than the figures in this Treasury document. I will leave the old furphy about the one-off increase leading to sustained inflation to my colleague the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard), who will be speaking later in the debate. He will deal with that.

         One needs to appreciate the considerable array of changes that are proposed. If we take the Minister's speech, we see that the category which is most adversely affected, according to attachment 3, is $25,000 a year, about $500 a week. That is a typical average earner. Take an average earner on $25,000 with a wife and two dependent children. He is presently paying $4,694 in tax. He will get a tax cut of $1,185. There will be an extra $300 on the dependent spouse rebate. If there are two children, with the family allowance he will get an extra $1,040. So we get a total of $2,525 a year extra that this family will receive. The interest they receive on any new savings will no longer be subject to tax. They will get an additional $200 tax credit for family private health cover. When the child care decisions are finally in place they will have access to them. The wife can begin to contribute to a retiring savings account against the day when she goes back into the work force. The amount spent on consumption by that group after taxation must be of the order of $18,000 to $20,000, so there is an increase of $800 to $1,000 from the GST to set against that total of $2,525, plus all those other things I mentioned. So there is plenty left over for a cut beyond mere compensation that we have heard so much about.

It is about what is in store for our children and our grandchildren if we do not grasp the nettle now and take seriously the compelling necessity to implement a package such as the Fightback package. It revolves around serious and effective structural reform in all forms of transport, on the wharves, in communications, in electricity and elsewhere. It is not just building new railway lines, but reforming work practices and making them work effectively. It revolves around fundamental change in our labour relations so that there are workplace agreements for increased productivity.

The coalition's Fightback package is about real jobs, vision and hope for the future. It is built around carrying through fundamental structural and taxation change, in land and sea transport, on the wharves, in electricity pricing, in communications, and so on, and also carrying out labour market reform, and doing that both in public enterprises and in the private sector—indeed, in every corner of the nation. The Industry Commission, the Business Council of Australia and other authorities have objectively and independently estimated that if those changes are carried through, they will yield upwards of an extra $50 billion of national production over and above the performance we now have.

But the difference between the Fightback outcome and the scenario B outcome is that under Fightback we, Australia, will be able to service the foreign debt and thereby arrest its build-up, whereas under scenario B the debt goes on building, to make Australia the most vulnerable economy in the world, to the lasting detriment of our children and our grandchildren.

         There is no quick fix. The Fightback package is big, comprehensive and tough enough—it will not be easy to implement—to address the three issues of jobs for Australians, restoring rising living standards and containing the debt. I have no doubt that the Australian people will perceive that.

         —This House is conducting this debate today basically because an analysis of the Fightback package by Treasury and the Department of Finance have been made public by the decision of the Government. In various ways the Opposition has sought to denigrate the positions put forward by those two departments. Some of the material that has been dealt with has been produced in public before, and some of it has been produced here for the first time.

         Those opposite cannot get away from the fact that these are not, in a technical sense, political documents; they are documents from the bureaucracy. They do not contain what the Government would have to say about the Opposition's Fightback package. We would have, in ways in which the Treasury documents do not outline, serious philosophical differences from the approach that has been taken to the governing process by our opponents in the Fightback document which the coalition has produced. The departments simply go to their figures.

         Basically, those documents say that in terms of the fiscal responsibility of the document, there is a $4 billion gap between the Opposition's figuring and that of the two departments when they set themselves the task of analysing it. In fact, as a government, we would think the gap is much greater than that. But they are not our versions of events that we are presenting here in these documents; they are the versions of the two departments. It is the advice that would be received by any incoming Liberal government as to the impact of its package—no more and no less than that.

         In addition to the enormous shortfall in the Opposition's calculations, which, after the expenditure additions are taken into account, wipes out virtually all of the savings, the departments have come out with a distributional analysis, essential in the case of the Opposition's package, but not in the case of the One Nation package which we brought down last week. They are two different documents. One Nation is about the measures dealing with a recession to improve the employment prospects of the population. It is not about a distribution of taxation arrangements. The Fightback package is about distribution, hence there is a distribution analysis.

         The Opposition has come up with a strategy to deal with this enormous problem. The strategy is that those opposite will provide a tax package, associated with the introduction of a goods and services tax, which will guarantee a substantial return for the high income section of the population, but for 70 per cent of the population, on its introduction, there will be a substantial reduction in the resources that are available to them.

        the Deputy Leader of the Liberal Party, the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith), when he made his peroration on this subject and leaned across the table and said `Gotcha' in his assessment of the Treasury documents, was convinced that there was some indication that the Government had interfered with the departments.

         This is what the Treasury changed following a request from the Treasurer's office. Essentially there are three alterations in the Department's documents. The first is by way of a summary. There is a set of figures from the Liberal and National parties in the Fightback document and sets of figures by Treasury and the Department of Finance as to what those figures meant. The Treasurer's office sent back to Treasury and asked it to produce a third table showing the difference between the two. That was the result of the intervention of the Treasurer's office: `Kindly subtract one from the other so that a third table is created which shows the difference between the two'. Some massive interference with Treasury calculations!

         In one other table a set of assessments was put forward on the question of savings related to superannuation funds. The Treasury had based its calculations on one set of views and the Opposition had its calculation based on another. The Treasury produced its calculations without using the Opposition's bases and the Treasurer's office said, `Be consistent. Use the basis that you have used throughout your analysis of the Opposition's document. Don't start a different process of assessing for that particular item'. So it did not. It took it back to what it had been before.

         The third element was yet again another of those exercises of, effectively, asking Treasury to balance the table to establish the difference between the Opposition position and that of Treasury and Finance—instead of using the two tables juxtaposed side by side—for the convenience of those who were to look at it. Of course, none of these things altered the analysis of the Treasury in any way at all. Treasury's analysis of the Opposition package has been devastating. A proper reading of the figures points not only to the fact that this package would be devastating for the average taxpayer in this country, but also to the fact that it would be devastating for the economy.

         One of the things we have seen from the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) over the last week has been a particular surprise for those of us who thought that he would hold his document a bit longer than he has managed to do. Those of us who thought that have been surprised at the speed at which he has back-pedalled from that wonderful statement in scenario C which featured so prominently at the time he presented the Opposition's Fightback package. At that time he said, `Okay, you do all these sorts of things: you have this redistribution of the taxation system from taxes on income to the indirect tax base and you do a few other things besides and you get scenario C'. There was no hedging of this; there was no saying that this was a matter subject to review or that it was being worked towards or that it might be achieved. It was plain and simple, straight up and down: there will be two million jobs.

         That position which was put then has been repeated subsequently in correspondence from the Leader of the Opposition to the Australian people.

         The Opposition might have that view, but one can form another interpretation of scenario C if one decides to look at the inflation figures under that scenario. One can see that it was not modelled on the GST package. One has to add what is calculated by the Opposition—or, as I will go on to say, what Treasury and Finance see as the likely inflation outcome—to the inflation assessment in scenario C. What one comes up with in the year in which this Fightback package would be introduced is an inflation rate of some 12 to 13 per cent. If one adds the Treasury assessment of the Opposition's package—which is a very modest assessment on the likely inflationary impact of it—to that, one will have not just double digit inflation but double digit plus some.

         There is one certainty left in this package, and I will get back to that a bit later.

Of course, we'll have to look at them anew in light of changing circumstances'. One does not blame him. He has a $4 billion hole; obviously he has to have a look at those taxation arrangements again if he is going to go around belabouring us for putting forward so-called unfunded propositions.

It would have a devastating impact on the young people and their anticipation of their chances in life if he were to walk back from that.

         So what is he left with? In this entire package he has one certainty. The only thing in this entire package that the public can rely on with absolute certainty—all else is problematic—is that the Leader of the Opposition will impose a 15 per cent consumption tax on the broadest range of goods and services of any consumption tax in the world. That is the certainty; the people know that. They know that the prices of their essentials of life will rise very substantially. They know there is no likelihood of any compensatory outcome. They will not get it; but even if they did, they would not hold it when subsequent attention was paid to increasing the rates of that consumption tax.

         The contrast with the approach taken by the coalition in Fightback could not be more stark. We did not build a model especially to give us desired or contrived results. We ran our package through an existing model used not just by the coalition, but by no less an authority than the Treasury itself. The results of this exercise are well known, as are the results generated by running the Government's `One Nation, One Job' statement through the same model, which shows the Government's proposals to be a disaster for Australia. Having cooked the books on its own economic statement, the Government then turns around and, in an act of monumental hypocrisy, employs completely different growth and inflation assumptions in its assessment of Fightback than it has used in its own economic statement. It then uses these assumptions to generate the results it has always sought in relation to the Fightback package.

Even this Government has found limits to the extent to which it can distort and misrepresent the effects of the coalition's policy proposals. For example, we have the Treasury's favourable conclusion on the inflation rate, generated by the coalition's tax reform proposals. The Treasury analysis produces a one-off CPI impact nearly one per cent less than we came up with as a result of our own independent studies and modelling. This result on its own is enough to give the Government cause to hang its head in shame over its naked scare campaign over the price effect of the goods and services tax proposed by the Opposition.

He said that he is not going to give his policy statements and his pronouncements in this place with bird calls. He did that today. Did honourable members hear the bird calls today? The man cannot lie straight in bed.

         What the coalition proposes is there for all to see. In a minute dated 27 November last year Dr Preston, Deputy Secretary to the Treasury, advised the then Treasurer—and I forget which model that was; there have been as many Treasurers as there have been accords:

        The denial by Government Ministers of this all-important point is just more evidence of the duplicity of this discredited ALP Government and its senior Ministers. The truth is that, under the coalition's proposals for the abolition of payroll tax, excise on petrol and business inputs, exporters will be advantaged to the tune of $1.7 billion per annum. Our export competing industries will benefit from their share of the $20 billion-plus, and business will benefit under our program in a full year. Even the removal of the excise on petrol—26c a litre for business inputs—

         The Government sponsored Treasury analysis makes a number of claims about the effects of the tax cuts that the coalition has proposed in its Fightback package. These have yet to be fully analysed, but one thing is clear: the coalition has given an unequivocal commitment to the return of bracket creep under its Fightback package. It is right there on page 21 of the main
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">

       <para>
        It cannot be any clearer than that. I might say that this is in complete contrast to the alleged tax cuts in the `One Nation, One Job' statement, which contained absolutely no commitment to the return of bracket creep. Of course, this comes on top of the $22 billion in bracket creep that this Government has stolen from the taxpayers of Australia since 1983, and on which it has been sitting ever since.

         The alleged tax cuts in the `One Nation, One Job' economic statement have been examined in an article by Daryl Dixon in the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Sydney Morning Herald
         </emphasis>
         last Saturday which I would commend to all honourable members. Indeed, I would commend the headline of the article to all the back bench lefties opposite. It reads:

       <para>
        That is good old lefty language. They would understand that. In that article Daryl Dixon shows that each taxpayer would pay a minimum $4 a week in additional tax simply because of the decline in the real value of the tax free threshold. This would generate a revenue windfall for a Labor government of around $1.5 billion, with a similar windfall coming from the decline in the real value of the remaining tax brackets. So it is that the Government plans to add $3 billion in tax bracket creep over the next few years to the $22 billion it has ripped off the Australian people since 1983. Yet the Government has the unmitigated gall to come in here with its cooked Treasury analysis and lecture us on bracket creep.

        The Government opposes these amendments because they unnecessarily increase the membership of the board of the Institute, making it too cumbersome to efficiently manage the functions of the enhanced Australian Institute of Health and Welfare. The Institute is not a large body. It needs as small a board as possible to manage its activities.

         The amendments would result in four specific organisations being given positions on the board. This may well lead to the nominees of those organisations being constrained by the limits of any sectional interests or of the interests of their particular body. These may not necessarily be in the interests of the Institute's broad functions. These arrangements would not be sufficiently flexible, in that only the particular nominees of the specified bodies would sit on the board. They make no provision at all for the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services to consider recommendations from other organisations. There is also the possibility, of course, that a named organisation will cease to exist or change its focus so that its representation on the board would be no longer appropriate.

         —The Government is completely wrong in relation to these amendments to the Australian Institute of Health Amendment Bill 1991. It is wrong on everything lately, but it is even wrong on a simple thing like the Australian Institute of Health. We have put on the record our support for the Institute. Worldwide there are other examples of how effective a good institute of health can be. The best one is probably the American example, even though the actual structure and aims are slightly different. We believe we do need a good, independent AIH. The trouble is that the AIH board we have at present is not independent; it is very much a political appointment.

         We have great sympathy for having a smaller board—there is no problem with that—but, if we are going to have a smaller board, let us have a smaller board that is balanced. What we have at present is a smaller board which is unbalanced. It is absolutely stuffed full of political appointments, many of whom are former Labor Party staffers. Bettina Cass is on there, who replaced Liz Furler, who was an assistant secretary under the present Minister for Social Security (Dr Blewett). The associations with the Labor Party go back a long way. These people may well be competent, but there is certainly a perception that they are not politically neutral.

         The clauses that we are considering at present have changed the details of the Senate amendments but not the main aim. The main aim was to ensure that there was representation from a number of bodies and these relate to some of the first parts of those bodies. We have no real problem with the way in which the Government has changed this. We preferred the original option of specifying where the nominees should come from, but we are not unhappy to accept the change in the wording which the Government is going to put forward, that is, that the specific groups should not be nominated. Groups which would be represented, for example, by the Consumer Health Forum representing the needs of consumers, ACOSS, the pensioner groups, Catholic welfare groups or the Brotherhood of St Laurence meeting the needs of consumers, are an issue with which we really do not have a problem. It is a question of which way it is addressed.

         We will come to the problem we have in the next part of the amendments which were passed down from the Senate relating to making sure that not just one side of the political spectrum is represented, not just one side in terms of the spectrum of social and other groups, but rather people with expertise are represented on this body. The other groups here are consumers of health services, consumers of housing assistance services with expertise in public health issues and knowledge of consumers of welfare services.

         We believe there is a good case for representing most of those groups, if not all of them, but even though the Consumer Health Forum has not been named, that really is going to be the group in the first clause. In clause (fa), welfare services, there may well be a choice between ACOSS, pensioner groups, Catholic welfare groups or the Brotherhood of St Laurence, which are amongst the ones named in the Government's indications. The needs of consumers of housing assistance services are referred to—that is presumably National Shelter; expertise in public health issues is provided by the Public Health Association. It is unlikely that any other groups would displace those. Whether they are named specifically or whether they are named in principle, we have no particular problem with that. We preferred the original option. It may be that there is a slight advantage for that option, but the advantage is not enormous, so we will acquiesce in the Government's proposals in regard to these clauses.

        The Government opposes these amendments for the same reasons as it opposed the first five, but there is an additional reason for opposing these. They would result in the board becoming quite unbalanced by providing for representatives of two health professional bodies—the Australian Medical Association and either the Australian Hospital Association or the Australian Private Hospitals Association. There is no rationale for these additional positions. The whole purpose of this amendment Bill is to enhance the Institute's functions into the welfare services and housing assistance statistical areas. It is in those areas that the Institute's board should be expanded to ensure that the needs and views of consumers of housing and welfare services are properly considered.

         —That shows a complete lack of understanding of the need for the board of the Institute of Health to be balanced. What the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services is basically saying is that doctors, who are in control of the consumption of some $4 billion worth of Commonwealth funds and people with expertise in hospitals who also have something like $4 billion worth of Commonwealth expenditure placed upon them—and somewhat more than that in terms of State Government expenditure—should be ignored.

         The fact is that doctors by and large go through six or seven years of basic training, plus another three or four years of subsequent training, are involved in a whole range of issues, including statistical analyses—certainly much more statistical analysis than most members, for example, of the Consumer Health Forum, who may well have a representative view to put but certainly would not be considered to be trained as comprehensively as the medical profession, are engaged in. The Parliamentary Secretary is saying that whether it is the AMA or the medical profession, whichever way it is looked at, it should not have a place on the board of the AIH. I must point out that that is not what the previous Minister, Dr Blewett, actually said. When he was forming an interim board he said that the AMA should be represented. Then he changed his mind, and appointed political hacks to do some of the work. I have mentioned some of these previously. There are some people in there who I consider would be political appointments.

However, I do not think it can be said that Dick Scotton is by any means politically neutral. He was one of the architects of Medicare and when he is added to some of the other people—I mentioned Liz Furler earlier; I did not mention Gay Davidson—these are people who would be clearly seen to be on one side of the political spectrum. It is very important that we have not only people who are politically neutral but people who represent the main areas of health. We are talking about the Institute of Health.

         At the bottom of the Government's list of potential groups there appears the AMA and the hospital groups as a sort of gesture. The truth is, of course, that we are looking at 10 groups vying for four positions. It is very interesting to speculate where the AMA or the hospital groups, for example, are going to fit in. One of the requirements is that they have knowledge of consumer health services. Sure, doctors do, but that would be interpreted as being for the Consumer Health Forum or any other group which might replace it in the future.

         What about the second group, `Knowledge of the needs of consumers' welfare services'? Doctors do a lot of welfare work, so do some of the hospitals, but I do not think they would be considered to be mainline in that area. `Knowledge of the needs of consumers of housing assistance services' is obviously irrelevant, so the only possible clause into which AMNIA and hospital representatives might fit is in `Research into Public Health Issues'. Clearly they would be competing with the Public Health Association and, in terms of public health, the Public Health Association is obviously paramount.

         That could be fixed up in a number of ways: first, by leaving the Senate amendments as they are—which is what we will be supporting and to disagree with the Government's disagreement of the Senate's changes—or, alternatively, it is possible to nominate further groups which would fall under clauses (fd) and (fe), which would require people with expertise in medicine and hospitals. Those are options which we will reserve to introduce in the Senate.

         For the time being we will say that we believe it is important that doctors are formally represented on the AHA board and that we believe it is important that hospital expertise is represented on that group, partly because of the expertise they bring and partly also because of their importance. If the Government is trying to collect data on health issues and wants the doctors to be on side and wants to be able to use their expertise, to exclude them from the board is basically nuts. The Opposition will disagree with the Government's disagreement at the appropriate time.

        The Government moves these amendments in the place of Senate amendments Nos 1 to 7 because its amendments keep the size of the board of the Australian Institute of Health to a minimum but are consistent with the need to ensure a proper consumer focus on the Institute's existing health functions and on its extended functions into welfare and housing statistics. The amendments also provide for all the organisations specified in the Senate amendments as well as three others to be included in a schedule. All these organisations will be able to recommend suitable people to the Minister. This is a much more flexible arrangement than having specific organisations on the board and would reduce any constraints that nominees might feel to represent the sectional interests of their own organisations.

         By including an additional three organisations in the schedule, the Government's amendments go further than the Senate's in addressing the Senate's intention of assuring that the Institute's board includes people able to represent the interests of consumers of services and people who are experts in the relevant field. Under these amendments, instead of six or seven specific bodies being on the board as the Senate provided for, the Minister will make four nominations: three from candidates with knowledge of the needs of consumers in the health, welfare and housing assistance areas; and one with expertise in research on public health issues.

         Amendment No. 1 provides for the Minister to nominate people within the above four categories. These will be in addition to the three ministerial nominees already included in the Institute's legislation. This amendment allows recommendations to be made to the Minister by organisations which represent the interests of consumers of health and welfare services or have expertise in public health research and are specified in the schedule. The schedule specifies 10 such organisations. The list comprises the seven bodies as named in the Senate amendments, plus the Brotherhood of St Laurence, the Catholic Social Welfare Commission and the Australian Pensioners and Superannuants Federation.

Amendment No. 4 provides for the four people to be appointed by the Governor-General for not more than three years.

         The remaining four amendments are essentially technical and are related to the insertion of a new schedule to the principal Act. I consider that these amendments give the potential for a broader range of consumer representation on the Institute's board and in a more flexible manner than is the case currently. The Minister may receive nominations from more than one organisation for a particular board membership position. In this way, we are designing an Act which is more flexible and sustainable into the future, as it does not restrict the possibility of alternative points of view coming onto the board.

         There is an important difference between the concept of a nominee of a particular organisation and the appointment of a person with particular skills and expertise. The amendments mean that while an organisation might suggest names, the Minister actually nominates a particular person. Such a nominee would therefore not necessarily be bound by the scope of a particular organisation. As I said earlier, this will help to ensure that the board is not constrained by the limits of any sectional interests. I commend these amendments to the Committee. I present the supplementary explanatory memorandum.

         —There is a great deal of overlap between this schedule and some of the points which have been discussed in relation to the earlier amendments. One can argue both for and against specifying exactly who will be on the board in terms of what organisation they represent, but those arguments get nowhere at all. The flexibility may be greater by not specifying in detail, but, of course, the control is still with the Minister. These are potentially political appointments. There is still the yawning chasm with having no medical appointment, no medical representation and no hospital representation specified.

         For a body like the Australian Institute of Health, which is referring to the health portfolio where in Commonwealth terms about $8 billion is spent in those two areas alone, it is an absolute nonsense not to have people with expertise specified as part of the group there. I have made that point before. It is a very important point. One has a very biased view in terms of what this board is made up of, but on top of this, one now has a total of seven effective ministerial appointments: the three original ones plus these four.

         I have already foreshadowed that we will look very closely at these amendments in the Senate and introduce a way of making sure that representation is made from the hospital groups and from the medical groups—be they AMA, APHA, IHA or some other group which is not specified. I believe it is vital to the good running of the board to get adequate broad representation rather than having this narrow sectional interest.

         —Of course we agree with this; it is our amendment. It is just amazing to me that in Bill after Bill the Government still has this age restriction on people who can take their place on boards or who can be chairmen of boards. It is obviously something which is entirely inappropriate in this day and age. I have lost count of the number of Bills in which we have actually moved this amendment. We always get supported by the Australian Democrats, who for once see the light in this matter. It always goes through; it always comes back here; and it always gets fixed.

         —The Child Support Legislation Amendment Bill 1992 makes a number of changes to the operation of the existing child support scheme legislation. At least two of these changes are welcome, in that they introduce a greater degree of much needed flexibility into the operation of the child support scheme.

         The first of these changes concerns the private collection of maintenance. Under the current arrangements it is compulsory for pensioners to register for collection by the Child Support Agency the amount of child support that arises from an administrative assessment by the Registrar. The Bill provides that pensioners may choose to have the child support payments made to them privately and directly, although they retain the option to register the assessment for collection by the agency. If, however, a pensioner reports to the Child Support Agency that payments are not being made as required, this option will cease and the assessment will need to be registered with the agency and must remain registered until the liability has been paid in full.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The other particularly welcome provision concerns payments made outside Child Support Agency arrangements. Currently the Registrar may take into account payments made directly between the parties as against the liability to pay the Registrar. As the Minister for Higher Education and Employment Services and Minister Assisting the Treasurer (Mr Baldwin) noted in his second reading speech, this is a popular provision with people subject to child support assessments. The Bill increases the range of payments that can be taken into account by the Registrar in this context. Included will be payments to third parties from which the custodial parent and children derive benefit and which are agreeable to both parties.

         One of the most significant criticisms that has been made of the child support scheme and its administration by the Child Support Agency is its tendency to come between, or interfere with, mutually satisfactory agreements for child support worked out with each parent in private. The child support scheme must retain as much flexibility as is administratively possible if it is to take into proper account such mutually beneficial arrangements; otherwise the scheme risks becoming more of a hindrance than a help to the children it is designed to benefit.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         One of the many problems that have been encountered in the operation of the child support scheme is that whereas non-custodial parents may have previously been happy to contribute over and above the minimum required level of maintenance payments, interference by the Child Support Agency in such voluntary arrangements can result in a great deal of reluctance to contribute anything more than the bare minimum required by the agency's maintenance formula. That not only involves the non-custodial parents taking advantage of the letter of the law; it is often the result of resentment felt by one or both of the parties towards the interference of the agency in these matters, which has sometimes degenerated into outright harassment of both parents by the agency.

         Other provisions of the Bill introduce a new administrative review process to be made available to all persons named in a child support assessment who might want to depart from an assessment made by the Registrar. The new review process will be conducted free of charge by an independent person. The review process includes provision for agreement to be made between the parties on how child support payments should be paid.

         Under the proposed legislation the Registrar is also to receive increased powers of garnishee in the case of a person holding money on behalf of a payer who has outstanding child support debts. The recovery of such overdue amounts is by way of notice in writing to the person holding money on behalf of the person with the outstanding child support debt. These provisions will allow the Registrar to garnishee funds administratively without the benefit of a court order. The agency will thus be able to act quickly to recover debts when it identifies the possibility of recouping funds that might otherwise escape the agency's net.

         Perhaps the principal difficulty with the existing child support legislation is the formula currently being used to calculate the liability of the payer. It should be stressed that this causes difficulties for both parties to a child support assessment. The formula does not take into full account the payer's, or non-custodial parent's, financial circumstances, such that an assessment for child support can place them in real financial difficulty. This stems in part from the adoption of taxable income as the main criterion for assessment, as opposed to disposable or after-tax income, which is a more accurate reflection of funds actually available to the payer for the purposes of child support.

         The formula can also ignore the fact that the custodial parent may be in a relatively good financial position and not be in need of such high levels of child support as would result from the direct application of the formula to the payer without regard to the circumstances of the payee. At the same time, there are inevitable technical difficulties involved in calculating the non-custodial parent's income. The scope for income minimisation on the part of self-employed non-custodial parents, and those working outside the PAYE system, is obviously considerable and can result in unsatisfactory remittances to the custodial parent. When new relationships are entered into, particularly those involving additional children, serious equity difficulties arise in the treatment of all the children concerned.

         Clearly, the maintenance formula used by the Child Support Agency is a source of considerable difficulty and should be reviewed to make it more sensitive to individual cases. Despite occasional legislative changes to the child support legislation, such as in this Bill, the administration of the child support scheme by the Child Support Agency in the Australian Taxation Office is still far from satisfactory. It is difficult to attribute these difficulties directly to the provisions of the relevant legislation. Rather, these difficulties would appear to stem from the inherently intrusive nature of the child support scheme. Consequently, many of these problems will be unavoidable; nonetheless, we should make every effort to ensure that the scheme operates as smoothly and as fairly as possible.

         It is clear to me, however, from representations I have been required to make on behalf of constituents, that the Child Support Agency in the Australian Taxation Office in Perth is operating in a particularly unsatisfactory manner. There have been some outrageous delays between the making of a court order and the registration of a liability with the Child Support Agency, and between the lodgment of an application for maintenance to be collected by the agency and the receipt of the first maintenance payment by the custodial parent.

         The initial delay has been at least between eight and nine weeks. In some cases it has been much longer. This causes considerable difficulties, particularly for those who had previously been in receipt of regular maintenance payments under alternative voluntary arrangements. In part, these delays have been caused by the necessity of collecting these payments through the same system as applies for PAYE taxes. But this by no means accounts for all the difficulties that have been encountered. We are well past the time when these delays can be blamed on the backlog of cases with which the scheme began and other start-up difficulties which have been the main excuse of the Child Support Agency to date.

         Recently it was reported that the Child Support Agency in Perth had delivered a mass of confidential information to the wrong person. The agency had been conducting a national search for a maintenance defaulter, which naturally resulted in the accumulation by the agency of a large amount of information on this person for delivery to the payee. This information was then posted to the wrong person, who, thank goodness, was good enough to report the mistake to the agency so that the information could be and was returned.

         Had this person not been well motivated, however, the information could have been abused in all manner of ways. What is particularly disturbing about this case is that apparently this is the second such error by the Child Support Agency involving the same individual. On a previous occasion details that were meant to be sent to his estranged wife were sent to him, and details meant for him were sent to his estranged wife. Such administrative errors, while seemingly inconsequent if taken in isolation—they might very well be just that, inconsequent—nevertheless represent serious breaches of privacy on the part of the agency.

Not only had my constituent's former husband been allowed to fall significantly behind in his maintenance payments which the agency failed to enforce, but also the agency took it upon itself not to collect any maintenance payments at all and remit them to my constituent on the basis of a court application that the father had supposedly made to have his maintenance payments reduced.

The payer in this case was granted a facility to defer all his maintenance payments, despite the fact that he would almost certainly have to pay at least the reduced amount that he was seeking, while the payee, as agent for the children, was to be given no such consideration.

         The non-custodial parent was being trusted to make payment for all his arrears, but the custodial parent was not trusted to make repayment for any overpayment as a result of any variation the court might order. Clearly this disadvantaged the children in this case whom the child support scheme is meant, above all else, to serve. What is more, it raised the question as to why the husband could not make continuing applications to the court in order to avoid having to make any payments at all, or why my constituent could not have lodged an application for an increase in the payments and thereby turn the tables on the payer and the agency completely.

The maintenance payments were simply not made.

         —The honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher), who has just resumed his seat, has launched a savage attack on the Child Support Agency. I believe that his attack is being misdirected when he targets the personnel and the general administration of the CSA, whether it be in Western Australia or anywhere else. I have had considerable contact with officers in my own State and I find that they are extremely hardworking. They are under great stress because they are dealing with very human problems. They have resource difficulties, which is typical of many people in departments who have to deal with daily problems and complaints. In order to enable people to have access to information, the Government has set up a toll free number across the nation. The officers are dealing with traumatic people, people who are living separated lives and families that are torn apart. Whilst I will concur with some of the concerns that the honourable member for Curtin has expressed, I believe that he is being too hard on the individuals associated with the Child Support Agency.

         I think we need to go back prior to 1987. Everyone who has had an interest in this issue of the separated family and the plight of children would be very much aware that no government prior to that time had the answer. It did not matter how much pressure came from the public, there was an argument that parents had a responsibility to care for their kids if they brought them into this world. There was really no answer until the Fogarty report from the consultative committee, headed by Justice Fogarty. It was from that study that this scheme was brought forward. It is a scheme that has a number of principles embodied in it. One principle is that we ought to require parents to be responsible for their kids if they bring them into the world. We ought to ensure that there is this principle that they contribute to the support of their children based on their financial ability to do so. That is very much the basis of the child support scheme. The objective is to ensure that the parents, particularly non-custodial parents, meet their fair share of the cost of supporting their kids. As the honourable member for Curtin has said, the child support scheme is administered by the Child Support Agency in the Taxation Office.

         Many people do not have to go to the Child Support Agency because they use that other avenue of coming to a private agreement and they sort it out themselves. As we all appreciate, that is not always possible, but it can be done. A person can have a private agreement and lodge it with the CSA as a child support agreement. But too often the agent has to come down on the non-custodial parent—not based on what the parents wanted, but on what the court decided. It needs to be understood that too often the CSA has no control over what the court has decided; it is bound to enforce those rules. This is often not understood by those who represent the broken family; it is not understood by the critics of the system in the community; and too often it is not understood by those who are affected themselves.

         The formula that has been worked out is open to criticism: a parent with one child pays 18 per cent of salary after some deductions. With five children, the payment grows to 36 per cent. It shifts up from 18 per cent, to 27 per cent, to 32 per cent, to 34 per cent and then to 36 per cent. Some would argue, `How can the Government require a parent to pay only an extra two per cent for an extra child?'. There may be some valid criticism there. If we look at the tables that are available, we realise that the large family really faces difficulties under the formula. Yet again it does seem to work. It allows for inflation and is calculated each year. But again there is a problem here because the rules that the CSA must work by are our rules in this Parliament. The inflationary measure is not based on the CPI; it is based on the Budget. The Budget forecast last time round was 7 per cent but, as most of us know, it is less than 2 per cent. Yet those who have had their child support payments recalculated are having it recalculated on a 7 per cent inflation rate.

         I repeat that it is not the CSA's fault. A reassessment is available if there is a major fall in income—at least I think it is a major fall—of 15 per cent. It has to be at least that or more. I constantly have custodial parents saying that they are not getting enough and non-custodial parents saying that they are paying too much because their salary has dropped—not by the necessary 15 per cent, but by some 10 per cent.

There are some measures that are designed to remove the real problems in terms of legal costs and court delays. As I said, people can get together, reach an agreement and lodge it with the CSA. But very often that does not occur. The real complaints come back to the Family Court itself, with the costs that people have to bear, delays in getting the settlements achieved and, finally, in having the CSA act upon those agreements.

A few years back in my electorate I had a case of a fellow earning $700 a week and generously—I say that with real anger—giving his wife $21 a week to support three kids. That was $1 a day. Disgusting! He thought he was hard done by when the rules came in which meant that he then had to increase this amount to 32 per cent of his salary because he had three kids.

I have another case of a fellow who is unable to see his children because his spouse has gone to Tasmania to be with her parents. There is no way he can afford to go down to see those kids, nor can he afford to bring about a variation of the order in the court. It means going to Tasmania to do so.

On the other side of the ledger, I have had a case of a wife who waited 11 months to receive any support. The honourable member for Curtin raised a similar example.

There are constant challenges to the agreement. Men tell us that they cannot get legal aid, but women can. There is anger out there; there is dispute; there is trauma. We really need to look at the system again, not to cast aside the fabric but to have a hard look as to how it is working. How do we address the problem where husbands will hide their assets?

One of the biggest troubles has been that people have to go to the courts to try to change things. This Government has seen the need for a different type of system, so we are setting up a special review officer system. The officers will be employed by the Registrar of the Child Support Agency and will carry out independent assessments of child support, free of charge, without legal costs, and the lawyers can be left out of it.

The liable parent—that is, the non-custodial parent—or, in fact, the custodial parent will be able to raise any of the issues which at the moment are grounds for appeal only before the courts. Circumstances which I briefly mentioned before, such as the high cost of travel for access and the special needs of children, will now be able to be raised. We often have a parent coming forward saying, `The child must have special dental treatment, but I cannot afford it and he will not pay for it. I cannot afford to go to the court to get a variation. What do I do?'. There is now a way. We will have a special review officer system.

Let us take the case of the wife in this instance. She is allowed to earn $29,931 a year, or $575 a week.

I have had case after case in which a non-custodial parent simply cannot afford to go to the court to solve the problem, and he just continues to pay into the CSA system.

         —Despite the introduction of the `no fault' divorce in the Family Law Act of 1975, the fact is that divorce remains a major battleground between men and women. The crunch of course is property, and this unhappily includes children who are often considered just that: property to be fought over and haggled about; pawns in an adult chess game to be moved about at will in a show of force against the other partner, rather than in the best interests of the children.

         One of the unlooked for consequences of the Family Law Act 1975 was the creation in this country of an unprecedented number of sole parent families. Since 1975, more than 700,000 children have been deprived of the care of one parent for some part of their lives. By the end of this decade that figure will have risen to over one million Australian children. It is estimated that 55 per cent of the divorces in 1990 involved one or more children—that means 45,000 children were involved in divorces in 1990 alone.

Social security payments in the same period—that is the period from 1973-74 to a decade later in 1985-86—rose from $160m to $1,757m and continued to rise to $2,334m; that is $2.3 billion in 1989-90.

That was the rationale behind the creation of the child support scheme which of course was introduced in two stages from July 1988.

If people write a letter it takes about three months to get an answer.

         For at least 30 per cent of non-custodial parents, the child support scheme simply does not work. These parents are not receiving any maintenance from former partners who claim to be unemployed or who have their own businesses. Many of these custodial parents have been waiting for years to receive maintenance from their ex-partners and are extremely critical of the agency's handling of their cases. At the heart of the problem often is the inflated claims which the agency makes for itself. One custodial parent said that when she first rang up to make inquiries she was treated pleasantly and told that the agency could virtually do anything. The attitude was, `No problems. We'll follow it up. We'll get the money for you. If need be, we can seize his house and assets and get your maintenance arrears for you'. But sadly the reality is very different.

In Melbourne this means that it has to hire court staff who are booked up for months ahead. It also has only two half-days allocated in the Family Court each month, which means that, under the present system, there will always be a tremendous backlog of cases to be dealt with. The other problem is cost. There is simply not enough money available to go to court to seize a non-custodial parent's assets, and then there is the problem of actually identifying what belongs to the maintenance defaulter or the non-payer.

         Historically, the situation under the Family Law Act had a distinct advantage in being able to routinely pressure errant ex-partners to pay for their ex-children—or should I say the children that they are not living with any longer. A man who was taken to court often had to pay at the courthouse or go to gaol. One woman told me that she was receiving intermittent maintenance from her ex-husband until the agency came into being. Every time he stopped paying for his children she would take him to court and he would pay because of the fear of going to gaol. Since the inception of the agency, she reports that he has not paid one penny for his children.

         According to studies carried out by the Institute of Family Studies, just three years after a marriage break-up a man, on average, has formed a new family—a wife and a child or children. Ten years after a marriage break-up few children from a previous marriage still see their natural fathers. A significant number of men appear to be so consumed with getting back at their former spouses that they refuse to accept responsibility for their children's maintenance. Indeed, this attitude was so widespread, as I have already noted, that prior to setting up the agency in 1988 the majority of men did not pay anything for their children by a previous marriage, throwing the onus of responsibility on to their former partners or the State which, in roughly half the cases, had to pick up the tab for their support. Most now have no choice about paying maintenance, as it is taken directly from their wages by the Tax Office as long as they are PAYE taxpayers.

Some men are creating multiple families, leaving them to create yet other new ones and arguing then in court that they cannot support the previous ones because of the new commitment. One man went on the dole while he went to court to argue that he could not pay the maintenance arrears because of unemployment, but as soon as the arrears were quashed by the court he was then able to go back to the job which was being held open for him.

         Women who are non-custodial parents often also appear to be acting as stereotypes of sexual behaviour. Believing that men are meant to keep women, they are loath to finance the children they have left behind, regarding them in the manner of a gift to their former partner. The result for very many custodial parents, particularly those with only part time jobs or who are reliant on the supporting parents benefit, is life on the poverty line. The children cannot understand why they cannot have new shoes when the old ones wear out and school outings can only be managed if the teachers happen to pass round the hat amongst themselves.

         The other side of this picture is that of non-custodial parents who are paying maintenance through the PAYE tax collection at source. There are numerous anomalies. The incomes of non-custodial parents, as the honourable member for Capricornia pointed out, have to drop to 85 per cent of what they were previously to receive any reduction in the maintenance that they are required to pay. If their income is only 85.6 or 85.7 per cent of what it previously was, then they do not qualify for reduction in the payments which are due to be made. In a period of recession, when people are having their work hours or their overtime reduced, this is not calculated to be just or fair. It is not simply a matter which one can pass off as not being the fault of the Child Support Agency; it is a matter which this Government ought to address.

         Likewise, the formula of prescribed payments is tied in with inflation. This means that a non-custodial parent's income is presumed to rise in tandem with inflation, which last year we know was much greater than it is this year. As maintenance is calculated on a percentage basis rather than at a flat rate, the harder non-custodial PAYE parents work, the more they will have docked from their pay, although there currently is a ceiling of $64,000 per annum. In one instance where a man's business expanded due to the efforts of his second wife, he found himself successfully taken to court by his first wife who was then seeking a second bite of the cherry in the share of his enlarged income.

In one example of the unrealistic and inflexible demands of the CSA formula, a dairy farmer and his second wife, who were getting only $200 a week in income from the farm, were ordered to pay out $120 a week maintenance to the farmer's three children from his previous marriage.

         The lesson for all of us is that people when they marry must be made to understand that marriage carries with it responsibilities and financial burdens. For example, when couples marry they at least ought to be aware of the legal consequences of marriage. These might include, for example, the equality of status of the sexes under Australian law, which means that women entering marriage do not become subject to male domination or exploitation; that assets brought into the marriage are joint unless held separate from that marriage; that contributions to the marriage include not only financial earnings through paid work but also the value of practical contributions through housework and related services, nurturing contributions through care, the socialisation of children and spouse support; and that under the Family Law Act both parents will be held equally responsible for continuing care and maintenance of dependent children of the marriage.

         Subsequent marriages would be entered into in full knowledge of ongoing obligations to first marriage children. Perhaps there ought to be a requirement under the Marriage Act that on second or subsequent marriages some disclosure be made of previous marriages and any obligations that are ongoing for the maintenance of children of marriages that have come to an end. This is apt to be forgotten, unfortunately, amidst the candlelight and romance of people's expectations of lifelong partnership. Despite all evidence to the contrary, young people seriously believe that their marriage will be forever.

         This Bill goes some way towards fixing the problem of defiance of the Child Support Agency by non-paying, self-employed, non-custodial parents. But the reality is, as has been pointed out by honourable members on both sides of this House, that the system remains so chaotic and inefficient that such piecemeal gestures will not suffice. A Liberal coalition government will oversee the reconstruction of the Child Support Agency from scratch.

He finished with a flourish by saying that a future Liberal government would rebuild the Child Support Agency from scratch. I am not quite sure what he means by that.

It was established by this Labor Government mainly at the suggestion of the Deputy Prime Minister, the honourable member for Batman (Mr Brian Howe), with the intention that the Australian Taxation Office should use its resources to ensure that non-custodial parents contribute to the upkeep of the children—

         —The shadow Minister claims that Attorney-General Durack suggested this when he was a Minister in the Fraser Government, but unfortunately those opposite never got around to doing anything about it. It required a Labor government in 1988 to bring the proposal before the Parliament. Before that time the majority of non-custodial parents did not contribute one cent to the upkeep of their children. It really was a long overdue measure and had the support of both sides of the House at that time. The result is that the majority of non-custodial parents are now making a contribution towards the upkeep of their children.

         Having acknowledged the great success of the Child Support Agency in ensuring that a majority of non-custodial parents contribute to the upkeep of their children, I do not think we can walk away from some of the serious problems that exist in the administration of the provision of child support. Tonight I wish to list a series of examples I have come across as the Federal Labor member for the electorate of Dobell, on the central coast of New South Wales. From conversations I have had with other members in this House, I think they are pretty typical of the difficulties the Child Support Agency has to address if we are to ensure that it provides a better service to the people it is established to look after.

         In the first case which came to the attention of my office the Child Support Agency had commenced to garnishee the wages of a person it believed was a non-custodial parent. It turned out that the person whose wages the agency was about to garnishee was not the non-custodial parent specified. In fact, the agency was going to garnishee the wages of the wrong person. I am sure that the Tax Office, the Child Support Agency, the CES, Social Security, BHP or any other organisation of this size in the private sector makes mistakes, but we can only hope that, when such mistakes do come to the notice of the Child Support Agency, systems and procedures are looked at to ensure that they do not occur a second time.

         In my opinion, one of the more serious difficulties we have with the operation of the Child Support Agency is that it does not try hard enough to use the powers it has been given by this Parliament—the powers of the Tax Office—to ensure that non-custodial parents pay their way. I am sure all members of this House, including the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hand), would be aware of particular cases where non-custodial parents, in spite of all the powers given to the Child Support Agency, are still seeking to evade their responsibilities.

In another case it was alleged that the non-custodial parent was able to obtain payment cash in hand while he worked in a band but at the same time was able to claim unemployment benefits because none of this income was declared to the Tax Office.

         Frankly, I think it is time the Child Support Agency more assiduously used the powers it has already been given. In particular, I think it is time the Tax Office had a look at the assets these people have accumulated. If it is necessary for the Tax Office to require those people to sell assets so that child maintenance arrears can be paid, I think that is a step that should be taken.

         Other cases that have come to my attention cause me to be concerned about the procedures that are followed by the Child Support Agency when the custodial parent provides information to the Child Support Agency on the activities of the non-custodial parent. I know this is a difficult area because there have been some cases where, given the difficulties and trauma often associated with the breakdown of a marriage, untrue allegations have been made by custodial parents. From examples I have been given I know that in a number of cases custodial parents have told the Child Support Agency the new address of the non-custodial parent, or have told the Child Support Agency where the person was working. After allowing several months for the Child Support Agency to take action to start recovering some of the maintenance from this person by garnisheeing his or her wages at the new place of employment, the custodial parent has contacted the Child Support Agency and discovered that the Child Support Agency has not recorded the information that my constituent had passed on several months previously. That causes me a great deal of concern.

         Mr Deputy Speaker, you would be aware that if someone is overpaid by the Department of Veterans' Affairs or the Department of Social Security and his only income is a pension, those departments will still deduct up to 10 or 15 per cent, I think it is, of the pension to recover those overpayments. As the Government thinks it is fair enough to take back up to that amount of people's pensions if the Government is owed a debt, I think it is fair enough for the people who are collecting money on behalf of the children to expect non-custodial parents who go on unemployment benefits to contribute up to that same proportion—10 or 15 per cent—of their unemployment benefits towards the upkeep of those children. It is probably more important that those children receive the money than the Government recovers a debt from someone overpaid owing to an error at the Department of Social Security or the Department of Veterans' Affairs.

         Other cases given to me demonstrate that the Child Support Agency does make mistakes. There are errors in calculating the payments which are owed to parents. There are, of course, other cases where the non-custodial parent comes to me and says that the Child Support Agency is deducting too much money. Of course, the Child Support Agency, as I have said before, given the number of cases it handles every month, can be expected to make mistakes, but the test should be how efficient it is in rectifying the problems and errors when they are brought to its attention.

         It is time that we tried to ensure that the Child Support Agency had a local representative in areas throughout Sydney and on the Central Coast.

I do not care whether that person is an existing employee of the Department of Social Security, who is nominated to be the local liaison or contact person at that office for all Child Support Agency problems. I do not care if that person is an employee, a person who is decentralised, if I can use that word—terminated—from the central office of the Agency and moved to the local regional office of the Department of Social Security. But whatever happens, it is time we had a person in the local offices of the Department of Social Security who is available for interviews and appointments with people who have problems, who have found that they have been unable to get answers to correspondence or have been unable to get clear answers to telephone inquiries.

         Some people say, `Well, that is what your local member is for. You ring your local member and complain, and the local member rings the parliamentary liaison person at the Child Support Agency'. I am sure all of us in this House do our best to help those people who contact us with difficulties. But for every constituent who contacts us with a problem, there are probably another 10 to 100 in our electorates who do not realise that we can provide that service and, despite the best efforts of the parliamentary liaison officers—and I give due credit to them; they have sorted out a lot of difficulties that I have brought to their attention—we cannot rely on that system to deal with these complaints. We need local representatives, either employees of the Department of Social Security or the Child Support Agency, who are there at those regional Department of Social Security offices. I think that is the way we need to go so that people can make appointments and have these problems sorted out.

         The beauty in having someone at the Department of Social Security office is that often there is an argument between the Australian Taxation Office and the Department of Social Security as to what has happened, especially where there are cases where a non-custodial parent refuses to pay any maintenance for a year and his tax rebate cheque is about to come through, and the Child Support Agency does it job and intercepts that tax rebate. That means that the custodial parent who has received nothing for the previous 12 months suddenly receives a large cheque which is to make up for arrears that have accumulated over a long time, and that subsequently results in an adjustment to that person's pension. Often there is confusion, and having someone at the Department of Social Security office able to deal with Child Support Agency and social security problems at the same time would provide a great improvement.

         While I am on that point—and this is really a matter for the Department of Social Security—I really do think it is unfair that it only averages that one payment that comes through after a non-custodial parent has not paid anything for 12 months. The Department of Social Security only averages that out over a three-month period. It does not take into account that that payment is for arrears that have accumulated over 12 months. If the Department of Social Security wanted to be fair, it would adjust that pension, taking into account that that is a payment that should be averaged over a 12-month period and not a three-month period. That is something which I hope the Minister for Social Security (Dr Blewett) can address.

I know that a number of constituents in my electorate are eagerly waiting to see what recommendations Mr Justice Fogarty makes on whether shift and overtime payments should be included in this formula, on whether other matters such as the income of the spouse of the custodial or the non-custodial parent should be taken into account and other matters.

         The last point I want to mention tonight is that I think something has to be done about the cost of seeking variations and fair payments under the Child Support Agency. I admit that the legislation we are discussing tonight goes one step towards seeking to reduce the legalistic nature of these matters. I continue to be disappointed by cases that come to my attention in which neither party is entitled to legal aid or, even worse, one party is entitled to legal aid and the other party, who might be on a modest income which disqualifies that party from legal aid, does not have an opportunity to have his or her case put fairly before the Family Court. As a result, I have come across cases in which I think such persons have been unfairly treated. They simply cannot afford the cost of legal representation that would result in their taking that matter back to court and getting a fair judgment. So I think that also has to be a major priority if we are looking at this area. How can we make the system less legalistic? How can we ensure that people can get a decision administratively rather than use lawyers? Perhaps we need to look at a system, such as the Department of Veterans' Affairs' system, in which it discourages the appearance of lawyers in that area.

My view is that that contact or liaison person should be at the Department of Social Security or somewhere in the local area.

Yes, the drug was lodged earlier in overseas countries but there are a couple of points to be made: the reason it was lodged earlier was because the companies had given up trying to lodge it in Australia because it was such a waste of time. It took so long because the bureaucracy required usually goes to 50 or 60 volumes of information.

         —Over 17 countries overseas have now approved this drug, which is a lifesaving drug. Referring to processing time the Minister said it took between 14 and 20 months, and he was proud it took that long. What does the Baume report say? It says around 200 days. I do not know how long 14 to 20 months is in terms of the Minister's days, but for most people there is a big discrepancy there. The Baume report says we should utilise those overseas evaluations and the Minister says, `Okay, we are not going to do that'.

         The Baume report also says that we should fast-track the whole process where it is a lifesaving drug. This is the most lifesaving drug one could wish to have. There is a letter asking for it to be fast-tracked and there is a response from the Minister's department saying, `Tough luck. Those patients can suffer and die but we will not fast-track the drug, even though it is safe and has been approved and people with those cancers are actually dying because they cannot get hold of the drug'. That is what the Minister's Department said—`Join the queue and wait'.

         The Minister referred to the special access scheme. Obviously the Minister does not know what is involved with the special access scheme; he is asking patients who are terminally ill, who are dying, to become importers of the drug—to go overseas, to arrange the importation, do all the Customs organisation, fill in the forms, get the drug over here, somehow find the money to pay for it and if they are still alive by the time it comes, they are lucky enough to receive it. The special access scheme is being misused; it is supposed to be used for drugs that are not available in Australia. There are stocks of this drug and many other drugs like it in Australia and it is inappropriate to use the special access scheme for that.

         That relates to other problem such as those with Benemid, where we export the drug from Australia to New Zealand so it can be reimported from New Zealand back into Australia under the special access scheme, or sending patients overseas to get Sumatriphan, a wonderful migraine drug that is available in New Zealand. Is it available here? Honourable members know the answer: it is not.

         The point is that the Baume report has not been implemented. There are intolerable delays. This drug, the name of which the Minister could not even remember and his department got wrong, as well will save lives. It is vitally important that we cut the red tape and the bureaucracy and make the drug available in Australia as soon as possible. We are talking about patients who have life-threatening diseases; they do not mind if the drug causes a few skin rashes or a few headaches. They would rather take that risk because at least they might be alive at the end of it to have the headaches. The way this Minister is handling it, they will not actually survive even to have the headaches.

         There is another issue which will come up in the very near future: what does one do when a drug is approved and the answer is, `Can you afford it?' The answer from this Minister almost certainly, as it has been with so many other drugs, is, `No, you cannot afford it; you have to pay for it out of your own pocket.' If one is rich, one is all right; if one has a house to mortgage, one is all right; if one has a car to sell, one is all right, but if one is a pensioner or in the lower end of the financial scale, it is tough. That is the same with the income taxes for this one broke nation policy that we had the other day. If one is at the lower end of the financial scale, one is just abandoned by this Government.

         The Minister also said that I actually approached the wrong Minister. He is probably not aware, but the Minister for Health, Housing and Community Services (Mr Howe) is the portfolio Minister and has overall responsibility. We all know that the two Ministers do not get on and have major disagreements about a whole range of things. At least the Minister for Health—who may be incompetent and ideologically bent—has some understanding, maybe a very basic understanding, and some pretence of caring. The Minister is coldly dismissing these patients. In many cases he is dismissing them to an early death and to a lot of suffering. It is intolerable. This drug should be made available at the earliest opportunity, with no red tape and with no restrictions so that people in Australia can get good health care again.

         —Bob Cousins and his wife, Pat, are decent people. In my view they are the salt of the earth. Bob had a very successful career in his chosen sport of motor cycle racing before settling down into country pubs, a number of which he ran for many years. He was very successful in Southern Cross before moving to Kalgoorlie.

         Bob, like a lot of publicans, was finding the going a bit tough in a town where there are a lot of pubs. He said to me one day, `It's pretty good, the bank has so much first mortgage security it doesn't mind if I am a bit late while I pay all the other creditors'. He had made a habit of being a little behind with the bank; in some cases, up to three months. Nothing was said by the bank.

         One day when he was six weeks behind someone from the bank walked into his pub and installed a mortgagee in possession. This was the Citibank. That seemed to be fine. The mortgagee in possession took charge of the pub and Bob was promptly hustled out. The mortgagee in possession, in a very short time, reduced the turnover from $10,000 a week to about $4,500 a week. Bob had been running this place with his family so his wages bill was negligible. The mortgagee in possession, of course, had a very high wages bill.

         My office made several attempts to negotiate a figure with Citibank to buy the premises back and bring the account up to date. In each case the bank was quite intransigent and, in my view, quite dishonest in its dealings. Now, some nine months later, the bank has sold the property after having offered it for auction when it was turned in at $400,000—a price the bank refused to accept. The bank had put a valuation on this pub when it lent Bob and Pat Cousins the money of $650,000. Bob owed the bank $205,000. One would have thought that there was plenty of security there, but nine months later the bank sold the pub for an undisclosed sum and told Bob that his debt to it is now $325,000.

         That is not just an increase in the amount he owes the bank, he also finds he owes it for all the unpaid bills that the mortgagee in possession ran up in the time that he had charge of the pub.

          The mortgagee in possession would have been paid and would have made sure that that payment came out of the very first income the pub got. Even the liquor licence and the liquor tax have not been paid. It leaves Bob in a very invidious position. It also threatens the $100,000 worth of unsecured creditors who had lent money on the basis of the very large equity that was in the pub. Their debt will be completely unrecognised.

         I have spoken to the appropriate Minister about this. One of the glaring deficiencies we have is that legal aid does not lend itself to help people in these predicaments. We cannot get legal aid to take on these big financial institutions. The financial institutions know this and their behaviour represents their arrogance. They simply say to their ex-clients, `Well, look, you sue us', knowing very well that the individual cannot possibly afford to sue the bank.

         If we are to restore some equity to the situation, it is about time that legal aid was funded and directed to allow challenges to some of these banks. It is quite clear that we would need to be successful with only a few challenges to bring these reprehensible banks to heel. Initiatives taken by the Government in the One Nation program are useful—I think long overdue—in changing the taxation legislation so that the banks do not have to pursue people into liquidation before they can write off a debt. It is a very useful thing. It is to be hoped that with this new tool at the banks' disposal we will have more responsibility, more humane action and more ethical action from banks than we have had in the past.

         In that quote the Treasurer refers to the people who are unemployed with that lovely word `the', as if they are a group. It is like the people who refer to `the wife'. They are referred to as `the unemployed' or `the disadvantaged', as if they are objects. That surely must be the way the Treasurer thinks of them—not as real live breathing people who have problems, but as ciphers he can use to beat the Opposition with: `the poor', `the unemployed'.

         It is quite interesting that the Treasurer should say that because he is the man who has considerable fame in this House for his methods of tax minimisation—is that the correct term?—or inventive accounting. Of course, this would not hurt the unemployed or the disadvantaged. They are the people who miss out when our Treasurer indulges in what we call inventive accounting—ways of minimising his tax.

One of those ways is to cast as many aspersions on the Opposition as it can, no matter whether they are appropriate or not. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) was called a racist, but that one did not wash. The Press did not even buy that one. We go back to that old favourite of the Labor Party: the Opposition does not care about the poor and the unemployed. I have got news for those opposite. The Opposition does care.

It is not just that we have a recession. If we go back to what this Government did before the recession, we had a country where the middle class and the lower class had suffered more in seven years under the former Treasurer than they had in the previous seven. If we look at the figures and at what happened to people on the lowest incomes compared with people on the highest incomes, the gap between the rich and the poor became greater. This is a government which governs by abuse and by deceit. I wonder whether all the members of the Government agree with this way of governing the country.

         We have all heard a great deal of discussion on the health system in America, in particular in the lead-up to the presidential election. Why? It is because the health system in America, the kind of system espoused by our friends in the Opposition, is one way in which one can ensure people can become poor. The cost of health insurance in America is astronomical. For those people who are in employment and who have their employer to pay, that may continue to be true. When one loses one's job or when one works in a place where the employer does not provide health insurance—indeed, 40 to 50 per cent of Americans work in such jobs—the cost of health treatment becomes absolutely outrageous. Professor Caplan found:

        Health insurance is not a national system. It depends on your personal ability to pay. You have to sell your house, spend all your savings, before you can claim any assistance.

It is the kind of program we see emulated by the people on the other side of the House. We all understand very clearly what it means at the end of nine months. These are the same people who will have spent all their savings and who will have been unemployed for nine months and what you say to them is, `There will be no income for you'.

As the Australians of the future, it is we, the younger generation, who will have to live with the consequences of today's actions, and therefore it is we who should play a large part in improving and protecting our environment. Our hands are largely tied, however, for we are too young to vote, too young to become politicians and legislate for change, too young to make any real difference. Despite this, there are some things we can do to improve the environment, and thus improve our own futures.

Recycling is another relatively easy answer. All organic matter around the home could be combined in a compost heap to provide a soil-enriching mulch, while local councils, as well as private companies, already provide services for the recycling of glass, paper and aluminium. These changes could very easily lead to a reduction in the rubbish building up in our tips, unsightly landmarks that also pour out large amounts of Greenhouse gasses. Other simple adjustments, such as ensuring taps and cisterns are not leaking, replacing chemical cleaning agents or insecticides with natural products and avoiding ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons may seem inconvenient at first, but when one considers the inconvenience that may result from wide scale pollution, these changes are actually very minimal.

         Students can also assist the improvement and protection of the environment in the wider community. When shopping we can take our own string or material bags, or `pre-loved' plastic bags, to reduce the numbers of these pollutants piling up. Another simple way to increase energy efficiency is to utilize Perth's public transport system. At the moment, "Perth is needlessly choking itself to death" (The

With the forthcoming completion of the Northern Suburbs Rail System, it will be even easier for everybody, including school students visiting the city, to avoid the use of cars and their smog-producing exhaust systems. There is, of course, an even cheaper, healthier and more environmentally friendly mode of transport—the pushbike. The humble bicycle produces no Greenhouse gasses, no poisonous emissions, and no smog, and it is a pleasant and efficient method of travelling. With a little encouragement and a few more cycleways, the bicycle could largely replace the family car as the main transportation for many young people, and if it did, could reduce the choking fog sometimes seen over Perth to a bad memory.

         "People power" is one of the concepts currently being advocated all over the world, and it could very easily be applied to students and their improvement and protection of the environment. Several schools all over Western Australia have initiated environmental programmes and they are making a noticeable difference. With their "Operation Dig In", Gingin District High School planted over 600 trees along the verge of Cockram Road near the school, not only improving the aesthetic quality of the area, but also counteracting at least some of the effects of the massive deforestation occurring all over the world. Roleystone District High School, on the other hand, recognized the problem of jarrah dieback around their school and attempted to remedy it by bulldozing the dead and dying trees, replanting the area with dieback resistant flora and fixing the drainage problem that was exacerbating the dieback dilemma.

Student groups can also petition the government or private companies about matters of their concern or fundraise for international environmental programmes, and these endeavours often result in changes for the better.

         —Last Thursday I had the opportunity, in a truncated period during the grievance debate, to refer to some concerns of constituents that had been raised with me dealing with the effects of the GST on sporting clubs. During that discussion I referred to the imposition of the GST that the Opposition's tax manifesto would impose upon them—things such as club membership fees, children's sporting clothes, their equipment, tuition and coaching fees, lessons that are conducted on weekends and afternoons, referees' fees and even player accident insurance. Even sponsorships provided to clubs from various organisations, free equipment and contra sponsorships are subject to the GST.

         Unfortunately, time did not permit me to deal with another aspect of the impact of the GST on sporting clubs which is equally important for the sporting activities of our young Australians—that is, the impact which the paperwork will impose upon the many honorary officials who administer those clubs. The experience in New Zealand, not surprisingly, is that the honorary officials—in the main, the mums and dads who give of their time freely—have been deterred from taking up those responsibilities because of the additional paperwork and the onerous duties which the GST has imposed upon them.

         —That is a nonsense, and the honourable member knows it is a nonsense. Sales tax does not apply to the operations of sporting clubs. They do not have to worry about the bookkeeping whatsoever. The wholesalers from whom they purchase the equipment conduct all that work. It is not a burden on the office bearers at all. Having spent some time as an honorary official of a number of sporting clubs, I know that to be the case. If the honourable member had been involved in his local sporting clubs, he would too.

        The keeping of GST records, filing claims et cetera places more burden on officials such as treasurers and auditors. Many sports bodies report to us that it is more difficult to attract and keep volunteer treasurers since the introduction of the GST. We have witnessed a gradual decline in people affiliating to sports clubs and in the numbers volunteering as officials.

        That experience in New Zealand would no doubt be replicated here in Australia had the Opposition the opportunity to introduce its GST package. The impact that that would have upon the sporting clubs around our country in each and every electorate would be to reduce the opportunity for young Australians—young boys and girls—to participate fully in sport and to gain not just the skills but the social and health benefits they derive from that activity.

        That is precisely what the GST is about. It is about taking money from those who currently are not in a position to provide it and reimbursing at a greater rate those who already are in a position of privilege in our community. It is not just the money; it is not just the effects on honorary officials, as I have described. Its total effect on our society is not just economic. It does affect the way in which Australians relate to one another; it does affect the Australian way of life. And it is a policy which in the end will bring the Opposition undone. The people of Australia will reject it. As the weeks unfold in 1992 those opposite will come to understand that more and more.

         —In the last few seconds I wish to pose a question to the honourable member who last spoke, the honourable member for Brisbane (Mr Bevis)—that is: how many community groups in his electorate have applied for sales tax exemption and been knocked back? Perhaps he would like to answer that question next time he participates in the adjournment debate. I can tell him that in my electorate countless community groups have tried to apply for sales tax exemption and are invariably knocked back. That furphy about sales tax is just that—a furphy. If he goes back to his electorate and makes inquiries of the large number of community groups that undoubtedly are in his electorate, he will find the same situation. Many of them would love to enjoy the benefits of sales tax exemption but are unable to do so.

The Commissioner determines whether the company, its expenditures and financial structures are eligible. The Board determines whether R&amp;D activities being claimed are eligible.

As a service to taxpayers and to enable them to understand and satisfy their taxation obligations the Commissioner has a program of public rulings which outline and explain how he interprets and applies the taxation laws. These rulings are not decisions and do not have the force of law. Decisions which affect individual taxpayers are made on the merits of each case having regard to any relevant ruling.

        On 9 May 1991 the Commissioner, as part of the ongoing rulings program, issued Taxation Ruling Number IT 2635. This Ruling follows rulings on research and development issued in 1987 and 1989 and deals with syndicated research and development arrangements with particular reference to sections 73B, 73C, 73CA and 73D and Part IVA of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936.

        It is the responsibility of the Commissioner of Taxation to examine the financial structures of syndicate proposals. Syndicated R&amp;D arrangements can take many forms, and proposals have been brought forward that involve financial investors seeking guaranteed returns using a variety of structural models. In response to this growing number of complex syndicate models the National Office of the Australian Taxation Office became involved in providing private rulings on individual proposals.

The changes were introduced in response to a number of proposals for syndicated R&amp;D ventures which had been put forward that attempted to remove all or most of the commercial risk to investors. This was achieved by guaranteeing a minimum rate of return to investors to be met from moneys claimed for the tax concession. A major component of the guarantee was to be obtained from payments for core technology. To remove this unintended benefit the legislation was amended to:

Nevertheless, I would like to assure the honourable member that contrary to the implication in some advertising that Australian cars have poor emissions performance in comparison to certain European models, recent tests have indicated that Australian cars are on a par with world emissions standards. Vehicle emissions tests conducted on a wide range of vehicles by the Victorian Environment Protection Agency showed, for example, that most new vehicles sold in Australia, whether imported or locally produced, meet the Australian emissions standards by a wide margin. This is because both Australian manufacturers and importers are using internationally accepted catalyst technology.
