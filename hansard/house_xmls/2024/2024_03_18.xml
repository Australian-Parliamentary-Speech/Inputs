              <span class="HPS-Small">The NDIS was intended to provide support for people based on their individual support needs, not their diagnosis. Complex cases of ADHD meet the criteria in the NDIS Act, but the fact that ADHD is not included in the NDIA's lists of conditions for eligibility undermines the goals of the NDIS Act. ADHD does not affect people in the same way. Similar to Autism, there are different levels of functional impairment that affect the everyday challenges a person living with ADHD experiences. ADHD is a lifelong condition; where a person clearly meets the NDIS criteria, they should be able to access reasonable and necessary supports under the NDIS.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">We urgently petition the Australian Parliament to address the prolonged processing delays in the BIIP, particularly in the Provisional stage. According to FOI Request FA 22/11/00681, more than 20,000 provisional business visas subclass 188 have been awaiting to be processed as at 30/06/2022. Additionally, The Migration Review Strategy 2023 confirmed the Government will not provide any new allocations for the provisional BIIP visa, which means no 188 applications could be processed in FY 2023-24. The visa applicants would be enduring a minimum of 36-month wait by 30/06/2024 with no end in sight. There are visa applications lodged around 05/2021 but still have not been finalised yet, whilst at the time of their application, the indicative processing time was around 12-20 months. This uncertainty has a profound impact on applicants and influences the future trajectory of their families and children.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We therefore ask the House to urge the Government to review the processing time for the BIIP and allocate substantial quotas for the 2024-25 FY, to expedite the resolution to clear the backlog of BIIP Provisional visa subclass 188 applications. By doing so, the Government will extend a fair and reasonable response to those investors who have been patiently awaiting processing. They are eager to come to Australia and committed to embarking on long-planned business ventures. Facilitating their timely entry will not only alleviate the backlog but also empower them to contribute meaningfully to Australia's economic landscape, thereby fostering the nation's prosperity.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The fate of our planet is at a critical juncture, highlighted by the IPCC's final Synthesis Report and the "Global Crisis. There is a Way Out" forum. Current trends project a catastrophic global warming of over 1.5 degrees Celsius, signalling irreversible damage to vital environmental systems. Concurrently, an international group of volunteers, including scientists, has forewarned of an impending global cataclysm by 2036. Australia, as the world's third-largest exporter of carbon emissions, plays a pivotal role in combating this crisis. Despite 80% of Australians recognising the impacts of climate change and 83% supporting the closure of coal-fired power stations, the government continues to approve new coal and gas projects. This action contradicts Australia's international obligations and the urgent need for drastic emission reductions.</span>

The pandemic treaty scheduled to be adopted in May 2024 hasn't been given discussion or consent of the senate or public before signing and would make this a legally binding treaty. The treaty and the IHR amendments along with the UN political declaration on pandemic prevention preparedness and response are made to work together to create a global health security architecture. The troubling provisions are that it preempts other international agreements, removes liability from vaccines on global level, expands unilateral authority to the WHO, removes the requirement to verify an emergency with a state before making a declaration, the WHO would have a say in how we spend our money, would have the authority to create protocols and rules and determine consequences for not following agreements. We would lose the ability to choose our own health actions as demonstrated by having to follow the IHR regulations during covid rather than our own pandemic plan. The WHO, UN, WEF are controlled by unelected people whose motives are not in our interests but for elite's interests of power, money and control.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">In an era marked by escalating global conflicts and wars, the need for dedicated efforts towards peace and conflict resolution has never been more critical. The continuous growth of international tensions not only threatens the stability of nations but also undermines the collective efforts towards addressing global challenges such as climate change, poverty, and disease. The establishment of a dedicated peace-seeking arm of government, spearheaded by a Minister for Peace, would signify a profound commitment to proactive peacebuilding, diplomatic engagement, and the prevention of conflict. This initiative would serve as a beacon of hope and leadership, inspiring other nations to prioritise peace and diplomacy over aggression and conflict.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Lately, Australia Day has been the subject of a national debate among Australians. </span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">But what if we could find a way to celebrate that unites all Australians, regardless of their stance on the matter? </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Here's the idea: What if we could celebrate Australia Day over three days, representing Australia's past, present, and future? </span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The 26th, representing the past, would be the recognition date for mourning and acknowledging the dark past of Australia's history for Australia's First Nations people and also symbolise a national soliloquy of apology to Indigenous persons and communities, past and present, who have lost their lives under unfair circumstances or suffered from injustice and discrimination.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The 27th, representing the present, would celebrate Indigenous culture, accomplishments, and entertainment. The day will feature cultural performances, Dreamtime Stories, food stalls, art and fashion shows, and more. The 27th would exclusively promote and showcase Indigenous talents and their achievements.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The 28th, representing the future, would celebrate all Australians of all generations, nationalities and backgrounds.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">And all events, celebrations and activities usually held on January 26th in the past would instead be celebrated on January 28th.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">By considering all views of all Australians, we could foster respect and unity without any controversy. This way, Australia Day would no longer be a contentious issue but rather a celebration that brings us all together. </span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The Centenary of Women Suffrage Fountain in Canberra, last updated in 2010, currently does not reflect the significant advancements in women's political participation and representation in the Australian federal parliament adequately. Since its last update, we have witnessed numerous historical milestones, including the election of Nova Peris as the first Indigenous female member of parliament, Anne Aly as Australia's first Muslim female federal politician, and Julie Bishop as the first female Foreign Minister of Australia, among several others. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Additionally, while some firsts have been recognised on the fountain, others are notably and strangely absent. These include Penny Wong's groundbreaking role as the first openly lesbian cabinet minister and the first Asian Australian female parliamentarian. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Furthermore, the fountain currently honours only the women who ran in the 1903 election, omitting those who ran between 1903 and 1943, despite their crucial contributions to our political landscape. This exclusion gives the impression that nothing noteworthy occurred during those years when, in fact, many women were actively participating in politics. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We therefore ask the House to amend, update, and expand the Centenary of Women Suffrage Fountain to include and honour all these significant figures and milestones. This update will ensure the fountain truly reflects Australia's diverse and inclusive history of women's suffrage and political representation. It will serve as a beacon of inspiration and education for current and future generations, highlighting the crucial role women have played in shaping our nation's parliamentary landscape.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia currently has a massive housing supply shortage with people on the average wage unable to afford either buying or renting in all capital cities and many regional areas. Many thousand upon thousands of houses are locked into investments by the so called 'baby boomers' and they will not put these residences up for sale until retirement to evade the capital gains tax. The upshot is that these thousands of properties will not be put onto the market for some years and when they do, they will be exempt from capital gains anyhow.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">We therefore ask the House to have a moratorium on residential property capital gains to encourage many thousands of houses be offered into the housing market many years earlier than would otherwise be the case. The government will not lose capital gains tax revenue as baby boomers are only going to sell the properties once retired and cancel out that tax component anyhow.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The forthcoming Public Health (Tobacco and Other Products) legislation is oppressive and heavy-handed.

              <span class="HPS-Small">This is an unreasonable and disproportionate response to concerns of youth uptake of tobacco products.

              <span class="HPS-Small">Research from several jurisdictions, both domestically and internationally have provided conclusive empirical data suggesting that vapouriser products are a safer alternative to cigarettes and tobacco smoke. For example, a systematic review of vape usage by England's Office for Health Improvement and Disparities has found that: "Vaping poses only a small fraction of the risks of smoking". Similarly, observational studies in Australia have concluded that vaping is associated with increased rates of quitting cigarettes (Chambers MS. Effect of vaping on past-year smoking cessation success of Australians in 2019-evidence from a national survey. Addiction. 2022;117(8)).</span>

As media reported, a main suspect lives in Australia while the victim Zhu Ling, the suspect's uni roommate, died after suffering seriously for about thirty years. A 2013 online White House petition on the whitehouse.gov website, demanding investigation and deportation of the suspect from the US, attracted more than 100,000 signatures in a few days and drew great attention from U.S. and Chinese mainstream media towards the cold case. It is alleged that following the White House petition, the suspect came to Australia with a different name and/or date of birth from her initial information registered in China.

              <span class="HPS-Small">Granting a bridging visa to contributory parent visa applicants in Australia is crucial to harness the positive impact of parents and grandparents in supporting their families and grandchildren. These applicants often play an integral role in childcare, providing emotional and financial support that contributes to the well-being of the entire family. A bridging visa ensures their continued presence, enabling them to actively participate in the upbringing of grandchildren and offering a stable support system. The bridging visa acknowledges the valuable contributions these individuals make to family life, emphasizing the importance of maintaining family unity and connections. It recognizes the potential for parents and grandparents to share cultural values, traditions, and wisdom with younger generations, fostering a sense of identity and belonging. Additionally, this visa facilitates financial assistance and stability, as many contributory parent visa applicants bring financial resources to support their families and invest in the local economy. Ultimately, granting a bridging visa aligns with Australia's commitment to family values, acknowledging the positive role parents and grandparents play in supporting and nurturing the next generation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

Recognition of the significant contributions made by parents and grandparents in childcare and financial support is vital. Inclusive immigration policies should be developed to value family unity, enriching Australian society culturally and socially. Adopting a family-centric approach in visa processing acknowledges the crucial role played by parents and grandparents in nurturing younger generations. </span>

Over past 200 years science have been creating many theories about how the world and everything came about referring to their evolutionary theories.

              <span class="HPS-Small">Our beloved Innovation Youth Centre, is facing a dire situation. IYC has been funded by the Attorney General's office for just two short years. Without an extension, over 500 struggling young people we help in the Whittlesea municipality will be left without support and a safe place to go. Without immediate financial support, it will close and cease its vital services effective March 1st 2024.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">IYC has been a beacon of hope for many young individuals in our community, offering free support services that have made an immeasurable difference in their lives. It has provided them with a safe space where they can learn, grow and thrive amidst life's challenges.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">According to the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS), youth centres like ours play a crucial role in reducing crime rates among young people, providing them with constructive activities and positive role models (ABS 2019). They also contribute significantly towards improving mental health outcomes amongst our youth population (Australian Institute of Health and Welfare 2020).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Please sign this petition today to keep our youth centre open for those who need it most!</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We therefore ask the House to support IYC with additional funding to help sustain our service, relieve the immense pressure on council organisations, reduce crime rates and help enhance the mental health and wellbeing of the next generation of Australia. </span>

For example, a student could complete more than one qualification that results in a total of at least two academic years of study, resulting in an eligible qualification.

              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 7 November 2022 to the Hon Clare O'Neil MP, Minister for Home Affairs and Minister for Cyber Security, enclosing Petition EN4256, with one signature, concerning the designated regional areas in which Skilled Regional (Provisional) (subclass 489) visa holders must live, work and study.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government recognises the important and valuable contribution regional visa holders, including subclass 489 visa holders, make in closing labour and skills gaps and supporting businesses and communities through their commitment to living, working and studying in regional areas of Australia while on a pathway to permanent residence.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Skilled Regional (Provisional) (subclass 489) visa is for persons who are nominated by a state or territory government or sponsored by an eligible family member. Applications to the subclass 489 visa closed in November 2019.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">This visa is subject to condition 8539 which requires the visa holder to live, study and work in an area specified by the Minister in an instrument in writing at the time the visa was granted. This condition does not restrict the visa holder to working solely in the postcode or designated regional area in which they reside. For example, visa holders may live in one designated regional area and work in another. They also have the flexibility to move and live and work in another designated regional area if they so choose.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The subclass 489 visa is one of the qualifying provisional visas for the permanent Skilled—Regional (subclass 887) visa. To be eligible for the subclass 887 visa, subclass 489 visa holders must, along with meeting other requirements, have lived for at least two years and worked full time for at least one year in a specified regional area. If granted, this visa allows holders to live and work anywhere in Australia.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 7 November 2022 regarding petition number EN4301 on solar feed-in tariffs. I appreciate the time you have taken to bring this matter to my attention.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The retail electricity tariff customers pay and the solar tariff consumers receive for exporting solar differs due to a range of reasons. The electricity tariff retailers charge consumers is intended to recover a broader range of costs: the wholesale price (the costs of generating electricity); network costs (the cost to maintain and operate the poles and wires that deliver energy to and from their home); environmental costs and retailer costs.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The solar feed-in tariff is generally set to reflect the expected average wholesale electricity price only, which is the price the retailer would otherwise have to pay if it did not buy the surplus energy from customers with solar systems.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Wholesale prices vary over the course of the day. Growth in rooftop, and utility-scale, solar has increased supply of electricity during the day. This means that wholesale electricity prices are lower when solar exports happen, and this results in lower feed-in tariffs. The main benefit of installing rooftop solar is using what households generate during that day in their home and avoiding the cost of purchasing electricity at the retail price.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Each state and territory has different solar feed-in tariff rates and rules relating to solar tariffs. In jurisdictions where retail competition exists, retailers generally set solar feed-in tariffs to reflect a range of factors including their underlying cost base, their customers solar panel take- up rate and competitive considerations.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Electricity customers in New South Wales, Australian Capital Territory, South Australia, Tasmania and Queensland can compare a range of offers on the Australian Energy Regulator's Energy Made Easy website at www.energymadeeasy.gov.au. Customers living in Victoria can compare offers at www.compare.energy.vic.gov.au. Both websites are free to use and will provide customers with information on offers available in the market, making it easier for them to find the best deal.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">It is important to note the deal with the best feed-in tariff may not be the best deal overall for a customer. A customer should consider an entire energy plan taking into account daily supply charges, feed-in tariffs and any variable charges against their own usage and solar exports to understand which offer best suits their needs.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 28 November 2022 to the Minister for Home Affairs and Minister for Cyber Security, the Hon Claire O'Neil MP, enclosing Petition EN4544. Your correspondence has been referred to me as the matter falls within my portfolio responsibilities. I note that Petition EN4544 concerning current protests in Iran was recently presented in the House of Representative and gathered 69 signatures. I apologise for the delay in responding.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The petition requests the Australian Government to stop issuing or renewing visas for individuals linked to the Iranian regime. The Government continues to protect the Australian community from the risk of harm posed by non-citizens who engage in criminal conduct or behaviour of concern. Most permanent and temporary visas are subject to Public Interest Criteria (PIC) 4003(a) in the Migration Regulations 1994, which states that a visa held by a person whose presence in Australia is, or would be, contrary to Australia's foreign policy interests, may be cancelled.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Any cancellation would be dependent upon the Foreign Minister making a determination under PIC 4003(a).</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The petition also requests that Iranian regime officials not find a safe haven for their assets or families in Australia. Consistent with the approach adopted by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR), Australia prioritises the resettlement of those cohorts who have the greatest resettlement need. This focuses on: </span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government recognises the important role Skilled Regional Provisional visa holders, including subclass 491 visa holders, play in supporting regional economies, employers and communities.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The subclass 491 visa is for applicants who are nominated by a state or territory government or sponsored by an eligible family member who is resident in regional Australia. The subclass 491 visa has advantages compared to other skilled visas including priority visa processing, eligible regional occupations and more points for regional migration. Once granted, visa holders are eligible to enrol in Medicare and a clear pathway to permanent residence is available.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government understands and values the important role that the horticulture industry and skilled migrants play in contributing to Australia's economy. The Government is committed to assisting businesses fill labour shortages where Australian workers are not available. The Pacific Australia Labour Mobility (PALM) scheme continues to be the priority source of temporary migrant workers for Australia's critical sectors.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The PALM scheme remains a key program for meeting agricultural workforce shortages and allows eligible Australian employers to hire employees from nine Pacific Island countries and Timor-Leste. More than 35,000 workers are currently in Australia, with many thousands of pre-screened workers awaiting job offers. While the PALM scheme is an important part of this picture, it is just one of a broader set of solutions.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In addition to the PALM scheme there are a number of visa programs, including industry specific labour agreements to assist employers fill a range of skilled occupations in regional Australia where labour shortages exist. These programs are available to all nationalities including citizens of Bangladesh.

              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 6 February 2023 enclosing Petition EN4612, with 225 signatures, concerning study and work rights equity for asylum seekers. I apologise for the delay in responding.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">A Bridging visa (BV) is a temporary visa that may be granted in certain circumstances. There are multiple BV subclasses, the type of BV granted and the conditions imposed depends on the applicant's specific circumstances. A person's ability to work while in Australia as a BV holder will be determined by the visa conditions that are imposed on their BV at the time of grant. In most cases, BV "A", "B" or "C" subclasses that are typically granted in association with permanent visa applications do not have any conditions attached to them, allowing those BV holders to study and work without any restrictions.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">A Bridging E visa (BVE), is one of the several classes of BV, it allows a person to stay in Australia lawfully for a temporary period of time, while they make arrangements to depart, finalise their immigration matter or await an immigration decision, such as a visa application or judicial review process.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The conditions imposed on BVEs are applied in accordance with the Migration Regulations 1994 (the Regulations). Certain conditions are mandatory and must be imposed by operation of law. Other conditions are discretionary and may be imposed if the delegate is satisfied it is consistent with the purpose of the visa gra nt (there are different BVE 'grounds' under the Regulations—for example BVEs may be granted on what is referred to as 'merits review', 'judicial review', 'Ministerial intervention' or 'departure' grounds—amongst others) and also taking into consideration the individual circumstances of the applicant. The Regulations and Departmental policies act as accountability and consistency safeguards when attaching conditions to a BV.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The 'no work' BVE condition must be imposed in certain circumstances, and in certain circumstances must not be imposed, as stipulated by Regulations. In a limited number of situations where the 'no work' condition is mandatorily imposed, the Regulations provide that a BVE holder may apply for a further BVE in order to have the 'no work' condition removed if they can demonstrate a 'compelling need to work' (based around financial hardship considerations). BVE holders granted in association with an ongoing protection visa applications, would additionally need to demonstrate that there was an 'acceptable reason for delay' in applying for their protection visa, to obtain permission to work. Lastly, there are other circumstances such as BVEs granted on 'departure' grounds, where the 'no work' condition is discretionary from the outset.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Unauthorised Maritime Arrivals (UMA), including transitory persons, are generally granted BVEs with work rights while their immigration status is being resolved. For BVE holders who are seeking merits or judicial review of a refused Protection visa application (this group are primarily non-UMAs) will generally have permission to work if they had work rights on their last substantive visa held.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The 'no study' BVE condition is a discretionary condition (regardless of circumstances). Under current operational policy the 'no study' condition is not imposed on BVEs granted for minors.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">It is open to BVE holders to contact a Departmental Status Resolution Officer (SRO), who can explain their visa conditions and/or options. SROs can also help in referring BVE holders to other support services as required.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">I note the petition would like to see changes made to the Skilled visa requirement, exempting non-citizens who have studied at an Australian university or obtained professional registration from sitting an approved English test as part of the visa process.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The Department of Home Affairs implements Australia's non-discriminatory universal visa system. All non-citizens must have a valid visa to come to Australia or to remain living and working in Australia. Australia's Skilled Migration program is designed to attract migrants who make a significant contribution to the Australian economy, and fill skilled positions where limited Australian workers are available.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Ms Templeman</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 11 September 2023 presenting Petition EN5246—Withdrawal from AUKUS. I have given careful consideration to the matters raised in the petition.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Albanese Government recognises that the first responsibility of a government is to provide for the safety and security of its people. The AUKUS partnership is a core pillar of the Albanese Government's national security policy to protect our nation, its interests and security. We confront the most challenging strategic circumstances since the Second World War, and we do so at a time where Australia's economic connection with the world has never been greater.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">This was at the core of the Defence Strategic Review and the Government's response, delivered in April 2023, which recognised that we must invest in our defence capabilities now: to defend Australia; deter through denial any attempt to project force against Australia; and protect Australia's economic connection to our region and the world.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Albanese Government also recognises that we must contribute to the collective security of the Indo-Pacific because our security and prosperity depend on the stability and security of our region. Yet we need to contend with the reality that our region is witnessing the largest conventional military build-up the world has seen in decades. We do not question the right of countries to invest in and develop defence capabilities, but this must be done transparently and with strategic reassurance. We need to ensure the Indo-Pacific remains a region where all countries-big or small-are able to act in their sovereign interests to shape their own future free from coercion.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The acquisition of conventionally-armed, nuclear-powered submarines will enable Australia to better contribute to a sovereign and resilient Indo-Pacific and to deter aggression more effectively. For a maritime trading nation like Australia maintaining a submarine capability advantage over potential adversaries is vital. Closing or blocking sea lanes would have a devastating impact on Australia's economy and security; and of partners in South East Asia, the Pacific, and globally. By investing in these high-end capabilities, Australia is contributing to a more stable, secure and prosperous region.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We recognise the investment in Australia's conventionally-armed, nuclear-powered submarine program is significant. This will be one of the greatest industrial endeavours Australia has ever undertaken, supporting industry, jobs and infrastructure over decades. It is critical Defence expenditure is used to maximum effect and represents value for money. The Government will establish an independent monitor to provide assurance and advice across the breadth of work to implement Australia's conventionally-armed, nuclear-powered submarine program. Through the work of the independent monitor, there will be greater confidence issues are raised, considered and actioned.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you again for forwarding the Petition EN5246 for my consideration. </span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government has committed to reducing emissions to 43 percent below 2005 levels by 2030 and to net zero by 2050. Nuclear fusion remains an experimental technology and if it is ever developed to the point of commercialisation, it will be developed and commercialised too slowly to help Australia meet these targets. The International Atomic Energy Agency, for example, reports that the construction and operation of demonstration electricity-producing fusion power plants could occur by 2050, depending on funding and technical advancement.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The draft GenCost 2023-24 Report, prepared by the CSIRO and the Australian Energy Market Operator, shows that renewables are the cheapest form of generation for Australia, even when additional costs for storage and new transmission are included. Renewable technologies are quicker to build and between 4 and 7 times cheaper to operate than nuclear power facilities.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The legislative prohibition on the approval of nuclear power plants under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 does not differentiate between nuclear technologies. The Australian Government has no plans to change the longstanding moratorium on nuclear power in Australia, or the laws which prohibit its deployment.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 16 October 2023 regarding petition EN5366 to allow nuclear fusion energy in Australia. I appreciate the time you have taken to bring this matter to my attention.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government has committed to reducing emissions to 43 percent below 2005 levels by 2030 and to net zero by 2050. Nuclear fusion remains an experimental technology and if it is ever developed to the point of commercialisation, it will be developed and commercialised too slowly to help Australia meet these targets. The International Atomic Energy Agency, for example, reports that the construction and operation of demonstration electricity-producing fusion power plants could occur by 2050, depending on funding and technical advancement.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The draft GenCost 2023-24 Report, prepared by the CSIRO and the Australian Energy Market Operator, shows that renewables are the cheapest form of generation for Australia, even when additional costs for storage and new transmission are included. Renewable technologies are quicker to build and between 4 and 7 times cheaper to operate than nuclear power facilities.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The legislative prohibition on the approval of nuclear power plants under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 does not differentiate between nuclear technologies. The Australian Government has no plans to change the longstanding moratorium on nuclear power in Australia, or the laws which prohibit its deployment.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 16 October 2023 enclosing Petition EN5447, with 11,147 signatures, concerning visa options for parents of Australian citizen children under 18 to stay in Australia permanently.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government acknowledges the important role family migration plays in allowing Australian citizens and permanent residents to reunite with their family members, delivering social outcomes for Australia and contributing to social cohesion by strengthening family and community bonds in Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Family stream of Australia's Permanent Migration Program seeks to facilitate the reunification of family members, including partners, children and parents, of Australian citizens, permanent residents and Eligible New Zealand citizens.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The permanent Parent visa program within the Family stream consists of Contributory and non-Contributory visa subclasses. It contains special provisions that enable parents of Australian citizen minor children to apply for a permanent Parent visa. These require that a relative, guardian or community organisation sponsor a parent on behalf of a person who is under 18 years of age.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is aware of concerns related to the Visa Application Charge and processing times for Parent visas.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Visa Application Charge for Parent visas only partially offset the cost of Parent migrants to the Budget, noting that Parent migrants draw upon government services over the span of their lifetime in Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Processing times for permanent Parent visa applications are impacted by a range of factors, including the number of places allocated to a program each year within the broader migration program and the level of demand. High volumes of permanent Parent visa application lodgements, which for a number of years exceeded annual migration planning levels, have impacted on processing times for permanent Parent visas.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 27 April 2023, the Minister for Home Affairs and Minister for Cyber Security, the Hon Clare O'Neil MP, released an outline of the Government's proposed migration strategy 'A Migration System for a More Prosperous and Secure Australia.' It maps the Government's approach for a better targeted, more efficient and outcomes-focused migration system, and notes the need for a reform of the Family program. The Migration Strategy is being developed and will be released at a later date.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 4 December 2023 enclosing Petition EN5459, with 11 signatures to the Hon Clare O'Neil, Minister for Home Affairs and Minister for Cyber Security, concerning processing of Skilled Independent visas (subclass 189) and Skilled Nominated visas (subclass 190). Your correspondence has been referred to me as the matter falls within my portfolio responsibilities. I apologise for the delay in responding.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Reducing the number of on-hand visa applications, including in the subclass 189 and 190 caseloads, has been a priority for the Australian Government. The Department of Home Affairs has been undertaking a range of measures to reduce the processing times for this type of application, and additional resources have been assigned to visa processing.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Under the current Ministerial Direction, the highest priority for general skilled migration applications is being afforded to those visa applications made in relation to healthcare or teaching occupations. Subclass 189 and subclass 190 visa applications that are not made in relation to these specific occupations are given lower priority, and these applications are generally processed in the order in which they were received.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Each application is unique, however, and each is required to meet the eligibility criteria contained in Australia's migration legislation, before a visa can be granted. The time taken to process an application varies depending on a range of circumstances, such as the complexity of the application or whether additional checks and further assessment is required. Some delays in processing are experienced due to character and security checks, along with verification of an applicant's claims. Some applications are also prioritised ahead of others, due to compelling or compassionate reasons.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Currently, 90 per cent of subclass 189 and subclass 190 applications are processed within 12 months. The Department continues to process these applications efficiently, with the intention to further reduce the total number of applications on-hand.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 1 December 2023 regarding Parliamentary Petition EN5468 seeking amendment to the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 (VEA) to allow for the extension of timeframes for lodging requests for reviews of decisions.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">There are currently no plans to amend the arrangements for the review of claims under the VEA. The existing review arrangements are well established and while there is no provision allowing extension of the review period for decisions of the Repatriation Commission under the VEA, the prescribed review periods under the VEA are equal to or more beneficial than those offered by other appeal bodies or jurisdictions.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Since it commenced in 1986, the VEA has placed time limits on applying for review to the Veterans' Review Board (VRB). The timeframes for applying for review to the VRB are 12 or three months depending on the nature of the claim. VRB decisions can also be appealed to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (AAT).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">AAT appeals also have a time limit of three months, however this process has the possibility of extension for the next nine months. AAT decisions can also be appealed to the Federal Court of Australia and a time limit of 28 days applies generally, including to veterans' matters, but with possibility of unlimited extension, under the AAT Act.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Administrative Review Tribunal (Consequential and Transitional Provisions No. 1) Bill 2023 currently before Parliament provides for new VEA subsections 176(4) and (4A) that maintain the current AAT time limits for veterans' matters.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The arrangements proposed for the Administrative Review Tribunal will continue to maintain the beneficial review timeframes for veterans and allow flexibility in the consideration of extensions where appropriate in the veteran's circumstances.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I note the petitioners concerns about the approach and time taken to decide claims. As you may be aware, the Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA) has been receiving a very high number of claims over the past several years. Clearing the claims backlog is a top priority for the Government. I am pleased to advise that DVA has cleared nearly 80 percent of the backlog for Initial Liability and Incapacity Payment claims, and expect to clear the backlog of Permanent Impairment claims by the end of March 2024.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">While an effective review mechanism is an important element of the processes and protections when delivering support for veterans, this is ideally a measure of last resort. This is why the Government will continue acting on recommendations from the Royal Commission to improve the claims process for the veteran community. In line with Royal</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Commission recommendations, there is a proposal under consultation at the moment to have only one Act for compensation claims. This will make it simpler for veterans, their advocates and DVA to process claims, further reduce waiting times and ensure that veterans receive the care and support they deserve.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 1 December 2023 enclosing Petition EN5545, with 60 signatures, concerning processing of Skilled Nominated visas (subclass 190). I appreciate the time you have taken to bring this matter to my attention, and I apologise for the delay in responding.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Reducing the number of on-hand visa applications, including in the subclass 190 caseload, has been a priority for the Government. The Department of Home Affairs has been undertaking a range of measures to reduce the processing times for this type of application, and additional resources have been assigned to the caseload.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Under the current Ministerial Direction, for applications which are not employer sponsored and in relation to an occupation to be carried out in a designated regional area, the highest priority is being afforded to those visa applications made in relation to healthcare or teaching occupations. Subclass 190 visa applications that are not made in relation to these specific occupations are given lower priority, and these applications are generally processed in the order in which they were received.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Each application is unique, however, and each is required to meet the eligibility criteria contained in Australia's migration legislation, before a visa can be granted. The time taken to process an application varies depending on a range of circumstances, such as the complexity of the application or whether additional checks and further assessment are required. Some delays in processing are experienced due to character and security checks, along with verification of an applicant's claims. Some applications are also prioritised ahead of others, due to compelling or compassionate reasons.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Currently 90 per cent of the subclass 190 visas are processed in 12 months, which is consistent with the processing times for other general skilled migration visa applications. The Department continues to process these applications efficiently with the intention to further reduce the total number on-hand.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In relation to travel restrictions associated with the Bridging C visa (BVC), I can advise that a person holding a BVC is able to depart Australia at any time, however, their BVC would cease upon leaving Australia. They would need to apply for, and be granted a new substantive visa in order to return to Australia. On return, they would also need to apply for a further BVC in association with their unfinalised visa application, which would permit their ingoing stay until a decision is made on the application.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for bringing Petition EN5545 to my attention. </span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 12 February 2024 regarding Petition EN5566.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government engages in global health forums to better protect the health and wellbeing of the Australian community. We know certain health threats are more likely to arise overseas and international cooperation helps Australia monitor and respond to these challenges. We also work to strengthen the global health system to prevent and respond more effectively to health challenges, including disease outbreaks and pandemics.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Intergovernmental Negotiating Body, made up of the 194 member countries of the World Health Organization (WHO), was set up to draft and negotiate a new pandemic agreement (or 'treaty'). This is an important opportunity to strengthen global prevention and response systems and reduce the cost of future pandemics.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">While the WHO hosts the negotiations, the new agreement is being negotiated by representatives of the 194 countries themselves—the WHO cannot decide or determine outcomes. Reports on the progress of negotiations is available at https://apps.who.int/gb/inb.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The WHO is, and remains, a Member State-led organisation. The Government is committed to pursuing Australia's priorities and advancing our national interests in global health forums.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Please be assured that under international law, Member States such as Australia retain sovereignty regarding their public health policies.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The WHO has no legal authority to force countries to accept any of its recommendations and can only provide aid and assistance at Member States' request. Further, Australian law can only be changed by an act of the Parliament, not by any international treaty or other legal instrument.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">At this stage, none of the proposed changes or instrument provisions are agreed. Any new instrument that is negotiated will be subject to appropriate parliamentary scrutiny, including consideration by the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties (JSCOT).</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As part of this process, JSCOT undertakes further consultation on proposed treaties by inviting submissions from stakeholders and members of the public. As noted above, any changes to Australian law to implement the new instrument would also have to be considered and passed by Parliament.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

              <span class="HPS-Small">As you may be aware, Home Affairs Portfolio Ministers have personal intervention powers under the Migration Act 1958 (the Act) that allow them to intervene in individual cases if the Minister thinks it is in the public interest.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is very clear to the whole country that the major supermarkets have too much power, and they are doing great harm to farmers and consumers right around Australia. Indeed, last week the member for Kennedy came to the electorate of Calare to draw attention to this behaviour and inform the House of the important work that the independents are undertaking to bring justice and a level playing field to farmers and also to consumers in the way that they interact and deal with the major supermarkets.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just a couple of weeks ago the member for Kennedy and the member for Clark famously dressed up as pigs. It was a lighthearted moment to draw attention to a very, very serious issue. With the Senate inquiry into supermarket prices in Orange last week, the member for Kennedy came to Orange—and, yes, there were a couple of pigs there as well—to draw attention to the fact that the supermarkets' snouts are in the money trough. They are rolling around in massive profits, yet they pay our farmers a pittance and price gouge customers on the way through. Urgent action is required to give our farmers and our consumers a fair go. The point that the member for Kennedy and I were making in Orange last week was that talking about action is not good enough. Words have to be backed up by deeds. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The National Party and the Liberal Party had nine years to tame the supermarket hogs, and they failed. They introduced the grocery code of conduct, and it has turned out to be an absolute dud which has not stopped the price gouging. The National Party and the Liberal Party also introduced laws on the misuse of market power, which have been ineffective in taming the hogs. Calling for the grocery code of conduct to be mandatory is a waste of time. If the grocery code of conduct worked, we wouldn't be having inquiry after inquiry after inquiry. What we want is for the major parties to get behind our Reducing Supermarket Dominance Bill. That's why the Independents are taking action on this. It would significantly shake up the behaviour of the big supermarkets, it would wind back their profit share and level the playing field and it would reduce their supermarket power to 20 per cent over five years. It would also bring in a maximum 100 per cent markup for supermarkets—they're currently marking up by hundreds of per cent—to give farmers and consumers a better deal. The dud Food and Grocery Code of Conduct has failed, and making it mandatory won't do a thing. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We want the National Party, the Liberal Party and the Labor Party—all parties—to not just hold press conferences and talk about taking action. We want them to actually vote in favour of this game-changing legislation. If you're not prepared to back up your big talk with a vote in parliament, it's all about hot air and porkies. We want the major parties to back up their words with deeds. Stop talking the talk and start walking the walk. We want everyone to vote for the Reducing Supermarket Dominance Bill and help get those supermarket snouts out of the trough. Our farmers deserve nothing less. Consumers around our country deserve nothing less. I would urge all members of this House to get behind our game-changing legislation brought to you by the Independents and the crossbench. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms LAWRENCE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hasluck</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:08</span>):  I speak against the specifics of this motion, but in doing so I commend the member for Kennedy for the spirit of the motion and for the care he's shown over now many years for consumers and particularly for the producers of the food we eat. I'll quote the member for Kennedy. In March 2007, speaking on this issue in this place, he said, 'You need to involve people who are at the coalface.' The good member then gave the example of a lychee farm in Kennedy that had a perfectly good product returned by the retailer not for any quality related reason but because of the movement of prices. Kennedy 2007 is a long way from Hasluck 2024, but the same issues persist across our country. If anything, the imbalance of power between producers, distributors and retailers has worsened.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I recently had cause to refer a local matter to the ACCC. Some of my constituents working at the coalface—grape-growing families who have been feeding us for generations—found that their product was suddenly not required and then, by the time it got on the shelves, had been sitting too long to fetch its premium price. This recent story of the table grape growers in the beautiful Swan Valley serves to illustrate the problems we're seeing around the country, because by the time the growers had contacted me they were already facing significant losses—through no fault of their own. As I said, some of these growers have been producing and supplying grapes to the local market for over 50 years. But, with product on the vine and picking imminent, to be informed that their varieties would no longer be accepted by the major retailers is a situation that is untenable—they received no proper notice and no good reason. Finding a market, obviously, is challenging when you only have a very small supermarket retail chain. As the member for Kennedy has said previously, where an imbalance of power is exercised in relation to perishable goods—and of course much of our agricultural product is just that—producers have nowhere to go. It's simply impractical to say, 'Well, we'll find another market.' It isn't going to happen easily in Kennedy, nor in Hasluck. The concentration of retail power is a huge part of this; another part, a real chokepoint, is the situation where there's a sole distributor sitting between producers and the few retailers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Additionally, many fruits and other products these days are the subject of proprietary strains and many of these patented products are owned by international interests. They license few growers and fewer distributors, and they guard their intellectual property jealously. They have an interest in seeing their products advanced and others shut out from the supermarket shelves. This was very much the experience unfolding in my electorate amongst the grape growers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Kennedy will agree that little has occurred in this policy space over the nine years of the coalition government. The Liberal and the National administrators were a conga line of hopelessness across many areas of government—and we just heard a reference to the code which they introduced as a dud. In contrast, the Albanese government is acting in the competition space, and I'll mention a few of ways in a moment. Both the Treasurer and the assistant minister for competition, the member for Fenner, are clearly interested in reform in this sector. Further, the Standing Committee on Economics, of which I'm a member, has also been inquiring into competition and economic dynamism, and will report very shortly. I acknowledge the leadership of the committee chair, the member for Fraser. The member for Fraser was born in Italy, where five companies share about 75 per cent of supermarket retail, which we may well say is actually twice as healthy as competition here. Most international comparisons indicate that we do have a serious issue. The member for Kennedy has made that point many times over the years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To the motion: we're actually introducing serious reform. We've increased the penalties for anti-competitive conduct; we've banned unfair contract terms; we've initiated the Treasury's Competition Taskforce; we're legislating for a new designated complaints functions within the ACCC; we've commissioned the ACCC review of supermarket pricing; and, importantly, we have also initiated a review into that dud food and grocery code that we heard referred to previously. We've also funded CHOICE to provide comparison information for consumers. We are taking it seriously. We will take action.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Monash</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:13</span>):  I seconded this motion for a reason: I seconded this motion so that this parliament would discuss the issue around the size of the market held by supermarkets. Philosophically, I probably don't sit well with the motion that Mr Katter has put forward but I'm happy to second it so that the parliament can have the discussion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Access to healthy, fresh food should not be a luxury in this country. We all realise the prices people are paying at the moment seem to be inflated beyond their control and beyond the household budget. What we're facing here is that the market dominance of the supermarkets is probably unprecedented in nations around the world. If we compare ourselves with the UK, the biggest player in their market is around 28 per cent. In the US the biggest player in the market is around 25 per cent. In Australia the biggest player in the market is 37 per cent. With our second-biggest player having a larger nominal share than the share that the largest supermarket in the US has, just two supermarkets account for 60 per cent of the market share and prove how lacking competition is in the sector. You already know which two supermarkets I'm talking about.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, there's a choice. In Melbourne you can seek out a retailer that may be a long way away from you but will give you a better price. I asked a customer the other day—I'm not sure whether I'm allowed to name names here—in the ALDI store, 'Do you believe you get a better price shopping at ALDI than you do at the major supermarkets?' She said: 'Absolutely. This is my major shop for the week.' It was about $275 for her major shop. She lives with her daughter. In that process, she said, 'Yes, I think I'm this many dollars better off by shopping at that particular store.' So in Australia you can still seek out, if you're prepared to look and travel, opportunities for independent supermarkets.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Where I have a problem with the bill put forward is that, even though the member for Hasluck a few minutes ago outlined all the programs that the government has in place to fight against the monopoly, the market happens very quickly. I'm a former retailer. The market happens on that day in that week in that time. By the time all the inquiries that you might have with the ACCC or any other body over price gouging are held and done, the damage is done. It's all over—it's finished—for the retailer. In my own area, when a major player in the market in my industry came in to my community, I knew that our retail model was over, finished, gone. It took a long time for me to explain that to my family—that we were now finished—because we couldn't compete in the marketplace with such an enormous organisation. Therefore, businesses like mine disappeared not just in my area but right across Australia because the big organisation came in and took over from the very small.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the inquiry that's currently going on in Australia with regard to food prices—or whatever the inquiry is called—it was really interesting to hear the apple growers and what they're going through at the moment and the fact that many of them are ripping their plants out of the ground because they can't put apples on the shelf—you'd know this in South Australia—because of what it costs them to produce it. In fact, the gap is enormous. Some of their produce is perfect to eat, but, because it's slightly the wrong colour, it gets rejected, for heaven's sake. So 30 per cent of this beautiful product here in Australia is thrown out or sent back to the grower just to be ploughed in or thrown down the tip.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What I'm putting to the House is that it's good to have this discussion around how we deliver food into households in Australia but remember that we're dealing with a marketplace which is moving quickly every day and you've got to be a very big supplier to supply a very big supermarket, so the smaller man is left out. If you want that to change, you have to change how you are supporting the smaller operators and the smaller growers.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Adelaide</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:18</span>):  I'd like to thank the member for Kennedy for moving this motion, for highlighting such an important issue that we have in this nation at the moment—that is, the duopoly of the supermarkets. I couldn't agree more with the member for Monash on some of his comments in terms of the two retailers for supermarket goods having a 37 per cent share of everything sold in this nation. But if you add on to that all their other retail outlets—liquor stores and a whole range of other things—it actually adds up to 70 per cent. So two retailers in this nation have a 70 per cent market share of everything being sold in retail in this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is astonishing when you think about how we have let ourselves come to this, to have a duopoly of two massive supermarkets selling 70 per cent of everything that's sold in retail, from petrol right through to what is sold at bottle shops—liquor, wines et cetera. It is humungous. In most other countries they would be divested and broken up, but we've allowed them to take hold in this nation. We're seeing an unprecedented rise in supermarket costs at the moment. I speak regularly to people in my electorate, and they're doing it tough. It is the biggest expense that they have in the family budget. Going to the supermarket is a necessity. It's not like saying you'll get a new TV or a new pair of shoes, or putting off that holiday because you can't afford it. The supermarket is a necessity. You must go there every week to shop and to feed your family. It is a terrible situation that we're in.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the small investigations that I've done is on Nescafe, a popular brand we all know. Twelve months ago, a 500-gram tin of Nescafe was retailing at these outlets for approximately $14 to $16. Today that price is $28, a 100 per cent increase. You may say that energy prices and a whole range of other costs have gone up, but this is a 100 per cent increase on one particular product, and there are many other products that we're seeing the two big supermarkets raising the prices for.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We do listen to our constituents, and that's why on this side of the House we are rolling up our sleeves and doing everything that we can in our electorates to get a fair deal for our constituents. On top of a lot of other things with the cost of living, we've slashed the cost of medicines, improved paid parental leave, and done a whole range of other things to try and assist families. We want to ensure that supermarkets are doing the right thing by our constituents. We want to make sure that there's no gouging taking place. We want to make sure they are being fair—of course, fair to the point where they can make a profit for their shareholders but, at the same time, charge fair prices to the Australian people. The aim is to make Australia fair, whether you're a consumer, a business owner or a farmer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To address this issue, we've initiated a thorough review through the ACCC to examine supermarket pricing, which hasn't been done for well over 10 years. This 12-month inquiry is a significant effort. It hasn't been done since 2008. We want to make sure that every dollar that Australians spend in supermarkets goes a long way because Aussies deserve a fair go. Many years ago, when I was growing up in the western suburbs of Adelaide, just around the corner from our street we had four little shops. Self-employed families ran these shops. Today there are none. There are no butchers and there are no small shops selling bread, milk, butter et cetera. We have two massive supermarkets in that area, and all these other little shops have closed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that when some of these big multinationals make the plans to open up a supermarket they can actually run at a loss for 10 years—which does what? Initially you'd get cheaper prices, but eventually everything shuts around them and they have a complete monopoly on everything that's being sold. That's why the ACCC's inquiry is going to cover various aspects, including the pricing practice and other practices; the challenges faced by smaller retailers, especially in regional and remote areas; factors affecting price along the supply chain; and potential obstacles to fair competition. What we need is more competition, fair competition and more players in the market, but certainly the ACCC will get to the bottom of this.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="181810" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms TEMPLEMAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macquarie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:24</span>):  The multiple inquiries into Australia's duopoly supermarket model have begun receiving submissions and taking evidence. It's the start of really putting a spotlight on why prices are so high at the checkout at the same time as farmers are being squeezed. Labor knows that cost-of-living pressures, especially the cost of groceries, are affecting people. The Albanese government has commissioned an ACCC review of supermarket pricing, an independent review of the food and grocery code and ongoing updates from Choice to help consumers make informed decisions about where they shop. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In its submission to the ACCC inquiry, Choice has argued the two main supermarket chains routinely manipulate prices to the detriment of customers. It says the 'complex pricing methodologies lack both transparency and accountability'. We know that Choice is firmly on the shopper's side, and we're providing Choice with a million dollars so they can give price transparency and comparison reports on a quarterly basis for the next three years. This will start from this current quarter and will provide shoppers with increased transparency, comparing a basket of goods at various retailers to help Australians be really informed about where they shop. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's no question that you see higher profit levels for supermarkets in Australia than you do for supermarkets in many other countries. That market power is an issue for both suppliers and consumers. That's why we're talking about better prices. We want to make sure that if prices are dropping at the farm gate they're also dropping at the checkout and that there's a clear flow through for customers. If farmers aren't getting as much for their products, consumers shouldn't be paying as much for those very same products. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The ACCC inquiry will examine the competitiveness of retail prices for everyday groceries. The 12-month inquiry will look at the current structure of the supermarket industry at the supply, wholesale and retail levels. It'll consider competition in the industry and how it's changed since 2008, including the growth of online shopping, and the competitiveness of small and independent retailers, including in regional and remote areas. The pricing practices of supermarkets and factors impacting competition and influencing prices along the supply chain, including the difference between farm gate and supermarket prices, will be looked at as well. The ACCC released their issues paper last month, and submissions to the inquiry and a consumer survey are now open. I'd encourage people to have their say. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Dr Craig Emerson, former competition minister, is also reviewing the food and grocery code, which regulates business dealings between farmers, suppliers, wholesalers and supermarkets and addresses harmful practices in the grocery sector that stem from that imbalance of bargaining power—the big guys versus the little guys. The review will test whether the code is effectively contributing to the food and grocery industry as intended, including whether the code should be mandatory rather than voluntary and whether it should have appropriate penalties. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also have the benefit of the inquiry into price gouging and unfair pricing practices the ACTU commissioned, which found that corporate profits have added significantly to inflation, that many businesses are resorting to dodgy price practices and that a range of sectors are insufficiently competitive or regulated, leading to poor consumer outcomes and higher prices. The report will be considered as part of the ACCC inquiry, and I congratulate the ACTU on shining a light on pricing practices that rip off customers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the meantime, I'd really urge shoppers in my community to look to local growers, either at the growers' market, where you know that the price you pay is going directly to the producer, or the longstanding businesses like Sciberras, Todarellos and IGAs, who are part of their local communities. And of course Aldi is accessible in some parts of the electorate. Depending on your commute, it might be easy to swing by Riverview Produce at Agnes Banks, Enniskillen Orchard or the Local Farm Shop in Windsor Mall, one of the newer entrants. I've always urged people to shop local in the mountains and at Hawkesbury, and new shops like Sangkap International Grocer in Springwood and Hartleys Fruit and Vegetable Specialty Grocer in Richmond are a great reminder to try your local shops first. That also means buying products that are made locally, whether it's our local wines, beers and gins or Kurrajong Kitchen Lavosh. Our region's a source of great local produce and goods, and you know what you're spending is going right back into your community. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="282335" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr HAINES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Indi</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:29</span>):  When I speak to people in my electorate of Indi, whether it is a small town like Jamieson or a hub like Wangaratta or Wodonga, overwhelmingly people talk about the high cost of living and the pressures on their budget that make it harder to keep their heads above water. As their voice in this place, it is my duty to tell the government that the people of Indi want no stone left unturned when it comes to measures that will assist with the cost of living. I know that many members of the government would answer that by saying, 'Well, we've changed the stage 3 tax cuts!' Yes, that is welcome, but it can't be the end of the story. Some 95 per cent of taxpayers in Indi will benefit from the new stage 3 tax cuts, and I'm impatiently waiting for 1 July for those people in my community to see that extra money in their pay cheques each week.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But in communities like mine, where household incomes are well below the national average, there are many people for whom the tax cuts won't make any difference. In fact, there are 25,000 people in the electorate of Indi with incomes below the tax-free threshold who won't see a difference in their bank balances come 1 July. We know that the government is preparing the federal budget, and it is these people who must be top of mind when decisions are made on cost-of-living measures. The Treasurer told us last week not to expect a cash splash in the budget, which I think misses the point. There is plenty the government can be doing on the cost of living that goes further than cash handouts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As an independent member of parliament I make it my mission to come here not only bringing complaints and criticisms but also bringing solutions. So I hope the Treasurer is taking note, because I'm here with ideas to address the cost of living. First, pass my cheaper home batteries bill, which would address many of the challenges we face. Households with solar panels would be able to keep more of the energy they generate, spending less on their power bills. If we had as many home batteries as we have home solar systems, we could reduce the need for grid-scale energy across the country. This is a massive opportunity. Then, back the people's power plan from the member for Wentworth—measures that would help people who don't have access to household solar and batteries to reduce their own bills and emissions at the same time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But energy bill savings can't be just for households. They need to be for businesses, too. The Energy Efficiency Grants for Small and Medium Enterprises program has benefited many businesses in my electorate of Indi, but there are so many more who want to take part. And when people talk to me about cost-of-living pressures they talk to me about the cost of housing. That's why I introduced the unlocking regional housing bill to kickstart housing supply across regional Australia and make more housing available to stop people getting squeezed out of their homes by rising rents and mortgage repayments. And addressing price gouging at the major supermarkets is urgent. We need measures with real penalties for the big two that protect us as consumers and protect the farmers who grow our fresh produce, so many of whom are in the electorate of Indi.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Health care is another area where people in Indi are feeling rising costs, and in this area I will acknowledge some of the government's real positive work. Tripling the GP bulk-billing incentive has led to a 5.9 per cent increase in the rate of bulk billing in Indi, with an estimated 6,958 bulk-billed appointments. That's an estimated saving of $309,700 in gap fees in just two months. We know that making it easier and cheaper to see the doctor helps people with the cost of living, but this needs to go further than just doctors. We need better access to primary healthcare nurses, nurse practitioners, psychologists and allied health professionals like occupational therapists and speech therapists, as well as to fund their full scope of practice. This must be a priority come budget time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Reducing the cost of higher education would also assist my constituents with the cost of living through providing more fee-free TAFE, fixing HECS repayments and paying students to complete compulsory placements as part of their training and education. And, for those on the lowest incomes who are relying on social welfare payments like JobSeeker, the age pension, student payment assistance and rent assistance, those payments need to go up—not just to meet inflation, but further.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There you go, Treasurer: measures that can help people with their energy bills, the cost of housing, the cost of groceries, the cost of education and the cost of health care. So I say to you: get on and do these things. They won't increase inflation. They're not about a cash splash. They're about sensible, well-thought-through, evidence based solutions for the people who need them most. Thank you.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Corangamite</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:34</span>):  Many fruit and vegetable growers and primary producers are struggling to keep their businesses afloat because the two major supermarket chains are strangling them with inequitable contracts that disadvantage the farmer. The supermarkets demand perfect cherries, flawless zucchinis and completely unblemished apples, and if those ridiculous standards aren't met they won't pay the farmer a fair price. As one cherry producer said last week prior to his appearance before the Senate inquiry into supermarket prices, 'People don't understand how ruthless the supermarkets are.' This is why we've initiated a review into the Food and Grocery Code of Conduct, an important first step to rein in the power of major supermarkets. We've also commissioned an ACCC inquiry to examine the competitiveness of retail prices for everyday groceries. This 12-month inquiry will consider the pricing practices, the current structure of the supermarket industry and the role of small and independent retailers, particularly in regional and remote areas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government have enacted these reviews because we know the status quo isn't sustainable. For example, in the Senate inquiry last week several farmers stated that despite their best efforts to remain competitive they are still receiving the same price for their produce as they did in 2011. If this continues, it may mean Australia becomes more reliant on imported produce as our local fruit and vegetable growers and primary producers go out of business. This would be tragic. Our nation is known for quality fresh produce, and the agricultural industry employs many hundreds and thousands of people, many of those in my electorate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are at a crossroads when it comes to supporting local producers and protecting consumers. This is reflected in the view of my constituents in Corangamite—people who are doing it tough, like single mums, pensioners, students and those on low wages. When I'm at the markets or out doorknocking, these people tell me their grocery bills are rising significantly, and they're pointing the finger at Coles and Woolworths. Meg, from Torquay, is an occupational therapist, and she told me that despite being in this profession she is increasingly shocked and challenged by the prices at the checkout. She said: 'It's insane. Over the last five years the prices of my grocery basket have gone up and up.' Our government shares Meg's concerns, and we are acting. We've appointed Dr Craig Emerson to lead the review into the grocery code of conduct. The Emerson review will test the effectiveness of the code to police the food and grocery industry to ensure farmers are not unfairly treated.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is about making sure families and our farmers get a fair go, because, when farmers are selling their produce for less, supermarkets should charge Australians less. Having a diverse market, we avoid a duopoly that forces farmers to sell their products for less than their real value, at times leaving the farmer without a profit margin. Before you buy, consider shopping at your local greengrocer or butcher, and encourage diversity, local employment and investment in regional economies. Get served by a local business owner and connect with your local community. Have your groceries packed by a young student rather than packing them yourself.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The ACCC will provide their findings and recommendations to government in early 2025, and we will work with the ACCC to ensure shoppers are given a fair deal. The government is also providing CHOICE with $1.1 million to provide price transparency and comparison reports on a quarterly basis for three years. Moreover, these inquiries and initiatives are all about taking action on cost-of-living challenges and ensuring Australians have an economy that works for them. That's why, along with these inquiries, we're delivering a tax cut for every Australian taxpayer. This means more dollars in the pockets of all Australians across my electorate and the nation—more than $1,500 for a local worker on an average wage.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, we know that more competition is better for consumers, farmers and our nation. More importantly, we want more competition that means better prices at the checkout and more dollars in the pockets of Australians.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dawson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:39</span>):  This motion acknowledges the cost-of-living pressures, including the cost of groceries putting Australians under the pump. This is exactly what those of us on this side of the House have been talking about for a long time. We have been pleading with those opposite to do something about the cost-of-living pressures for well over 12 months. The unfortunate reality is that we are living in a Labor created cost-of-living crisis, and those opposite have failed to provide any real help or any real assurance to the people of Australia that they're going to do something—absolutely anything—about this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to highlight the disappointing section of the motion where the member for Spence states:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… these measures are further examples of the Government ensuring everyone is doing their bit when it comes to easing the cost of living …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What a joke! When I think of the Albanese Labor government, I don't think that they have ensured anything other than a pack of broken promises and ill-advised policymaking, inflating or stroking their own political agendas and egos.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What does come to mind when I think of the Albanese Labor government is the following: burying their heads in the sand about the cost-of-living pressures facing Australians, while choosing to spend millions of dollars on a divisive and failed referendum; 12 interest rate rises, forcing mortgages and rents up; housing costs rising by 12 per cent; promising 97 times that we would see $275 reductions in our power bills, when in reality, our electricity prices are now up by 20 per cent; fuel prices increasing; insurance costs up by 22 per cent; and food costs up by nine per cent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite have implemented tax after tax on our major industries, penalising the hardworking Australians who greatly contribute to our economy. This is making our cost of living worse. Now, they're trying to push a turbocharged vehicle emissions policy on the people of Australia which will force car prices to increase by up to $25,000—and that's not even taking into account the fact that these price increases could push some vehicle costs up so high that they will now incur the luxury car sales tax on top of that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For a long time now, the coalition has been calling on the Prime Minister and his government to direct the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to conduct an inquiry into the competitiveness of retail prices and allegations of price gouging in the supermarket sector. We have been calling for this for a very long time, while the Labor government seems to have finally started to realise how bad the situation is and is doing the absolute bare minimum by announcing the ACCC inquiry into supermarket prices. The fact that they've only just announced this, in February, and we won't see the final report until the end of February next year, is shameful.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I always like to look at the positive side of things, and I would love to be able to say, 'better late than never', but unfortunately, for the people of Australia, this is far too late.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Under this Albanese Labor government, we have seen families struggle to decide whether to either pay their rent or mortgage, buy their medication or feed their families—because at the moment they can't do all three.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've seen the housing crisis worsen. More and more families and individuals in Dawson are being displaced, living in their cars or in tents or even on the street. Which demographic is hurting most? It's those that can't afford to cut their budget any further. It's the single parents trying to feed, clothe and house their children. These single parents are skipping meals just so their children can eat. It's the younger generations trying to put themselves through uni or work through an apprenticeship on the minimum wage. It's the older generations trying to live off their pensions. Over 50 per cent of people in Australia are only just making ends meet—or actually failing to do so.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While the announcement of the ACCC inquiry into supermarket price gouging is a step in the right direction, the cost-of-living crisis has already taken so many victims hostage. This announcement has come far too late and should have come a long time ago. This announcement is what the people of Australia and the people of my electorate deserved months ago. The Albanese Labor government is failing Australians, and they need to do better.</span>

As we all know, cost-of-living pressures are putting Aussies under incredible pressure—some more than others. I wasn't going to mention the incredible contribution by the previous speaker, the member for Dawson—and when I say 'incredible' I mean 'unbelievable'—but then he brought in the member for Spence. Because the member for Spence is not here, I think it's worth pointing out that under that mob opposite, if you were earning under 40 grand, you got nothing under the stage 3 tax cuts. That's how much they were committed to helping people on low wages with the cost of living. The honourable member said that they'd been working on it for a year—</span>

                  </a>  I understand why the honourable member is leaving. Whether it's shopping with the big two, Coles and Woolies, filling up the car or paying energy bills, Australians are doing it tough. That's why we have directed the ACCC to conduct this pricing inquiry. I think it's been welcomed by all Australians, because we do need to look at the lack of competitiveness in this sector. There are lots of cons going on and there's lots of gouging going on. Whenever you see market concentration you see airlines colluding, petrol stations colluding or supermarkets perhaps not doing the best that they can, not being ethical in the work that they do as a provider of food security in our nation. It is disappointing when we see these corporate behaviours, but we're committed to doing everything that we can to make sure that Australians get a fair go, that's what Labor do. Greater transparency around pricing, which is going to be great for the farmers as well, is going to help everyone—and the big two will still make good profits. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But this is only one of our measures to help Aussies that are doing it tough at the moment. We have been delivering some power bill relief, particularly for those who are less able to pay those power bills. I'm thinking of the concession card holders in our electorate who are paying aircon bills. It's difficult, and that assistance is very welcome and needed. Our tax legislation was all about relief and reform, so all Australians got some tax relief and had a bit more of the money that they earned in their pockets to look after themselves and their families. To be honest, after almost 10 years those opposite had put us in a position where we've had to take actions like this, and we will continue to take actions like this, to fix a number of elements of our economy. We will continue to do that, through consultation, to make sure that Australian consumers are getting fairer prices. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also looked at a range of ways in which we could pump-prime the NT economy, if I can concentrate on the beautiful place where I live. It was great to have the cabinet up in Darwin last week. </span>

Whether it be health or education, where we have put funding—fee-free TAFE, more university places. We want every Territorian to have a job and to be able to get a job, and then we will be able to grow our economy, and that will help families throughout the Territory with the cost of living.

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="297660" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr RYAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kooyong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:49</span>):  Australians are living through a once-in-a-generation cost-of-living crisis. Most of us have never experienced anything like this before. It's a really tough time for many people, and it's a time when we can decide either to pull together or to swim alone. Throughout 2023, the living cost indexes—the wage price index and the CPI—rose by between 5.3 and nine per cent. Households dependent on income from wages and salaries recorded the highest annual rise in living costs of all household types, at nine per cent—this at a time when our mortgage interest rates were increasing by 68 per cent. The cost of living in Australia is now greater than in 87 per cent of countries around the world. Families are feeling the strain, and it's time that we had an open conversation about the impact of these rising costs and how best to alleviate them for older and younger Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Firstly, housing affordability: the dream of owning a home, the great Australian dream, is becoming increasingly elusive for many Australians. Property prices have skyrocketed, especially in major cities like my own, Melbourne, and Sydney. Young families are burdened with increasingly hefty mortgages, or they're being forced into an incredibly tight rental market in which rents are also on the rise. Young people in my electorate are looking at 30 or 40 rental apartments before they can secure one. We're also seeing increasing numbers of retirees who are in significant rental stress and increasing numbers of homeless people, particularly women aged over 50.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the same time, we're dealing with increasing energy costs. In a part of the world where we have the world's cheapest renewable energy, one side of the polity in this country is pushing for options which are both blinkered and retrograde. At the same time as that, we're sending 70 per cent of our oil and gas overseas while we're paying world-high prices for electricity. We need the government to take action on this. We need more energy efficiency measures. We need to work on distributed energy networks and making measures like home electrification—with rooftop solar, batteries and electric vehicle rollouts—more affordable and more accessible for all Australians. We will all benefit if we have less sovereign dependency on overseas fossil fuels.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our healthcare system is world class, but it comes at a significant cost and it needs a once-in-a-generation review. Medicare is no longer fit for purpose. At the same time, rising health insurance premiums and out-of-pocket expenses for medical treatments, as well as increasing costs for prescription medicines, are impacting all of us. We have to have a quality healthcare system. We've always benefited from it during most of our lifetimes, but it's becoming unaffordable, and many people are experiencing increasing out-of-pocket costs at a time when they can least cope with that sort of thing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We come to HECS. Young Australians are dreading the increase in their HECS debts with the indexation that will occur on 1 July. I and my crossbench colleagues have spoken to the education minister on a number of occasions regarding the need to change this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As to consumer protections, I note that groceries, aviation, transport and insurance—all of these industries—have been left to the market forces in the last nine years, and we've seen what market forces have done. The lack of competition and the lack of consumer protections are costing us all. When you go to the supermarket, you see people picking things up and putting them back on the shelf. You see people sidling in at five o'clock, hoping that the chooks are half price and the meat trays have been reduced. This is not something that any of us have seen in our previous lifetimes. This is not a country that we recognise.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our national anthem tells us that we have wealth for all, but we only have wealth for all if we govern responsibly and with wisdom. Housing, health, disability, education, energy and climate change remediation are all things that this country can address effectively, well and constructively if we do it together and we govern well.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="132880" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr MULINO</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fraser</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:54</span>):  Clearly, cost of living is an issue affecting people in communities right across this country. It affects people in communities represented by every member of this chamber. I hear about it day in, day out when I talk to people. It's the government's No. 1 priority.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Before talking about supermarkets in particular, I do want to note that this government is dealing with the cost of living with a very wide range of measures, including material, significant and fair changes to the stage 3 tax cuts, which those opposite complained about but reluctantly voted for. A whole range of measures in our first two budgets are dealing with issues such as rent relief, energy bill relief, cheaper medicines and a whole raft of other measures. So the cost of living is the government's No. 1 priority, and we are dealing with it through a range of targeted measures that also represent responsible overall fiscal economic management.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to supermarkets, this is an area that warrants particular attention. That's why it's so important that the government has initiated an ACCC inquiry and that Dr Craig Emerson is looking at the Food and Grocery Code of Conduct and why CHOICE has been given money for monitoring and greater transparency. I do want to note that actions have already been undertaken. For example, the assistant minister for Treasury, Dr Andrew Leigh, has strengthened a range of measures and sanctions in relation to anticompetitive behaviour—that, of course, following a decade of complete inaction. These are important measures.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I should also say that the committee which I chair, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Economics, was provided with a reference by the Treasurer 15 months ago to look at competition, and that was a very important reference which not only included a raft of economywide issues, such as mergers, but also required the committee to look at a series of important sectors which included retail and supermarkets. We are hoping to table a report in the House on that inquiry soon.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But what I can say is that the evidence that we received from public policy experts, previous chairs of the ACCC and government agencies all pointed to the fact that there are a range of measures across the economy that give an indication of competition and overall economic dynamism. Market share, the degree of firm entry and exit, and margins are three of the key measures that are used. In relation to all of those three measures, there are concerns when it comes to supermarkets and the retail sector. That's why it's so important that the government has initiated a series of reviews. The inquiry that the House of Representatives committee has undertaken received evidence not only from key players in the retail sector and from key players in the supermarket sector but also from a range of other experts, as I indicated—from ex-chairs of the ACCC, from academic experts and from a range of other public policy experts. So we will be feeding in to the public policy discussion as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to also note that, when it comes to the Food and Grocery Code of Conduct, Dr Emerson is undertaking an important review, but there has already been a review when it comes to the dispute resolution provisions of that code. That report, which was provided in September 2023 and which the government has favourably responded to, involves a number of measures which will strengthen dispute resolution measures within that code of conduct. That is critically important because it is the dispute resolution aspects of that code which are often the pointy end of the way in which primary producers, agricultural producers, deal with supermarkets with significant market share. That's already a significant stage, and now, of course, Dr Emerson is going to be reviewing aspects of the code other than the dispute resolution processes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, there's the ACCC review. It is absolutely critical that the ACCC look at the supermarket sector in detail—to look at the degree of competition, to look at supply chain issues and to look at pricing practices. These are all the key terms of reference of the ACCC, with its very extensive and powerful data-gathering powers and with its very extensive analytical powers. This review will be absolutely critical. As I said, the committee that I was on received a lot of evidence on this issue and the findings and recommendations that we put to this House in the coming sitting weeks will be complemented and built upon materially, I'm sure, by the ACCC in its major review. So this government sees the cost of living as critical, including when it comes to supermarket prices.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="281688" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr WEBSTER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mallee</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:59</span>):  A few months ago, I wrote to my constituents across Mallee to ask them how they were going in this cost-of-living crisis. Their stories were harrowing, with many going without meals—if you can call toast a meal. The Albanese Labor government have been distracted with pet projects and with rewarding the union movement and others that got them into government, rather than focusing on the cost of living. They claim that their broken promise on the stage 3 tax cuts, adjusting the rates, now passed in this place, will help with the cost of living. But that relief will not arrive in voters' pay packets until 1 July, and, even then, they will be receiving around one-tenth of what they're losing currently.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Corangamite spoke about the struggles primary producers are facing under the major supermarkets—perfectly correct. The latest behaviour by the supermarkets has happened on Labor's watch. The Albanese Labor government were embarrassed into having the ACCC inquiry she spoke of, after sustained advocacy from the Leader of the Nationals and from the National Party.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me reflect on energy bills. The upcoming draft default market offer released by the Australian Energy Regulator will announce the reference price for electricity bills in coming weeks for the 2024-25 period. Labor's election pledge to reduce household electricity bills by $275 is set to be another broken promise, unless the upcoming regulated price actually decreases by more than $1,200. The Prime Minister must apologise to everyday Australians hit by skyrocketing power bills if there is less than $1,238 in reductions in their power bills.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mallee families are paying more and more under Labor, whether it be at the supermarket checkout or the petrol bowser or in simply to keep their lights on. The Albanese Labor government is making a habit of failing to deliver on its promises, from 24/7 registered nurses in aged care to not changing the stage 3 tax cuts, and is now failing to deliver on cost-of-living relief through reduced power prices.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The impact of high energy prices continues to be felt by industry as well as by families. Mallee's manufacturers and small businesses are being driven to the wall. Mildura Fruit Juices Australia, for example, previously anticipated its energy costs would increase to $1 million, forcing the company to reduce their grape intake as energy price hikes made it unviable to evaporate grapes into concentrate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor simply does not care about the rising cost of living. Instead, they're railroading costly and unwanted renewable and transmission-line projects in regional areas and compromising productivity, while simultaneously saddling families with higher prices to pay for this new infrastructure.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Inflation is running at 4.1 per cent persistently, well above the two to three per cent target. Our core inflation in Australia is 4.2 per cent—higher than in the US, Spain, the Netherlands, Germany, Singapore, France, Italy, South Korea, Canada, Japan and the entire Euro area. This sits squarely at the feet of the Albanese Labor government. As a result, during the Albanese government's term, the Reserve Bank has met on 19 occasions, increasing rates 12 times and keeping them on hold seven times. But also, last week, the Treasurer was talking about spending because he was worried about the cost-of-living crisis which Labor has created. So he's going to deliver a surplus, but spend more and tax less. It's the usual economic magic pudding of Labor governments.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just on Saturday, we saw the consequences for Labor of neglecting the cost-of-living crisis in Queensland. This was a cost-of-living election, and the two leaders actually debated only in the final days of the campaign on cost of living. My voters in Mallee are feeling that cost-of-living pain that's been made in Canberra and in red states across the nation. From Prime Minister Albanese to the Labor premiers, they should be very concerned about making sure that they are attacking the real issue, which is cost-of-living pressures here across Australia. The coalition warned it would not be easy under Albanese, and now, more than ever, this prediction is coming to pass.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is nothing more important than the safety of children, and there is nothing more important than protecting the safety of children online. Who should we trust on this issue? Who is the top expert in Australia when it comes to protecting the safety of children online? It's the eSafety Commissioner.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">About three years ago the coalition asked the eSafety Commissioner to look into the issue of age verification, which is about ensuring that children do not access content that is dangerous for them, particularly pornography, but it can be other things as well. The eSafety Commissioner spent two years looking into this. She came back to the government and said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… implement a trial of age-assurance technology to protect children from dangerous online content, particularly pornography …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">building on the very good work of the member for Fisher and many other esteemed members who were on a committee that looked into this issue some years ago. The eSafety Commissioner said: 'Do something. Run a trial. Mandate that a trial must occur with a view to putting in place a formal system after that trial.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But what did the government say? The government said: 'No. We're not going to do that. Instead we're going to let the industry write the rules.' The industry here is the pornography industry. That's what the Minister for Communications said. She didn't want to do what the eSafety Commissioner said. She said that, instead, the industry should write the rules.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We brought a piece of legislation to parliament on this very issue last year. It was widely supported across the parliament and was basically saying, 'Let's do what the eSafety Commissioner wants us to do and let's put in place a trial of age-assurance technology.' Pretty much everyone in this parliament, except the government, supported that because it's so simple, it's so sensible and it's clearly the right thing to do. But it's not just people in parliament who want this to happen. Australia's top experts on children's safety want this to happen as well. Tomorrow it will be six months since a group of experts wrote a very powerful letter to the minister asking her to act on the eSafety Commissioner's recommendation. They wrote that letter six months ago. What's happened in response? Nothing. They said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It is our strong view that the Government has allowed itself to be swayed by industry resistance to an age verification system. Vested interests should not have been put before the wellbeing of children.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those are very strong words. Who said those words? People, including Robert Fitzgerald, the former Commissioner of the Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse, did. People like Chanel Contos of Teach Us Consent signed the letter. People like Grace Tame, of the Grace Tame Foundation, signed the letter. People like Alison Geale, the CEO of Bravehearts and, of course, Melinda Tankard Reist, from Collective Shout, signed the letter. Fifty people signed this letter. What did the government do? Nothing. They've had the letter for six months.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just last month, the eSafety Commissioner was asked about this issue again at Senate estimates. What did she say? She said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">There are a range of technologies out there that are being used for the purposes of gambling and alcohol and can be used to protect children from pornography as well in a way that is privacy protective and enhancing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Even since we delivered the roadmap in March last year, we've seen even more maturation of the age-assurance industry. The technologies are getting better all the time. And then she said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The ecosystem is now mature enough that we could architect an age verification trial that would work. The technologies are evolving. The age-assurance industry is maturing. I think the time is right now that we all move forward.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The eSafety Commissioner, as she always does, was speaking in a very clear voice in the interests of keeping Australian children safe. But the minister—this hapless Minister for Communications—doesn't want to do it. There is no reason for that other than that the minister wants to support the industry over the interests of Australian children. hat is utterly wrong in every possible way one could look at this issue. It is a shameful decision of this government, fully supported by the Prime Minister. It needs to change, and the government needs to reverse its position and get moving on this issue.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">There were two key elements to a legislative or regulatory environment as put forward in that road map. One was establishing expectations and requirements for service providers to apply age assurance and other complementary measures, but also that there be established a regulatory scheme for the accreditation and oversight of age assurance providers to promote privacy, security, strong governance, transparency, trustworthiness and fairness. I want to add that, when you read this report, it's absolutely clear that the commissioner was recommending a holistic approach, reflecting that children access pornography and other inappropriate material in both intentional and non-intentional contexts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to put to the chamber that this is a very complex issue when it comes to actually implementing a measure that, if it were able to be implemented in a simple way, would provide protection. But there are a raft of considerations that need to be taken into account, and many of these were explicitly identified in the road map. Age assurance measures—and this is something directly referred to in the road map—have the potential to deter users from accessing compliant sites, which may lead to situations where they instead follow what you might call a path of least resistance and end up on high-risk sites. There are also a whole range of privacy, security and reliability issues.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For the sake of putting this issue in context, I will clarify terminology. Age assurance is what is generally referred to as what we are seeking here, which is a combination of two different approaches: age verification, which could potentially be achieved through physical or digital identification; or age estimation, which would be achieved through a range of techniques, including estimating the age of the person by using facial images, voice or any number of other techniques. That second set of processes has a range of accuracy, but, as the previous speaker identified, the accuracy of age estimation using certain techniques is increasing. But it is also the case that using certain age estimation techniques does raise privacy issues, which would need to be managed through a range of very strong governance procedures.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's important to note that the road map suggested a pilot for the reason that there are many issues that need to be managed as we move towards an age assurance system. Even the road map didn't say that we should immediately move towards a mandatory system. This is something that clearly needs to be piloted and worked through. The recommendations from the road map indicated that there should be funding of specialist researchers and that there should be a pilot—and that's exactly what the government is currently considering. The pilot is under consideration, and scoping work is currently being undertaken through a range of departments.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr WALLACE:</span>
                  </a>  It was a committee that decided unanimously to recommend that government introduce a system of age verification for online pornography, as did the former member for Dunkley and as did the current Deputy Speaker, the member for Macquarie. Labor members of the committee recommended that government introduce age verification for online pornography, because, Mr Deputy Speaker, you heard what I heard. We heard about innumerable instances and occasions of young women being assaulted by young men because of what they saw online through online pornography.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You can't go into a newsagent's and buy pornography when you are under 18. So why should you be able to access pornography on the internet when you are under 18? All we were asking is that the real world replicates the online world. Mr Deputy Speaker, you heard what I heard. You heard evidence of young women who'd had the most horrible things done to them because young men, in particular, have grown up with a fairly perverted concept of what a healthy sex life is, because of what they see in online pornography. You heard it. You agreed to it, Mr Deputy Speaker, as did all Labor members on that committee. Yet the minister comes in here and says: 'No, no, no; we shouldn't be doing this. Let the porn industry police themselves. Let them come up with a code of conduct.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We just listened to the previous speaker talk, quite frankly, rubbish. Those members opposite are suggesting that the perfect be the enemy of the good. But no system is perfect. No system designed by human beings is perfect. That doesn't mean you don't try to fix something that is clearly a societal problem. I was listening to a Michelle Grattan podcast this morning—<span style="font-style:italic;">Conversations</span>. Her most recent guest was again saying that pornography amongst young people, particularly young men, is having a very significant impact on the welfare of young women. And, quite frankly, it is not just young people. It is men my age who are watching pornography online and then trying to live out that false life in their real life, and it is having significant impacts on women—on domestic violence rates, on sexual assault rates. I cannot for the life of me understand why members opposite, including the minister, don't come in here and say: 'You know what? This bill that the member for Banks has put up is a good idea. Let's trial it.' The evidence is there. This is in place now in the United Kingdom, amongst other countries. What does it hurt to trial it? Do not let the perfect be the enemy of the good. It is common sense. I know members opposite think this is a good idea. You did. All the members on the committee did. Just try and get your minister to see sense and support this bill.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms SITOU</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Reid</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:20</span>):  I agree with the concern from the member for Fisher and the members who have spoken before. We in this place all want to ensure that children are kept safe from harm, particularly harm that they may experience online. This digital age is a new world for many of us. It's not a world that I grew up in or that I understand. So to think about my son growing up in this world and having all that awful content available to him at the touch of an iPad or online is quite scary. This is something that we're all grappling with, and I appreciate the concern of many in this chamber who've spoken already and the need for government to play a role. I think we all recognise that there's a role for us all to play, because respectful relationships need to be something on which we as a society come together to ensure that we are making people recognise that it is incumbent on all of us to play a role in teaching kids greater respect in relationships. The Albanese Labor government is committed to minimising the harm for children from accessing inappropriate content online.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to give the former government credit here because they established the eSafety Commissioner to provide an independent regulator to protect children online. It was the world's first government agency dedicated to keeping people safer online. We've increased the mandate of the commission to ensure that it protects not only kids but all Australians online. We've also quadrupled the regulator's ongoing base funding to ensure that they are funded into the future, and they are leading the charge in keeping Australians safe online. The eSafety Commissioner, Julie Inman Grant, told an international forum last year that they were able to remove a video showing a young Australian being beaten up at school from Instagram just 12 minutes after it was reported to eSafety. It was one of the quickest removals by the regulator and clearly demonstrates the important role they play in our society.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The <span style="font-style:italic;">Roadmap for age verification</span> report by the eSafety Commission examines the potential use of age verification and other strategies to shield children from the dangers of online pornography. It suggests steps such as funding research and education programs, raising awareness and testing age verification technologies before making them mandatory. Currently, a pilot program is being evaluated, with the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development, Communications and the Arts leading the charge to explore these options government-wide.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the same time, the government is also committed to implementing the Online Safety Act. The act mandates a more proactive role from the industry in protecting users, including the creation of industry codes. These codes specify measures to curb access and exposure to and storage of certain harmful online materials. The eSafety Commissioner has approved six industry codes aimed at combating illegal content. However, two codes, covering electronic services and designated internet services, were rejected by the regulator, leading to the development of mandatory standards. Again, this demonstrates the eSafety Commissioner's important role in working with industry to protect Australians online.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Safeguarding our kids online also means taking action offline. That is why we are working to ensure that children are educated about the importance of consent and respectful relationships. There is a role for all of us across the community to play to keep kids safe online. That's why I'm hosting a forum at Russell Lea Public School on Thursday 4 April at 6 pm for parents across my electorate. The federal Minister for Communications, Michelle Rowland, along with a representative from the eSafety Commissioner, will be there to share invaluable insights and practical tips for safeguarding our kids online. We'll be discussing cyberbullying, safer gaming online, understanding social media and protecting your child's privacy. I'd encourage all parents to RSVP for this event, because there's a role for us to play to protect our kids and minimise harm to kids online. </span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PEARCE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Braddon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:25</span>):  There's always a lot going on in this place. It's probably one of the things we do agree on. Today is one of those days where we need to take a pace back. We need to really consider what this means and the gravity at the base of this bill. We need to remind ourselves what's really important. For me, and for everyone on this side, the answer is clear cut: there is no greater purpose of this Australian government than keeping its Australian citizens safe and protecting those when they can't protect themselves. That's why the Liberal-National coalition has always put national safety at the forefront of our policymaking agenda. We stand firm against entities, whether they be foreign businesses or individuals, that seek to harm us and harm our children. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why I'm standing here today. I'm standing up to condemn this government for refusing to take every single measure available to them to keep our children, our next generation, safe from online pornography and the range of negative consequences that comes from accessing that pornography. These negative effects include, but are certainly not limited to, lowering kids' self-esteem, body dissatisfaction, greater acceptance of sexual aggression, normalisation of violence against women and the alarming rise of child-on-child sexual abuse. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I just don't understand Labor's position on this. I can't fathom it. Those opposite think altering the self-regulatory porn industry codes will fix the problem. That's what they think. It beggars belief. What we must be investigating right now is the mechanism to prevent access to the source. We need to be cutting the head off the snake. Statistics around the world about children accessing pornography are confronting. Almost half of Australian children aged between the ages of nine and 16 experience regular exposure to sexual images. Over 80 per cent of young men aged 14 to 17 have been exposed to online pornography. A third of these first saw pornography before the age of 13. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This was an issue that the former Liberal-National government was tackling head on. We commissioned the parliamentary inquiries in 2016 and 2019. The 2019 inquiry specifically looked at using age verification to prevent children accessing online wagering and online pornography sites. For those who don't know or understand what that is, age verification is a process that confirms the person accessing an online site is the age that they claim to be, and if you can't confirm that age then you are blocked from utilising that site. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Key recommendations of the 2019 inquiry included that the eSafety Commissioner be funded to undertake a trial of age verification for online pornography. It was a recommendation to government that had almost universal support. More than three in four adults surveyed during the inquiry supported the implementation of age-assurance technology. The nation's leading child and women's safety advocates supported the trial, and of course the Liberal-National coalition supported the trial. We stood behind it. The two most significant stakeholders that don't support the trial are the pornography industry and this Labor government. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a national safety issue, and we now should be investigating all options, every single one, in order to ensure our most vulnerable kids are protected. Unfortunately, our children's safety is not this Labor government's priority. Instead, they've turned their backs on our kids, on our children, on our safety advocates and on their own eSafety Commissioner. They've turned their backs to the side and their one ally, the pornography industry. Rightly so, child safety advocates have been swift in their condemnation of this government. Fifty leading advocates have written to the minister, urging the government to reconsider the decision and to reject the trial. The group, called Collective Shout, said the Labor government has prioritised pornography profits over the protection of our children. Why has this federal government put the vested interests of the global predatory porn industry over the wellbeing and safety of our kids? It's shameful, and I call on Minister Rowland to reverse this bad decision and to listen to her eSafety Commissioner and protect Australian kids.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Corangamite</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:30</span>):  No Australian wants children accessing pornography online. No Australian accepts the exploitation or abuse of children online, and no parent wants to deal with such online abuse. Parents across our nation are grappling with the challenges of the online environment. Many feel disempowered and look to government to step up, and the Albanese government and our minister for communications are doing so. We are supporting recommendations for the eSafety Commissioner to develop a roadmap for age verification. Released in March last year, the roadmap investigated how age verification and other measures could be used to prevent and mitigate harm to children from online pornography. It also made a number of recommendations, including that the government invest in research, education, awareness and resources, and pilot age-assurance technologies before mandating them. A pilot is now under consideration, and the department of communications is currently scoping this work across government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The roadmap also highlights the importance of respectful relationship education in online safety, sexuality and consent. These are integral in addressing the harms associated with online pornography. The government is delivering on these by providing: $83.5 million over six years to support the delivery of age-appropriate, evidence-based and expert-developed respectful relationships education aligned to the Australian curriculum; $39.9 million under the National Plan to End Violence against Women and Children 2022-32 to develop a prevention campaign on consent and respectful relationships; and $100 million over five years to support Our Watch to deliver on priorities of the national plan and continue successful initiatives for the primary prevention of violence against women and children. Finally, $23.3 million is being provided over five years for the ANROWS national priority research fund, which will continue to build the evidence base that supports ending violence against women and children in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government is also committed to completing the implementation of the Online Safety Act and the powers it provides to the eSafety Commissioner to develop new mandatory industry codes to protect children from online pornography. These codes will apply to all different sections of the digital industry, including pornography websites, app stores and internet service providers, as well as sites where children unintentionally come across pornography, like social media and gaming sites. Under the law, if the codes do not provide appropriate safeguards, the eSafety Commissioner can reject them and move to enforceable standards. Industry also faces penalties for noncompliance. The kinds of measures that could be incorporated into the new codes, based on advice from eSafety, include a clear minimum age to use the service, an enforcement of that through age-assurance mechanisms, proactive content detection, and moderation technology. The government is also closely monitoring international and industry developments and in February this year co-signed a historic online safety and security memorandum of understanding with the United Kingdom, committing to closer cooperation to tackle online harms. This will ensure that both countries can learn from each other as we address the challenges of preventing children from being exposed to harmful material online.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government is committed to supporting e-safety and to improving online safety for Australians, particularly young and vulnerable Australians. To this end, the 2023-24 federal budget quadrupled ongoing funding to the e-safety regulator. This important contribution will rectify underfunding by the previous coalition government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We acknowledge that parents, carers and other members of the community who care for children may feel overwhelmed by this issue. Please be assured that advice and supports are available through the e-safety website. I encourage everyone in my region to access these resources. As a member of the federal government, I want you to know that I'm always there for you if you need to reach out. To that end, I'll soon be holding a forum in my electorate on keeping kids safe. I'll keep you up to date. We must all, in this place, strive to stamp out online abuse.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Forrest</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:35</span>):  I certainly support the motion by the member for Banks and wholeheartedly agree that everybody in this House should be doing everything they can to keep our kids safe. While the government is going through this process, we could have—and should have—already had a trial in place in the way that the member for Banks has articulated.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Having given hundreds of cybersafety presentations to schoolkids since being in this place—hundreds—I can speak with a lot of authority on what the kids are dealing with, which is why I so strongly support this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A two-year trial wouldn't have been much to ask for, as the eSafety Commissioner did. Every day, more and more kids are being affected by this, by their accessing of pornography and what it does to them and their lives. The eSafety Commissioner said there are already age-assurance technologies that can be used right now to help protect children from online harm. That's what the government should have done immediately—not waiting, not giving the porn industry even more opportunity to get to our children. That is not okay. It is not okay.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, the government has said no to this trial. When looking at this, the eSafety Commissioner, an office that we set up in government, titled this 'A matter of principle: guiding the age verification roadmap.' That is what this discussion is about today: the age verification; the matter of principle. It is not okay for the government to wait. You don't wait when you're talking about kids being safe online.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I talked to one group of kids in my electorate who came to me to tell me they were desperately concerned. They were 15- and 16-year-olds, and they had nine-year-olds that they knew were watching live streaming of sex acts online. Why is that okay? Why isn't age verification important in that space?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Equally, in my time of dealing with the issues that the young people have talked to me repeatedly about in those hundreds of cybersafety presentations, what about the GPs who've had to deal with the internal damage that young women have experienced because their first experience learning about sex was from a pornography site by a young man? Why is it okay for that to continue? It is not, because pornography, particularly that which depicts violence, has direct harm, and it has mental harm as well as physical harm, as I've just said.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The majority of parents indicate that children as young as four are using the internet. Look at what they would have access to. It only takes the wrong words typed in, and guess what they can come up with right now?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Educators are now reporting, as the eSafety Commissioner has said, that young children from year 1, aged six and seven, are viewing, sharing and discussing pornography at school. Why wouldn't the government be doing everything it could, even with a trial, to start to try to address this? It is not okay in anyone's language—ever. This is and should be an ongoing issue for all of us, and I take this very seriously and personally with the amount of effort that I have put in to try to help to keep our kids safe.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">From eSafety's own research, three-quarters of 16- to 18-year-olds have viewed it at some stage, and most of that is before the age of 16. It is violent and it shows a lack of respect, consent or agency, particularly for women and less dominant partners. This affects young people all the way through their lives, and it isn't okay for any child to access pornography in this way. It scares them so much. The younger they are the more damage it does to them when they access it, and often they won't talk about it with anyone because they know that they've done something wrong, they're scared and they're worried. I say to them: 'Please find your trusted adult, the person you can talk to, no matter what happens to you online, even if you've done something you think you shouldn't or if you're scared, worried or upset. Having that trusted adult that you can talk to is always going to help you.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But I just wonder, while we wait for what the government is trying to do here, how many more kids are going to be affected by this? Every one is one too many, and that's how I've approached what I've done in my own electorate. Every one child matters, and every one child I can help keep safe online I will. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Higgins</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:40</span>):  We are all in furious agreement in this House that we want our kids to be kept safe, whether that be online or in the physical world. Unfortunately, social media—bearing in mind that Meta turns 20 this year—has I think been overall a net negative. It has resulted in the fracking of our attention—not only our children's but ours. It has driven polarisation, it has spread misinformation and disinformation around the world and it has in fact threatened the foundations of our democracy. To add to that litany of harms, now we have the problems associated with highly porous online porn sites.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Online porn is harmful because it affects and shapes attitudes which then go on to impact behaviours. It's largely created for a male, heterosexual audience, which then leads to harmful depictions of sexuality, leading to sexism and misogyny and, indeed, it has been linked to gender-based violence. The statistics are alarming, and these come from the roadmap that was released in March 2023. Three-quarters of 16- to 18-year-olds have seen online porn, and of these a third were exposed before the age of 13 and nearly half saw it between the ages of 13 and 15.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">However, the issue is: where are they actually consuming this material? As it turns out, 70 per cent of the material is consumed on porn sites, as you would imagine; however, that means that 30 per cent isn't. That 30 per cent encompasses social media sites, group chats and private group pages—for example, pages like Discord. So when they talk about initiating or piloting age-assurance mechanisms I think the coalition are talking specifically about porn sites, but you would then create a whack-a-mole problem where you may inadvertently drive audiences, including children, to these other sites: social media, Discord, group chats and private pages. You would also then drive the content to those sites. What is actually needed here, rather than a reflexive action, is a holistic approach to keeping children safe online, and that is certainly something that we, as a government, are looking at.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Age-assurance technologies is an umbrella term that encompasses age verification, which has a very high accuracy, as well as age estimation, which relies on things like biometrics of the face or analysis of the voice—which is fine if you have a voice that's not affected, for example, by an unusual accent or fluency problems. There are other ways of assessing age that may rely on tests of capacity or cognition—similar to the tests that I used to use as a medical practitioner—and then there are harder identifiers requiring documents, which is fine if you actually have those documents at hand.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's been some interesting work looking at age tokens, whereby an age is verified but the provider is blinded to it. This token is held on a device—for example, in a secure wallet—and then used for a period of time so that personal details are not shared every time a person wants to access content. The important thing here is that there are a lot of technologies out there that have been trialled, but they aren't mature; they're still evolving. We're not going to rush in. We're doing some scoping work as to which one of these is best to deploy, and it may well be, based on the advice that has come from the eSafety Commissioner, that we will have to use a variety of options because that is in fact what consumers want.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Children are going onto these sites for lots of reasons. Obviously we want to protect them, but we also want to make sure we have tools that are effective and that don't inadvertently drive traffic to more porous sites, shall we say. In terms of a holistic approach, it's not enough to target age gating; we also have to educate people on respectful relationships, which is what we're doing, in order to create that counternarrative to the harmful norms that are being perpetrated in online porn.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Casey</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:46</span>):  I commend the member for Forrest, who is still in the House, for her advocacy and her whole career in this space of keeping children safe online. She spoke so well and so eloquently before. She has been a fierce advocate; I've seen that in the 18 to 20 months I've been here. It's wonderful to see the member take any chance to talk about the importance of this space. I commend her for her lifelong advocacy; it has an impact on all of us. I also commend the member for Banks not only for bringing this motion but for his private member's bill.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've heard those opposite talk about the importance of online safety. They recognise that, but when there was an opportunity to do something they didn't take that opportunity. It shows, ultimately, the hypocrisy of this Prime Minister and this government. Day after day in this House, particularly in question time and in the media, we hear the government criticise our side of parliament for being negative, for saying no, for not working with them. Here we had an opportunity for bipartisan support to keep children safe—a recommendation from the eSafety Commissioner for the mandated trial of age assurances—and this government said no. They said they were not prepared to work with us to keep children safe online.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sometimes we can get into the technical weeds of talking about age assurance and different technologies, so let's take a step back and understand what we're talking about here. Let's use an example of if this technology was in the real world. Essentially the government is saying that if you've got three shops on a strip—a TAB, a pub and an adult store selling pornography—and if a 12-year-old child tries to walk into the TAB they'll get denied entry and be told, 'No, you're 12. You're too young. You can't come in,' and if they then go next door and try and walk into the pub, without their parents, to order a beer, they'll get told, 'No, you cannot buy alcohol in this store,' but if they go to the third store, the adult shop, and say, 'I would like to buy a DVD of pornography,' the owner will say, 'Yes, no problems,' and hand it over—no issue at all. That is the reality of what we were talking about with that bill, and what the coalition was trying to stop and what those opposite voted against—protecting children from accessing pornography. That's what happens in the real world: if you, as a 12-year-old, walk into that shop in any town and any community across this country you get stopped from going into that store—but online you're not able to be. If you try to buy alcohol or if you try to put a bet on, you get stopped by the age verification technology.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're hearing things about needing to do reviews and understand. This is one of the classic examples I talked about in my first speech: as we get more technologically advanced, the pace of regulation doesn't keep up. But the technology exists. It exists in gambling. It exists with online liquor. The eSafety Commissioner herself confirmed it existed. So we'll hear those opposite talk about needing to do reviews and about comprehensive approaches, absolutely. But this is a trial for two years to save children, and we should start it straight away. As the member for Forrest said, if this can save one child from going through the trauma of online pornography and inappropriate content, surely it is worth starting the trial, to see if it will make a difference. If we wait one, two or three years for a comprehensive review, guess what? We'll probably want to start this trial anyway. There's no justification for ignoring the evidence of the eSafety Commissioner.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This was an opportunity for bipartisan support, so I commend the member for Banks for his leadership in this space, bringing this motion on and also bringing forward the private member's bill. It is vital that we do everything we can in this House to protect children. The dangers and damage of online pornography to young children, particularly young men, have been articulated, and what that does when they take it to the real world.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr DAVID SMITH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bean</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:51</span>):  The internet has provided many transformative positives for our society, but it's also brought ethical dilemmas on how we can regulate it and its impacts. Arguably, the failure to do so in the early years of the web have left us, at times, trying to retrofit and play catch-up.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Most people do not dispute that the internet should be free and open to all so all can explore ideas and communicate across distance and cultures. At the same time, there are few who would advocate that the internet should be a place of perfect freedom, a place where criminals should be free to exploit citizens. Most consider, as philosopher John Locke did, that there is a role for government in protecting the natural rights of citizens. In the case of the internet, that includes combatting internet criminals and protecting vulnerable citizens from exploitation and undesirable online contacts and content. We must ensure that the parliament remains united in its mission to minimise the harm that comes from children accessing content online that's not appropriate for them. The Albanese government is committed to doing this and is particularly concerned with the negative impact that exposure to online pornography can have on children and young people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 31 March 2023, the eSafety Commissioner delivered the roadmap for age verification to the government. The roadmap explores if and how age verification and other measures could be used to prevent and mitigate harm to children from online pornography. The roadmap made a number of recommendations, including that the government invests in research, education, awareness and resources and pilots age-assurance technologies before seeking to mandate them. A pilot is now under consideration, and the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development, Communications and the Arts is currently scoping this work across government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government is also committed to completing the implementation of the Online Safety Act—importantly, the powers it provides the eSafety Commissioner to develop new mandatory industry codes to protect children from online pornography. These codes will apply to all different sections of the digital industry. Under the law, if the codes do not provide appropriate safeguards, the eSafety Commissioner can reject them and move to enforceable standards. Industry also faces penalties for noncompliance. The kinds of measures that could be incorporated, per advice from the eSafety Commissioner, include a clear minimum age to use the service and enforcement of that through age-assurance mechanisms, among other measures, such as proactive content detection and moderation technology.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The roadmap calls out the importance of respectful relationships education, and the related topics of online safety, sexuality and consent are integral to addressing the harms associated with online pornography. The government is delivering on these by providing: $83.5 million over six years to support the delivery of age appropriate, evidence based and expert developed respectful relationships education aligned with the Australian curriculum; just under $40 million under the National Plan to End Violence against Women and Children 2022-2032 to develop a prevention campaign on consent and respectful relationships; and just over $100 million over five years to support Our Watch to deliver on its priorities in the national plan and to continue successful initiatives for the primary prevention of violence against women and children. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We acknowledge that parents, carers and other members of the community who care for children may feel overwhelmed by this issue. Advice and support are available. eSafety has published a range of practical online resources with easy-to-follow advice about how technology and parental control settings can prevent children from accessing online pornography. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Education is not a quick solution but it is essential and highly effective. It will play a crucial role in protecting current and future generations. In addition, this government has brought forward the independent statutory review of the Online Safety Act, which will be completed in this term of government. With the online environment constantly changing, an early review will ensure that Australia's legislative framework remains responsive to online harms and that the eSafety Commissioner can continue to keep Australians safe from harm. The Albanese government is committed to ensuring that Australia has world-leading online safety laws that allow Australians to harness the potential of the digital environment while also keeping them safe online. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="72184" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr GILLESPIE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyne</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:56</span>):  Online safety for children is probably one of the most pressing immediate problems in this digital world now. We have all heard stories about the epidemic of childhood anxiety and concerns, and about the abuse of children. It is endemic. Unfortunately, most of the causes of the anxiety are happening online; that's where trolls, colleagues and peers of teenagers are abusing them. But there are people based in Nigeria, and around the world, that present themselves as people they're not. Often they're male, they're part of a gangster organisation and they're presenting as a cute teenage girl. And they entrap young boys and men. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Age verification software is part of trying to fix that problem. There are varying permutations of online child abuse. Having a roadmap for age verification seems like an eminently suitable initiative. Yet the minister is not following the advice of her own eSafety Commissioner. The government has refused to support the eSafety Commissioner's recommendation and instead has backed the development of industry codes as a stop-gap measure. Industry codes sound good in practice, but these online platforms are a rule and a law unto themselves. They would laugh at a roadmap. You've just got to see what they've done so far; for example, Meta have now refused to pay for all the media that they put on their platforms for free. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's really counterproductive to not follow this advisory roadmap, which was discussed during Senate estimates. There is a range of software and apps that are ready to roll to do this. But we need to mandate it. We need to make it a regulation, not just a so-called advisory, if we are going to address the problem of young people being so distressed that they actually commit self-harm, up to and including suicide. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The digital world is with us and it's with our children and young people now. We really need to follow this train of practice, not just talk about it. We on this side are calling on the minister to reverse her position on an age verification mandate. Even if you're not going to do it, at least start a trial so you yourself can see it will be beneficial. The urgency of this is paramount. Every time I go home, throughout my time in parliament, telecommunications and IT issues always turn out to be one of the more common things. Amongst that IT-and-digital-world set of problems, this is palpable. Parents are worried about it. I'm worried about it. Many people on that side, on the minister's side, of this House are worried about it. It's not going to cost a fortune. It's going to be easy to implement. I just commend an age-verification process to be started as soon as possible.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will say a few words, just explaining in more ordinary human terms the procedural motion that I just read out. Members will be aware that the funeral of Lance Corporal Jack Fitzgibbon is happening today. Members, both government and opposition, are attending the funeral, and, for that reason, we have wanted to change the time of question time today. So question time doesn't start until 3.30 pm, and, as a result of that, the 90-second statements will start at 3 pm. All the other changes for today, in the Federation Chamber and other, are consequent on the shift of question time for that reason.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The second change is something that goes to Thursday's sitting for next week. It's one of those issues where the different perspectives of people from all around the country can lead to different conclusions. For me, as someone who gets into my car, drives on the M5 and is home back at Punchbowl within three hours at the end of a parliamentary sitting week, the concept of us sitting on Holy Thursday, the day before Good Friday, made no difference to my being able to attend particular events and services on Good Friday. It's a completely different world for regional members, and I want to acknowledge the regional members. Out of respect, I will say this challenge with what that Thursday sitting would mean was first raised with me by some very senior members of the opposition. Conversations have taken place between the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition. While I may be in the minority in this House, I'd love it if we sat every day. That's how I feel about the chamber. But this does avoid a problem that was going to put some members, particularly regional members, in an impossible position with what the sitting week was like for next week. So I thank those members from the opposition, the crossbench and my own caucus who've raised this with me.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So the two changes, in summary, are that, firstly, question time today is not till 3.30 and 90-second statements will start at three, and, secondly, the Thursday sitting which had been scheduled for next week would not occur should this motion be agreed to by the House.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This parliament must stop backing the invasion of Gaza. Labor must stop backing the invasion of Gaza. As we meet today, over 31,000 people in Gaza, mainly civilians, have been killed. That includes over 13,000 children. Thirteen thousand children have been killed since the Labor backed invasion of Gaza began. Estimates are that between one and two million people have been displaced out of a population of 2.2 million. Half of the homes in Gaza have been destroyed, meaning there is nowhere for people to go, and, of course, the borders remain shut so people cannot get out. Children are now starving. They are dehydrating. Women are giving birth without any kind of painkillers or other assistance. The health system is on the brink of collapse and, in parts of Gaza, has collapsed. A hundred thousand people plus are dead, wounded or missing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since this parliament met and Labor and the Liberals backed the invasion, the population of Gaza have been herded south. They were told to move south by the Israeli military because they were told that the north was going to be bombed, and it has been bombed. It has been levelled. Now there are reports that the military is building a road from east to west to further partition Gaza in the way that it has done with parts of the West Bank, and there is nothing in the north for people to go back to. They've been herded into what has been described as the world's largest refugee camp, in Rafah, where there are over 1½ million people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, since the Greens last tried to reverse Labor's support for this invasion, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu has said they are going to invade Rafah. Even as others offer plaintive pleas to please not do it, from people including our Prime Minister and the United States President, nonetheless Prime Minister Netanyahu comes out again and again and says: 'We're going to do it. We're going to keep doing it.' It is crystal clear now that this invasion that Labor continues to back is not only a humanitarian catastrophe but a war crime that is resulting in the mass slaughter of tens of thousands of children and civilians, and it is getting worse.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is not just the unbelievably catastrophic death toll, which is a result of this invasion that everyone could see coming, but also the utter collapse of civil society and the health system within Gaza, which is leading to aid agencies warning of widespread famine and disease that is about to hit. They are telling us and everyone around the world that they cannot get the aid in that is needed. They cannot get it in, because it is being blockaded by the Israeli military and the Israeli government at the borders. Since we were last here in parliament, we have witnessed people who were lining up to get flour and the basics of life get killed when the Israeli military opened fire. They have been killed as they lined up to get the most basic items of life. Children in Gaza are now eating so-called 'bread' made out of animal food. Mothers are fronting up to seek medical help with children dying in their arms because they are not getting enough to eat. And aid is getting stalled at the border as part of this invasion. The Israeli government, which Labor continues to back, is not even letting aid in.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When this issue first came before parliament, we said very clearly, 'You cannot back the invasion of 2.2 million people walled into an area half the size of the ACT—where 40 per cent of them are under the age of 15—without a humanitarian catastrophe and mass slaughter unfolding.' Tragically, what we said back in October is now happening day after day, and it is getting worse. This extreme right-wing war cabinet that Prime Minister Netanyahu has set up is not listening to the plaintive pleas and weasel words of governments like Australia, especially when the Labor government keeps backing military exports to Israel and refuses to join the majority of the world's countries in calling for a permanent and immediate ceasefire—not some humanitarian pause that means the Gazans can be fed before they get shot at again, but a full, immediate and permanent ceasefire. That is now what a majority of the Australian people want.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we have seen is that the pressure from the Australian people is working. It has meant that the government has reversed its shameful decision to cut funding to UNRWA, the body that is delivering aid to people. Our Labor government shamefully cut their funding, and public pressure has reversed that decision that never should have been taken in the first place. It is time now to listen to what the people of this country and people right around the world are saying. It is time to call for an immediate and permanent ceasefire and to stop backing the invasion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last time this debate happened, we saw some utter furphies and red herrings put up by the government and others. They said, 'Well, you can't support this motion because it doesn't mention the hostages and it doesn't mention the other attacks on civilians that happened on 7 October.' Let's be crystal clear about this: this parliament has already made its view clear about that. There is unanimous agreement to call for the immediate release of the hostages, and there has been unanimous condemnation of attacks on civilians. Everyone has done that. That is not a reason not to vote for this motion, because that will stand on the parliament's record and enjoy the unanimous support of people here.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What this motion is about is one thing and one thing only: knowing that over 30,000 people have been killed and 100,000 people have been killed, are missing or are injured, whether you still continue to back the invasion of Gaza. That is what this motion is about, and this is a moment for everyone in this parliament, knowing what has unfolded since 7 October and seeing the devastating toll it is taking on civilians, to decide whether you still back the invasion or not. Even if you have a different view to what I do and to what the Greens do about this being the time to start putting sanctions on this extreme war cabinet of Prime Minister Netanyahu's and to stop arming Israel, even if you have different views about those things and even if you think the invasion was justified back then, there is no justification for continuing to back the slaughter of thousands of people who are walled in to an area half the size of Canberra with nowhere to go.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When Prime Minister Netanyahu says, 'I'm going to invade Rafah no matter what you say,' now is the time to say, unequivocally, 'We're going to stop backing the invasion.' This is the time for every member of parliament to make their vote count. Everyone in this country will be watching. Which members of parliament have the courage to line up and say, 'It is time to stop the invasion, and it is time for a full, permanent and immediate ceasefire'?</span>

                  <a href="300121" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr CHANDLER-MATHER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Griffith</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:16</span>):  I second the motion. What will it take for this Labor government to drop its support for Israel? What will it take for this Labor government to drop its support for the disastrous and genocidal invasion of Gaza? What will it take for Australia to start standing up to the United States and Israel and actually take actions to stop the genocide unfolding in Gaza? Apparently, over 31,000 Palestinians being murdered in Gaza is not enough. Apparently, Israel bombing Palestinian schools, hospitals, homes and bakeries isn't enough. Apparently, Israel deliberately—and this is key; this is not some natural phenomenon—engineering a famine that may well end up killing hundreds of thousands of Palestinians is not enough for this Labor government to drop its support for the invasion of Gaza and drop its support for the State of Israel.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So there have been no sanctions or actions to stop Israel's genocide. In fact, all Labor has done is support Israel by allowing weapons to be exported to the country and refuse to even support South Africa's ICJ case at the International Court of Justice. What this government has done while there is an engineered famine in Gaza is suspend and cut aid funding for 48 days to Palestine. That's what they did—no sanctions for Israel but sanctions for Palestinians. That is truly remarkable. This was in a period, by the way, when the International Court of Justice found there was a plausible case for genocide in Gaza, and what did this Labor government do? It stopped aid funding to Palestinians. By the way, 80 per cent of all the world's critical famine is in Gaza. That's what the Labor government did. Not only that but they temporarily suspended the visas of Palestinians fleeing this conflict and this genocide. But apparently there are no sanctions for Israel.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know about the critical famine. This parliament knows—everyone in this parliament knows—of the 31,000 people murdered, 13,000 of whom are children. Sometimes these numbers are hard to comprehend. The horror of it is hard to comprehend. But, to give some perspective on just how horrific this is, the average number of kids in an Australian school is 420. That means that 30 schools worth of Palestinian children have been killed. Think about the futures that these kids could have had—the loves, the relationships and the connections to their parents—all snuffed out.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This parliament can't even bring itself to oppose the invasion of Gaza and the genocide happening right now in Gaza, being carried out by the State of Israel with, by the way, weapons manufactured in Australia and exported to Israel. The UNICEF chief has said, and the headline is, 'Gaza babies "don't even have the energy to cry"'. There is an effort in this parliament, right now, from the major parties to turn away from this horror, to try to pretend like it's not happening and there's nothing you can do. But you know full well that if this parliament was able to take sanctions on Russia justifiably then we can take sanctions against Israel. In future generations, we'll ask every parliamentarian in this House, 'What did you do when this was happening?'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's talk about what's happening. This is from the article: one in three babies under the age of two in northern Gaza are suffering from acute malnutrition according to UNICEF. Catherine Russell, the executive director of the UN's children agency described with US broadcaster CBS:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">…essentially, the body starts to consume itself because it has nothing else and it's a painful, painful death for children. I've been in wards of children who are suffering from … malnutrition, the whole ward is … quiet…the babies have don't even have the energy to cry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is what's happening right now in Gaza. There are babies and children in the arms of their parents, if they haven't already been killed by the State of Israel, who are dying slow, quiet, painful deaths. Do not pretend like you don't know this isn't happening. In 10, 20, 30 years time, every member of this House will have to ask themselves, 'What was every member of this parliament doing?' What did you do? And don't turn around and think you can lie to people in the future and say, 'We were doing everything that we could.' We know that you weren't, and the Australian public knows that as well. Think about that for a moment. We need a permanent and immediate ceasefire, a ban of weapons sales to Israel, and to join South Africa's case at the ICJ. That's the bare minimum when such a horror is taking place on our watch.</span>

                  </a>  It doesn't matter. I believe every life is sacred. But on 7 October we saw the most despicable, violent attack against innocent civilians in southern Israel. We saw 1,200 deaths of Jewish people. Hamas terrorists flew, tunnelled under, smashed through fences to rape, to torture, to kill and to take hostages because of the race of people living in Israel—and it has to be said they weren't just Jews that Hamas killed and raped and tortured. There were 1,200 deaths. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 7 October, 14,492 people were injured. I'll say that number again, because it's not one that's used very often. You don't hear about it very often: 14,492. According to the National Insurance Institute report, 52,571 people were injured as a result after 7 October. Two hundred and sixty four hostages were taken and 134 hostages remain. The Greens don't talk about that. The Greens don't talk about the atrocities that took place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I travelled to Israel in December of last year. I was briefed. It is seared into my brain: a 42-minute video where I saw over 100 Jews slaughtered at the hands of Hamas terrorists. I saw the body cam of those deaths and the appalling attacks on children and women. Israel did not want this war. They did not start this war. Hamas terrorists knew what they were doing on 7 October. It would be like me walking up to a beehive and shaking the beehive and not expecting to be attacked. Hamas knew exactly what they were doing. This was a strategy many months, if not years, in the planning. They knew what they were doing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I watched that video, as the deputy chair of the Intelligence and Security Committee, I think it was a life changing moment for me. We saw videos of terrorists trying to behead innocent Israeli civilians. Where were the Greens talking about this? Where were the Greens talking about the rape of women and children? Where were they? You don't hear the Greens talking about those atrocities. They made one reference, today, to 7 October—one reference out of 15 minutes of speeches. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This war could end today if Hamas unconditionally surrendered and handed back the 134 hostages. Prime Minister Netanyahu has said that very thing. This war could end. But Hamas don't want to do that. Since 7 October, and for years prior to that, they have used infrastructure in Gaza as a means to protect their own terrorists. They have used Palestinians as human shields. They've used hospitals and schools. There is no doubt about that. It is irrefutable that Hamas are using Palestinian civilians as human shields. And they are doing that because they know that they will garner support from the international community. The reality is that, under international law, Israel has a right to defend itself.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just after 7 October, only about a week after 7 October, we saw a Hamas leader come out and say, 'Hamas will continue to attack Israel.' They will continue and continue and continue until Israel and everybody in it is driven into the sea. 'From the river to the sea, Palestine will be free'; that is their catch phrase. That's what they say. Hamas have continually threatened the annihilation of Israel and everybody living in it. When you have that existential threat, what is a government to do? What would we do as the government of Australia if we were put in that same situation? I have been on the ground. I have seen the sites of the atrocities. I have been on the ground and I've talked to family members. I've talked to people who have lost loved ones. From everybody I have spoken to on the streets in Israel, they are in a state of national grief. Everybody knows someone who has lost someone, or who knows a hostage or who has a family member who has been or is a hostage.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Israel is a small country of only nine million people, and the state of grief in Israel is palpable. I would encourage those members of the Greens political party to visit Israel and see the pain that has been caused as a result of the atrocities that occurred on 7 October. But they won't. They don't want to do it. They don't want to talk about the appalling, atrocious attacks. They don't want to talk about the innocent lives lost in Israel, starting on 7 October. Why won't they talk about what started this war? </span>

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is aimed to strengthen Australia's existing legislative provisions to control and prevent the export and transfer of sensitive Defence information to foreign militaries. It achieves this by creating an authorisation framework that regulates work performed by former Defence staff members—including both former ADF members and Defence Australian Public Service employees.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will also apply to all Australian citizens or permanent residents seeking to provide training to foreign militaries or foreign government entities in relation to goods, software and technologies in part 1 of the Defence and Strategic Goods List or training in relation to military tactics, techniques and procedures.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As part of its evidence to the committee, Defence provided the committee with a number of case studies that stated:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill is an important step towards ensuring foreign actors cannot collect Defence secrets through the employment of former Defence personnel, or Australians with knowledge of and access to sensitive technology and military information.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Defence informed the committee that the bill complemented the Defence Trade Controls Amendment Bill to further strengthen Australia's export control framework by enhancing the protections around the supply of controlled goods and technology within and outside of Australia. The SAMS bill, as it's known in the acronym, also supports the export licence free environment between AUKUS partners, unlocking defence trade, innovation and collaboration. Together with the Defence Trade Controls Amendment Bill, the safeguarding Australia's military secrets bill—the SAMS bill—will meet the requirement to implement a standard of controls comparable to those of the United States to access the national exemption from US export control licensing requirements of the US Arms Export Control Act.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Hostile foreign states and their intelligence services are aggressively seeking secrets about Australia's defence capabilities, government decision-making, political parties, foreign policy, critical infrastructure, space technologies, academic and think tank research, medical advances, key export industries and personal information.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">if necessary. Once passed, this bill will deal with the potential for former Defence staff members to reveal sensitive defence information and place Australia's national security at risk. In addition, it will provide our allies with more confidence that securing sensitive military information is at the forefront of the Australian government's national security thinking and practice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On behalf of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, I extend my thanks to those who participated in the inquiry by providing submissions and appearing at public hearings. I thank my colleagues, including the deputy chair, and all the members of the committee for their work on this report. It's extremely sensitive and extremely important, and the committee worked around the clock, given the time sensitivities and time constraints we were facing with respect to the need to introduce this bill to the parliament before the April recess. I extend my thanks to all committee members for their fine and hard work on this, and to the secretariat staff, who always work so hard and diligently under extreme circumstances—particularly with the PJCIS, with so many reports; there are some 14 inquiries we've got underway at the same time. There's an enormous amount of pressure on the secretariat as well as the committee members. I am very grateful for their efforts, and I thank them. I commend this report to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fisher</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:47</span>):  by leave—I echo the remarks of the chair of the committee. The committee does very important work, and, as the chair indicated, it has an extremely high workload—one that I've not experienced in my eight years in this place. Without giving the chair too much support, I will say that he does a reasonable job in that position; it's a very trying job. This report is really important. I don't often rise as the deputy chair when there are matters of agreement on these reports, but I want to make some comments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is incredibly important that we have a regime, like what will ultimately become the SAMS act, that protects intellectual property and the knowledge men and women have gained of tactics, procedure and methods whilst they've been in the ADF. When they discharge, those tactics, methods and procedures could be used against this country by a foreign adversary. It's very important that this bill, when it comes before the parliament—which is very shortly: today, I believe—is passed at least this week. I encourage the Department of Defence, who will be charged with the responsibility of ensuring as best they can that private industry is not adversely impacted—it's very important, particularly at the moment, when defence industry in this country is doing it very tough—to ensure that the defence industry is not bound up with unnecessary regulatory red tape. I'm not suggesting that the SAMS bill will provide unnecessary red tape, but it's really important that companies, businesses and individuals do not get unnecessarily delayed in their applications to the department. It is incredibly important, at a difficult time when we have cost-of-living pressures on every Australian, but particularly the defence industry. We need to be relying on defence industry in this country like no other time since 1945. We live in the most geopolitically, geostrategically difficult time since 1945. We need to be working government and industry hand in glove, so I implore the Department of Defence to do everything they can to ensure that applications by individuals are treated as expeditiously as humanly possible.</span>

                  <a href="248181" type="MemberContinuation">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Ms CLAYDON:</span>
                  </a>  I'm delighted to present the report of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation to the 66th Commonwealth Parliamentary Association Conference held in Accra, Ghana from 1 to 5 October 2023. The delegation was led by the President of the Senate, accompanied by the member for McPherson and me. The delegation worked effectively, alongside other Australian delegates to the CPA conference from the states and territories, to advance our region's interests during the conference. In addition to the annual general assembly of the CPA, the conference included meetings of regional groups of the CPA, the Commonwealth Women Parliamentarians and the Commonwealth Parliamentarians with Disabilities network. Also held were the 39th CPA Small Branches Conference, with members from small legislators, as well as meetings of the CPA executive committee.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The theme of the 2023 conference was: The Commonwealth Charter 10 Years On: Values and Principles for Parliaments to Uphold. There were eight workshops conducted that explored this theme from all different perspectives. The President of the Senate was a panellist on the workshop considering the Latimer House principles on the separation of powers, while I was the speaker and a panel member on a youth roundtable workshop on the role of the Commonwealth in international security, peacekeeping and peace-building arrangements.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The conference's concluding statement, which is an appendix to the report, acknowledged that young people are often ignored in the decision-making and policy information and yet they really bear the brunt of the effects of big policy issues for the world, like climate change and global security. The Ghanaian youth present at the roundtable were passionate contributors to the debate and expressed their frustration about the very limited influence that they had on these matters, both in a domestic sense but also internationally. The delegation supports efforts by the CPA for more engagement with young people, and notes the next opportunity for this engagement is the next conference—that's going to be held in Sydney later this year, so Australia has a good opportunity to help lead the way here in terms of hosting a more inclusive CPA conference for young people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With other delegates I attended the business meeting of the Commonwealth Women Parliamentarians which underlined the need to improve on reporting processes, and raised an issue around woefully inadequate time being allocated to the CWP members to not just conduct their business but also to get an agreement around the priorities that we would take before the CPA annual conference. Again, there were some good suggestions about ways that we would improve that in future CPA conferences.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On behalf of the delegation, I would like to extend our thanks to the members of the CPA Ghana branch and the parliament of Ghana, who were terrific hosts for the 66th Commonwealth Parliamentary Conference. The delegation was also very grateful to Her Excellency Berenice Owen-Jones, the Australian high commissioner in Ghana and to her staff, her amazing team, who provided very valuable briefing and support to the delegation. This included showcasing some local projects that have links to Australia and providing opportunities to better understand Ghana, its people and culture.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I'd like to thank the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade for their assistance, including the delegation secretary Jason Sherd for his sound advice and for keeping us always on track—no easy feat. I'd like to say a special thanks to the director of IPRO, Alex Cullum, who provided enormous support in the lead-up to our visit and throughout our time in Ghana, and to her staff—her terrific staff, it has to be said—for coordinating all of the arrangements.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As with previous Commonwealth Parliamentary Conferences, the 66th conference provided a valuable opportunity to reinforce ties with other Commonwealth parliaments, and we were pleased to be able to make useful contributions to debates and discussions, and to promote matters of importance to Australia. We look forward to the New South Wales parliament hosting the 67th CPA conference in Sydney. That will take place in November.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend the report to the House.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These amendments seek to split the Treasury Laws Amendment (Tax Accountability and Fairness) Bill 2023 in order to deal with the PwC schedules separately to the PRRT measure. The important point about this is that these issues are completely different. On the one hand, we have the PwC and Tax Practitioners Board issue, which rightly should be considered by this place. It's a very important issue in the integrity of our tax and tax administration system. On the other hand, we have the PRRT. These are completely different issues. Only this Treasurer could think that these issues should be considered in a single bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is how Labor does it. It's 'wedgislation', as they like to call it, where they put two things together that have no relationship to each other, and where they know those opposite to them will have a different view on the two things. There's a simple way to resolve that: split them. That's how you do it; it's not that hard. You just split it in two, and we can vote separately on the two different issues. But that's not the case for this Treasurer. We all have to remember that he's not interested in the policy; he's only ever interested in the politics. He likes to call himself Dr Chalmers, for a doctor he is, but he's not a doctor of economics; he's a doctor of spin, a doctor of politics, a doctor who plays politics every single day of the week rather than focusing on the issues that need to be focused on for the Australian people. It's the sort of thing that we've come to expect from this government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's important to understand what is in this PRRT legislation, because those opposite have brought a taxation bill to this place more than 15 times, having promised before the last election that they weren't going to raise taxes. I am sure that there will be many more of these situations, because the one thing we know about this government is that whatever it says before an election is completely different to what it does after an election. That was certainly the case in this instance and has been the case on issue after issue in relation to taxation. We know their minister opposite here is going after unrealised capital gains. He sees superannuation as his honey pot—he told us so. It's not the honey pot of the person who invested in it. It's not the honey pot of the person whose money it is. It's the honey pot of the Labor Party and the union movement. But that's how they see it. We see cynical legislation—'wedgislation'—in this place time after time after time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We wrote over 100 days ago to the Treasurer and to the relevant minister, the Minister for Resources, asking that they answer some very basic questions about this PRRT legislation. The proportion of forward estimates revenue that is additional and the model impact of the tax on investment are crucially important. The Treasurer is relying on these projects for his budget, and he won't even tell us what the impact is going to be on investment and the medium-term costing of the measure. We laid out four very commonsense, sensible proposals for improving the prospects for the gas industry, and what we've got back from those opposite is little more than nothing. They are not serious about the future of the gas industry in this country. They are not serious about the strength of the economy in this country. The only thing they are ever serious about is their own politics and looking after their mates in the union movement.</span>

It is worth noting for all members of this House that the effect of the amendment will be to further delay changes to the petroleum resource rent taxation arrangements. To understand that, we need to understand the history of these amendments. They started way back in 2014, when, under the former government, they commissioned Callaghan to review the arrangements. That review found, unsurprisingly, that they weren't fit for purpose. The government has made it a priority to ensure that Australian taxpayers get a fair share of the resources that are available for now and future generations, and that's exactly what this bill is designed to do.</span>

It was a practice under them; it's a practice under us. For some further context, there are some 12 bills that are currently before the House, and collectively they contain about 40 different schedules. If we were to debate all of those as separate bills, the business of the House would quite simply grind to a halt. So this is about ensuring that we can maximise the efficiency and effectiveness of the time before the House, and that's exactly why we are moving these matters.</span>

No, we won't be supporting a further delay to resolving these matters, in the interest of the Australian people.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wentworth</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:34</span>):  I'd like to speak briefly on this amendment. I don't think I agree with the coalition about the reason why they want to split this, in terms of the PRRT. We have different views on the role of the PRRT bill, but I 100 per cent agree with the point that the coalition is making, which is that these are two very distinct issues and this is politics. I'm new to politics; I've been here for less than two years. But this sort of wedging is exactly the sort of problem the Australian people have with politics as usual. This is about political points; it's not really about the issues of the day.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think these are two really serious issues. One is about an absolute abuse of power that had a huge, detrimental impact on Australian taxpayers, and it's a really a serious issue—enormous taxation. The other is about the future of, again, the Australian taxpayers in terms of how they are paid for offshore gas. They are two completely different issues. They shouldn't be in the same bill. There are other ways that the government is perfectly willing to use—guillotining debate and other things—when they want to get stuff done. They had the opportunity to do this. This is pure politics.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The petroleum resource rent tax is supposed to ensure that Australians get a fair return when their oil and gas resources are sold overseas, but the current system is completely broken. In the last couple of years, Australian LNG exports boomed as gas prices skyrocketed, with Climate Energy Finance estimating that gross profits of LNG exporters exceeded $63.5 billion in 2022. But, despite these profits and despite gas exporters being able to extract these resources without paying any additional royalties, the Australian people have seen little return. In the 2020-21 financial year, there were 33 projects eligible for PRRT, yet only six paid any tax. Even more shockingly, despite Australia being the second-largest LNG exporter in the world, the most recent set of budget papers noted:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… not a single LNG project has paid any PRRT and many are not expected to pay significant amounts of PRRT until the 2030s.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So the changes to the PRRT are welcome, and I appreciate the government taking action on this. It was well overdue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But, sadly, the government has not gone far enough in these changes and reform. Whilst a few projects that would never have paid PRRT will now do so, the main impact of the bill is to bring forward a small amount of revenue a few years earlier, giving the budget bottom line a boost today at the cost of taxpayers tomorrow. It's not even as much revenue as you would think. The reforms were originally slated to bring in just $600 million a year over the forward estimates, despite gas companies bringing in an additional $20 billion in revenue in the last financial year alone, yet in the latest Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook this amount had shrunk even further.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The lack of significant reform on PRRT is not only a missed opportunity for the budget bottom line; it's a missed opportunity to fund the kind of cost-of-living relief that households desperately need right now. If the government lowered the deductions cap from 90 per cent to 80 per cent, it could fully fund a people power plan that permanently lowers power bills for nearly half a million households by turbocharging the uptake of rooftop solar, home electrification and improved home energy performance. The government has not yet taken this chance, but it must, and I hope it changes its way—at least in the Senate. I also want to put on record my deep concerns about the concessions the government are rumoured to be making to secure support in the Senate, which could result in massive expansion of the fossil fuel industry in the midst of a climate crisis. This would be a deep betrayal.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So my amendment asks the government to be open to doing things better in the future, to reviewing whether these new arrangements are delivering a fair return and to further reforming the tax if necessary. My amendment would insert a statutory review of the changes to the PRRT, to be commenced no later than 1 July 2026. This would allow two full financial years for the government changes to take effect and for it to become clear whether these reforms are delivering an equitable return to the taxpayer. Like the Callaghan review and the gas transfer pricing review, this review would examine whether the superprofits from our resources are being shared equally between the taxpayer and gas exporters. But, unlike these reviews, it would consider how learnings from reforms to the PRRT could be applied to the other resource export industries, which are increasingly important as our economy decarbonises. This is a reasonable and constructive amendment that would help deliver a fair return for Australian taxpayers in the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to make a further point, which is that we sent this amendment to the Treasurer's office back in November last year and I think it was only today or yesterday that we got a response or engagement on this amendment. I will constantly work with respect with members of the government on this and on any other amendments because they are made in good faith. These are challenges that I am making because I think they could be better, but I'm always open to having a conversation about these things. I was very disappointed not to get more constructive engagement from Treasurer or Assistant Treasurer on these matters, because they are really important and my community expects to understand, in a fulsome and time-appropriate way, what the government's position on this is and, if we have different views, why those are there so that we can engage constructively, perhaps to come to a middle ground.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Goldstein</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:48</span>):  I rise to support the amendment proposed by the member for Wentworth. This legislation is simply not good enough. It's not good enough for the government to bundle together a couple of random items and to expect a pat on the back from the parliament—in effect, a tick and flick. Put simply, this is an abuse of process and less than the voters expect from our parliament and its elected representatives. At best it's lazy, and at worst it's a deliberate attempt to underplay the significance of these two issues—one issue being imposing adequate taxes on our resources and the other issue being critically needed oversights on consulting companies, who've recently been exposed for their poor behaviour.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To be abundantly clear, I would prefer to see the bill split as proposed by the member for Indi in her second reading amendment. However, this amendment from the member for Wentworth would go some way to imposing some oversight on the proposed changes to the PRRT. There would be a review of the effectiveness of the changes to the act in line with recommendations from the Callaghan review instituted by the previous government. We would then know just how much is being returned to the taxpayer for exploitation of an asset owned by all of us: the fossil fuels deep underground and underwater. This is critical, and I remain deeply concerned that, at a time of cost-of-living pressure and a critical energy transition, when we need the revenue, we are way underdone on tax on export gas. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also know that in the lead-up to the last budget the Treasurer had three options in front of him on the PRRT, and we discovered, courtesy of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian</span><span style="font-style:italic;">Financial Review</span>, that he chose the option that the gas producers wanted. Four vulnerable seats in Western Australia may have had something to do with it, and also the fact that Woodside appears to have a stranglehold on public opinion in WA and that its media are the most concentrated in the country and enablers of the fossil fuel lobby. This is not the way to make policy affecting the whole nation. At budget time, the government estimated that its new approach would raise no more than $2.4 billion over the next four years, and it now turns out that it won't even do that, as, in the Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook, the Treasury revised the estimates, revealing that it will be much less than originally predicted. The <span style="font-style:italic;">AFR</span> also calculated that at current prices the second option that was offered to the Treasurer would have brought in $21.9 billion in 2023-24 alone, but, instead, as the paper put it back at budget time:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The big gas producers can go back to what they do best—exporting huge amounts of Australian gas and printing money …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is not a good illustration of the government's supposed aims to restore public confidence in the way that policy and legislation is done. I have had this conversation with the Assistant Treasurer. I have made very clear that I think the bundling together of these two entirely disparate matters is not good process. I think the bill should have been split. Given that the government will not tolerate that and does not find it palatable, much as I think the vast majority of the Australian people would, I definitely support the member for Wentworth's amendments. </span>

I acknowledge that they have engaged in good faith on these measures, including the amendments, and other bills that have come forward in my portfolio before now, and I look forward to them continuing to do so. I also note that people can engage in good faith and, frankly, just disagree, and this is one of those occasions. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Briefly, the reasoning for not supporting the amendments is this: this package of laws has come forward as a result of two separate reviews, the first of which was initiated back in 2014. We want finality and certainty. We've implemented the change. We've looked at all the competing views and forces. Frankly, in the community and even in this parliament there are people who want more gas, there are people who want less gas and there are people who want no gas and, therefore, no revenue arising out of the gas. I think that's a fairly accurate summation of the views right across the chamber. We're trying to strike the right balance, and we believe the 90 per cent deductions cap strikes the right balance in ensuring that we have sufficient gas supply, particularly for the manufacturing industry in Australia, for as long and until we have a viable economic alternative energy source, particularly for those sectors. For the Australian people, it means that we'll get more revenue sooner and provide certainty for industry. I don't believe that the amendments moved by the member for Wentworth will deliver on that objective. Parliament is ultimately the reviewer of all measures and bills that come before this House and will continue to do so. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms STEGGALL</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Warringah</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:04</span>):  I rise to speak on the Superannuation (Objective) Bill 2023. I must admit from the outset that I'm sceptical about the usefulness of this bill and suspect an ulterior motive from the government. The government has not laid out a clear or cogent case as to exactly why this bill is needed and why it is needed now. I would like to see further clarity from the government on this point: why this bill, and why now?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians now have some $3.5 trillion invested in super. Australia's superannuation system is highly regarded around the world, despite decades-long political battles between the two major parties in this place and an astonishing lack of consensus that many of my constituents are very sick of. The Melbourne Mercer global pension index ranks the Australian retirement system third in a field of 37 countries. The main message is that Australians should be comfortable and secure in their twilight years, still living a great life. Super is an integral part of that. But there is always room for improvement in our superannuation system, and, sadly, this bill doesn't do that. Many in the Warringah community are sceptical of the government's recent moves on super. Their plans have been based on the rules and objectives already in place. Instead, we have a bill in front of us today that seems to be a solution in search of a problem. Surely we could use our time in this House more effectively to address the existing inequities in our super system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What does this bill do? It seeks to place into law:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The objective of superannuation is to preserve savings to deliver income for a dignified retirement, alongside government support, in an equitable and sustainable way.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill requires policymakers to assess future changes to superannuation legislation for compatibility with the objective and include a statement of compatibility with the objective in explanatory materials.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Although the words 'dignified', 'equitable' and 'sustainable' appear to be relatively anodyne, they are open to interpretation. What exactly is meant by these words and putting them in the legislation is very unclear. Leaving it open to interpretation is bad legislation and bad policy. The bill is not clear or specific. It is capable of varying interpretation and has the potential to conflict with existing provisions in the superannuation legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The explanatory memorandum to this bill states that the superannuation system is an important source of capital in the economy which can support investment in capacity-building areas of the economy where there is alignment between the best financial interests of members and national economic priorities. This suggests potential tension between the role of the superannuation trustee, whose duty is solely to members of a fund, and those who decide national economic priorities. This seems to be the government wanting to get its hands on superannuation funds.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The apparent intention of the bill is that future actions, either legislative or those delegated to policymakers in law, consider and take into account the purpose of superannuation as set out in this bill—that is, that it look at the best financial interests of members and this idea of national economic priorities. What exactly should happen when those two clash? And, however, the recent antecedents to this bill suggest its purpose is backward rather than forward looking.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Treasurer has stated:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The last decade saw the former government raid the superannuation system for its own purposes with a devastating impact on the savings of millions of Australians. Legislating an objective of super will help prevent this happening again.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I disagree. It will have no such effect. In this bill, the government proposes to replace one form of political gamesmanship of the superannuation system with another. This bill is window-dressing masquerading as proper, well-thought-out law. I will be opposing this bill, and I note a number of key stakeholders oppose this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Institute of Chartered Accountants, the Institute of Financial Professionals Australia and the Institute of Public Accountants made a joint submission on this bill. They rightly note that the sole purpose test for superannuation has been codified over the last 40 years and provides that superannuation must meet core tests. Therefore, this establishes the objective of super. It's worth reminding the House exactly what that is: the core purpose is the provision of retirement benefits after 65 or death benefits if death occurs before retirement. Ancillary purposes are: benefits on termination of employment; benefits on ceasing employment due to mental or physical ill health; death benefits to a member's private legal representative or dependants if a death occurs after retirement; or any other purpose that the regulator approves in writing. These organisations argue that a far better approach is to amend the sole purpose test if the government wishes to change objectives of superannuation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill should be taken back to the drawing board, and I encourage the government to do just that. Chartered Accountants Australia and New Zealand, the Institute of Finance Professionals Australia, the Institute of Public Accountants and CPA Australia suggest that the government should create an objective for the entire retirement system—this would include housing, the age pension, superannuation and savings outside superannuation—rather than focus solely on superannuation. I suggest that this is where the government should start: state a clear and practical vision for the entire retirement system and then define the objective of superannuation consistent with this. The security of those in retirement is too important to be the subject of constant political point scoring. If the government were to first state a clear vision for the entire retirement system, it would open a conversation with the Australian people that might achieve a bipartisan approach to the objective of superannuation within the broader framework of retirement security that is more balanced and future focused. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I encourage the government to continue to expedite the work towards a more equitable super system for women. The recent announcement that from next year superannuation will be payable on government paid parental leave is welcome. Modelling by Equity Economics shows that if an average Australian woman had the same rate of workforce participation after having children as that of a woman in Sweden, for example, she would retire with an extra $180,000 in superannuation. To put it more starkly, a recent report from the Super Members Council found that women today are expected to retire earlier and live longer than men but currently retire with a third less super. The same report found that paying super on the paid parental leave scheme would leave a mother of two some $12,500 dollars better off at retirement and therefore would make a meaningful reduction in the gender super gap which currently sits at around $50,000. But this is still very modest. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another barrier noted in the report are the changes to the low-income superannuation tax offset which currently finds those earning less are taxed more heavily on their superannuation. Women make up the majority of low-income earners, but the full tax refund on super guarantees currently only covers those earning up to $37,000. Women constitute only 38.4 per cent of all full-time employees in Australia, while they make up 68.5 per cent of the part-time and casual workforce. Modifying the threshold to $45,000 would boost the super of more than 1.2 million Australians by an extra $500 million in the 2025-26 financial year alone; 60 per cent of these individuals are women. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is also work to be done with First Nations people to improve their retirement outcomes and access to superannuation. The 2020 Retirement Income Review found that many First Nations people were likely to have either no superannuation or low super balances, much lower than non-Indigenous Australians, at retirement. We need to give more focus to these issues as policymakers, particularly as we look to close the gaps on so many fronts, many of which the government and the opposition continue to fall short on. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the sort of policy change that the government should be bringing forward to debate to help improve the superannuation system, particularly for women. We can't forget what the super system is meant to be—a retirement that allows the eldest among us to live out their twilight years in dignity—and so I urge the government to rethink their approach. </span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr LAXALE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bennelong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:13</span>):  The narrative of superannuation in Australia reads like a cyclical tale of progress met with resistance. At its core, the history of superannuation is a story of a visionary policy introduced by a Labor government which has, predictably, faced opposition and resistance from the Liberals since its inception. This pattern has recurred through the decades, shaping superannuation into what we have today. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Hawke Labor government recognise the fundamental need for a system that ensures Australians can retire with dignity, a system where workers' lifelong contributions are acknowledged and preserved for their retirement years. This government acknowledges the work of past Labor governments to establish this world-leading retirement program that we are fortunate to have today. This Labor government continues to honour that work, and we recommit ourselves to the intentions of the Hawke government: that super exists to fund a dignified retirement. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A dignified retirement is something everyone has a right to. We are wealthy country, and after a lifetime of work Australians shouldn't be broke at retirement, so we need to ensure that super serves for retirement. But what we have seen from the Liberals, the original opposes of super, is that they continue to seek to undermine it. You see, they can't get rid of superannuation, so they continue to try and chip away at it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Warringah asked why this bill is necessary. This bill is necessary because we need to stop stupid ideas eroding our retirement savings, because we have seen the Liberals enact policies that risk retirement savings' long-term security and growth. We saw the Liberals, against sound advice, allow people to raid their super during the pandemic. This was a policy which encouraged people to fund their personal pandemic response with their own retirement savings. An estimated $38 billion of early withdrawals was allowed during the pandemic. It's been estimated that this will end up costing super fund members $85 billion in retirement. It will also cost every taxpayer. Modelling released very recently by the Super Members Council shows that the early release of super scheme enacted by the Morrison government will mean a higher reliance on the age pension and lower tax from superannuation, which will hit $2½ billion per year from taxpayers by the mid-2060s.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Disgustingly, this Morrison government policy hurt young people the most. It wiped out super balances and will stop young workers receiving the benefits of compounding interests right into retirement. According to the analysis, all of today's 20-year-olds are projected to pay about $3,000 more in tax to cover the high pension bill caused by the Morrison government's scheme. In an example of a 30-year-old who withdrew the maximum $20,000 from super during the pandemic, they will have $93,600 less at retirement, leaving the member dramatically worse off in their lifetime. That's one person projected to lose nearly $100,000 in retirement because of the Liberal's ideological opposition to superannuation for retirement. Bad policies on super lead to bad outcomes in retirement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now we see the Liberals doubling down on their continued attacks on superannuation. Despite their super for homes policy being ridiculed in the final days of the 2022 federal election, they have shockingly recommitted themselves to this policy blunder under the Leader of the Opposition. They want Australians to fund the housing crisis from their own super. They've got no interest in fixing the housing crisis through good policy; they instead want young people to use their retirement savings to fix their policy mistakes. Instead of supporting the Housing Australia Future Fund, they want people to use their retirement savings. Instead of supporting the Help to Buy scheme, they want renters to eat into their nest eggs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With around 16 million Australians holding a superannuation account and the total value of funds under management now exceeding $3.6 trillion, it's clear that Labor's super system plays a critical role in our economy and the lives of every citizen. Everyone—bar the Liberals, seemingly—knows the system's success hinges on its protection from short-sighted policies. Proposals like those put forward by those opposite in the past and the present will hurt young workers and jeopardise their retirement. That's why we need this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But don't just take my word for it. Let's delve into the history books and see what the Liberals have said about their own policy. In 2017, the current opposition leader criticised super for homes for potentially fuelling housing prices and worsening the crisis. The current shadow finance minister echoed this sentiment, warning it would likely push prices up, not down. Even the deputy opposition leader highlighted the vital need for superannuation in retirement, not as a bandaid for housing market pressures. Despite knowing all this and, in some cases, even publicly acknowledging it, they still resuscitate this old, lifeless plan with the complete understanding superannuation relies upon compounding interest and is designed to secure a comfortable retirement for workers, not to serve as a bandaid for their policy failures.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government understands the importance of a secure and robust superannuation system. The Grattan Institute's analysis reinforces our stance, showing that allowing early access to superannuation for home deposits would do little to improve homeownership rates, particularly for younger and less affluent Australians. For those in the 20-to-24 age group with average super balances of just over $15,000, the impact of their ability to enter the housing market would be minimal. However, the long-term consequences for their retirement savings could be severe.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is just the latest in decades of efforts to threaten and undermine superannuation. John Howard in 1996 pledged to continue with the scheduled increase to the superannuation guarantee; however, he did not. Tony Abbott's tenure as Prime Minister saw a similar pattern of promise and retraction. Leading up to the 2013 election, the Abbott government committed to increasing the superannuation contribution, and that was also an unkept pledge.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, we've mentioned the access to super during the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2019, while they opened up access to superannuation and continued to collect a 15.6 per cent superannuation rate, they were fighting internally about whether to break the Morrison government's commitment to increase superannuation of ordinary workers to 12 per cent by 2025. These episodes in history have not been just one-offs; they've not been missteps; they reveal an insight into the ideological opposition by the Liberals to superannuation for retirement. Their approach, characterised by broken promises and policy reversals, undermines the stability that is essential for effective retirement planning. It sends a message of uncertainty to workers and retirees alike, who question the reliability of superannuation as a pillar of their retirement strategy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, in this context, our government's commitment to protecting and strengthening superannuation becomes even more critical. This bill seeks to correct past missteps by enshrining into legislation a clear, unambiguous objective for superannuation. It's simple and it matters. The objective is that super should exist to preserve savings to deliver income for a dignified retirement, alongside government support, in an equitable and sustainable way. This should not be controversial, because this is, in essence, what superannuation is all about. It is a means to ensure that, after a lifetime of work, individuals can retire with dignity, supported by their savings. We are proposing to stabilise the superannuation objective by ensuring that any legislative changes are evaluated for their alignment with the core objective of superannuation, fostering transparency and accountability in policymaking.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill also seeks to reflect a broader understanding of superannuation's role in our economy and society. It acknowledges that superannuation is about individual savings and its collective benefit to the Australian economy. With approximately $3.6 trillion under management, superannuation is a significant source of capital, driving investments in infrastructure, innovation and sustainable development. It is an explicit declaration of our government's commitment to safeguarding the retirement future of millions of Australians. By legislating the objective of super, we are protecting individual savings and reinforcing the system's role in our national economy and society, because superannuation isn't just financial support; it's a guarantee to safeguard our future and a commitment to Australian workers and a legacy for our children and grandchildren.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The challenges and debates regarding superannuation policy are complex, but the objective should not be controversial. It should remain simple and unchanged: to provide for a dignified retirement. Those opposite have repeatedly proved that, whether it be on housing, climate change, Medicare or, of course, super, they just aren't committed to making the choices that will deliver long-term support, security and prosperity to Australians. Thankfully, we have a government that is always committed to supporting superannuation in Australia. I commend this bill to the House.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms DANIEL</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Goldstein</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:24</span>):  Superannuation is a manifestation of our nation's commitment to the principles of its founding: a fair go, secure quality of life and a dignified retirement for all Australians. The program was designed with a vision that every Australian, after a lifetime of contributing to the fabric of our society, could look forward to their retirement with confidence. It's a promise from the present to the future, a modern safeguard against the human uncertainties of old age.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The value of our superannuation program extends beyond individual security; it's also about societal stability and economic foresight. By ensuring our citizens have adequate funds in retirement, we're not only safeguarding their individual futures but also securing the health of our economy. We're enabling more people to manage their own retirement in the way they wish, with sufficient resources to do so. It provides them with choice. At the same time, we're reducing pressure on the budget by ensuring that fewer retirees have to resort to the pension.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Superannuation has a stabilising effect on financial markets, enables public spending elsewhere and provides a massive pool of investment capital for the nation. This pool is the fourth-largest holder of pension fund assets in the world, now amounting to at least $3.5 trillion, and provides Australia with influence and leverage in international capital markets.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Today, the House has the opportunity to codify the principles of our superannuation system, and by extension many of the underlying principles of our national identity, into law. I will vote to take this opportunity to help to entrench a dignified retirement for all living Australians now and those to come.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This action is necessary because the integrity of Australia's superannuation system is not futureproof. We've seen clear intent from governments of the very recent past to get hooked on the idea of encouraging the opportunistic withdrawal of savings in superannuation accounts, often to pay for overt policy failures. Housing supply and the resulting lack of affordability is one example, and I'll come back to it in a moment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The authorisation of the early release of superannuation savings during the COVID-19 pandemic was another example. In 2020, up to three million Australians withdrew a total of $38 billion from their super balances early. Research by Tristram Sainsbury at the Australian National University, among others, found that an Australian who withdrew $10,000, the maximum permitted, may well have lost $120,000 by the time they reach retirement. The evidence is that those aged between 25 and 35 who withdrew early reduced their balance by fully 51 per cent. It is money gone, reducing what will be available to them during retirement and therefore the opportunities available to them later in life.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The implications of this policy will resonate into the future, but it also had an immediate, observable social impact. There's a strong correlation between those Australians most likely to access their superannuation early and financial disadvantage. Those on lower incomes who withdrew some of their super were more likely, on average, to increase their spending on gambling, for example.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On housing, homeownership is a persistent and worsening policy challenge for Australia—one that is also central to our national identity. House prices have soared to record highs. But accessing superannuation to solve this problem is not good governance. The former government's super home buyers scheme is another example of the seductive opportunism and indeed populism of policy of this nature. Evidence suggests that such a scheme would merely push up house prices, with the likely small balances accessed immediately chewed up and replaced with debt. It's also possible that such a scheme would limit the mobility of Australians who accessed it, discouraging them from moving away for a new job or into a bigger dwelling to start a family, for example.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also know that superannuation provides security for women and drawing on it early exacerbates financial fault lines that cut across genders. Across every age group, men consistently have considerably more in their superannuation savings balances. Early access to super during the pandemic therefore widened the retirement savings gap between men and women. As a result, more women will retire with less security, more women will retire with less independence and more women have a less certain future. These are the social and structural impacts of policy which undermines our superannuation system, and I will vote to ensure that this mistake will not be repeated.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would add very clearly that this policy was the brainchild of my predecessor, the former member for Goldstein. I opposed it before the 2022 election for the reasons that I have just outlined, and I continue to wholeheartedly oppose it now. Structural housing policy failures by successive governments, state and federal, should not be handballed to holders of limited superannuation in the form of the disastrous idea of encouraging people to deplete their retirement savings. It's far better to encourage and foster additional, voluntary super contributions, plus investment earnings on the deposited amount, which can be later withdrawn to help you pay for your first home. The money you contribute to your super grows based on the super investment mix you've chosen. That I agree with, and it should be extended, too, with women being allowed to make extra contributions to top up their super without a tax penalty when they've spent time out of the workforce. That's something that I'm working on with the Treasurer.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill requires all new legislation presented to parliament and all new regulations developed by the executive branch to provide a statement of compatibility to explain how the item is compatible with the principles and social objectives of superannuation. This is a sensible and modest provision to safeguard both the material circumstances of Australians in their retirement and the basic founding pillars of our social fabric, and for this reason I will vote for this bill.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Holt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:31</span>):  I rise to support the passage of the Superannuation (Objective) Bill 2023, a crucial piece of legislation aimed at enshrining the fundamental purpose of superannuation into law. As we meet here today, it is important to acknowledge the role of the Labor Party in championing superannuation as a fundamental right for every Australian worker.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The history of superannuation in Australia is deeply entwined with the labour movement's tireless advocacy for the working class. For decades prior to the establishment of a formal superannuation scheme, the welfare of retirees often depended on negotiated agreements between labour unions and employers. However, it was the vision and determination of the Labor Party that led to the creation of a comprehensive superannuation system designed to provide security and dignity in retirement for all Australians. The pivotal moment came in 1983, with the Prices and Incomes Accord, a historic agreement between the government, businesses and trade unions. This marked the beginning of employer contribution to superannuation funds, a groundbreaking initiative aimed at promoting self-funded retirement savings and reducing reliance on publicly funded pension systems. Despite initial resistance from small-business groups, the introduction of compulsory superannuation was a triumph for working Australians, ensuring that all employees had access to secure retirement savings.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Hawke-Keating government had a vision for a three-pillar approach to retirement income—comprising compulsory employer contribution, additional voluntary contribution and a means-tested government-funded age pension—that would lay the foundation for a robust and sustainable retirement income system. In 1992 this scheme was complemented with the superannuation guarantee, ensuring that all employers had to contribute a set amount on top of their employee's salaries. When former Treasurer Dawkins introduced the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Bill 1992, he noted that one of the objectives of the superannuation guarantee was to extend coverage to those who did not have it. He stated:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Superannuation was the preserve of a few, mainly the wealthy …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The reform of superannuation has been one of the great achievements of the Government. Over its term of office, the Government has greatly expanded access to superannuation savings. In particular, award superannuation has fostered the spread of superannuation to large areas of the work force which previously had no cover.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This scheme has been a huge success, placing wealth in the hands of working Australians on a scale not seen around the world, reaching an estimated $3.5 trillion in 2023.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Subsequent governments have contributed to the evolution of the superannuation system, gradually increasing the superannuation guarantee rate and introducing reforms to improve portability and performance. Superannuation moves people off the age pension, lowering future government payments and ensuring that as the population ages the government can still afford to provide vital services. In the UK, spending on the pension accounts for 5.1 per cent of GDP. In Australia, because of our superannuation system, spending on the age pension is only 2.3 per cent of GDP and is expected to fall even as the average Australian gets older.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia boasts a world-class superannuation system which has been admired by countries around the globe. However, over the past decade superannuation policy has been marred by confusion, costliness and chaos. We have witnessed the detrimental impact of short-sighted decision-making, including the raiding of superannuation funds for purposes unrelated to retirement savings, resulting in significant losses for millions of Australians. Because of the choices of the previous Liberal government, around $36 billion in savings were drained out of super accounts in a matter of months. A 35-year-old who withdrew $10,000 under the COVID early-release scheme—a third of average savings for someone that age—will be over $150,000 worse off in retirement. And 600,000 young people under the age of 35 who made this decision now have no super at all.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At every opportunity, the coalition chooses to use workers' superannuation to bail itself out of difficult and important policy decisions. Underscoring this is that while opposing paid family and domestic violence leave the Liberals were in the process of drafting legislation that would have forced women fleeing violent relationships to access their superannuation to fund their escape. Now the Liberal Party wants to raid your retirement savings again so that you can afford a home. These decisions, once again, align with the Liberal Party's policies to bury their heads in the sand and rob from the next generation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is why I stand today to support this bill. Rather than thinking of the short term, we are here to outline a long-term vision for our great nation. Despite its central role in the retirement income system, there is no agreed objective of superannuation to serve as a guide for policymakers. The primary object of this bill is to define the purpose of superannuation so there is long-term assurance to the system. We have set forward a simple objective for the system to preserve savings to deliver income for a dignified retirement alongside government support in an equitable and sustainable way. This clear and concise objective will serve as a guiding principle for all stakeholders, fostering greater confidence in our superannuation system. By legislating an objective for superannuation, we aim to prevent mismanagement and ensure that the focus remains squarely on the long-term interests of members. This objective will safeguard the integrity of the superannuation system, reaffirming its commitment to providing a dignified retirement for all Australians. It will ensure that snap decisions of a government will not lead to a generation of Australians missing out.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will secure the future of superannuation by embedding its purpose into law, thereby ensuring that any future changes to the system are aligned with this overarching objective. Ministers will be required to justify proposed changes to superannuation to parliament, considering this legislated purpose. This will ensure accountability and transparency in decision-making processes that impact Australians' retirement savings. Importantly, the objective outlined in this legislation does not absolve superannuation trustees from their existing obligations. Trustees will continue to be bound by their duty to make investment decisions in the best financial interests of their members. Additionally, members will retain the ability to access their superannuation on compassionate grounds or in cases of genuine financial hardship. As more Australians than ever before approach retirement age, the imperative of enhanced retirement incomes has never been more pressing. This bill represents a crucial step towards strengthening our superannuation system for the next generation, ensuring its resilience and effectiveness in supporting retirees.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am pleased to note the strong support for this bill from industrial stakeholders, whose engagement has been invaluable throughout the legislative process. The ACTU wrote in its submission that it 'is pleased that the government has considered the objective of superannuation from first principles' and proposed an objective which would go closer to the originating purpose of superannuation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is predicted that by 2035 the superannuation system, currently worth $3.5 trillion, will outstrip the Australian banking sector. This will see superannuation playing a significant role in contributing to the strength of our financial markets. There are opportunities to leverage its national economic priorities while aligning them with the best interests of members.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Already, the superannuation sector invests in vital long-term assets such as toll roads, electricity grids, airports, hospitals, housing and ports. Just this week, former federal Treasurer, Wayne Swan, chair of Cbus, made a commitment for super funds to have a substantial role in building 40,000 affordable homes to help fix the nation's housing crisis. He stated:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… We are confident that investment in the social housing sector has the potential to be a win-win for our members—by providing stable long-term returns for their super balances, as well as construction industry jobs …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the long-term vision we need for super: to provide a dignified retirement for Australians, to support working-class Australians to build wealth and to invest in our country's future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill marks a pivotal moment in the ongoing evolution of Australia's superannuation system. As custodians of this pivotal pillar of our social and economic infrastructure, it is upon us to protect and enhance it for the benefit of current and future generations. I am proud to stand before you as a member of the Labor Party, which plays a pivotal role in building and safeguarding Australia's super system. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, superannuation stands as a testament to the Labor Party's commitment to advancing the interests of the working class and promoting economic fairness and social justice. As we reflect on the history of superannuation in Australia, we must recognise it as one of the great achievements of the Labor Party movement, ensuring that all Australians can retire with dignity and security. Let us continue to work together to ensure that it remains a cornerstone of retirement security for all Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I extend my gratitude to the Prime Minister and the Treasurer for their work on this bill. I commend this bill to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">North Sydney</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:43</span>):  I want to start by making a very clear statement, and that is that in no terms, in no way should the superannuation savings of Australians ever be seen as a fund to be used by government for public benefit. Super is not a government bank. Super is everyday Australians taking responsibility for the ageing process and building capital behind themselves.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Occupational superannuation first emerged in Australia in the mid-19th century. Its purpose since then has changed substantially. It was initially seen as a tool that was available to just a select group of salaried employees, through to acting as a supplement to the age pension for mostly white-collar workers. Then, in 1992, the then Treasurer, the Hon. John Kerin, announced a new system, to be known as the superannuation guarantee, that would require employers to make superannuation contributions on behalf of their employees. The whole system shifted. If you worked—no matter where you worked—you had the opportunity to build a nest egg to ensure that when you stopped working at retirement age there was at least some capital behind you.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The reaction from the opposition at the time was exactly as we have come to expect: one that predicted it would be a disaster, leading to unprecedented levels of unemployment. Yet, interestingly, trawling back through the records of the debate at that time, there seems to be little true debate about the purpose of superannuation, and the legislation itself did not include a statement about the objective. It did, however, establish the sole purpose test that effectively requires superannuation funds to act for the sole purpose of providing retirement benefits to their members. It's pretty clear that it was to provide superannuation funds to act for the sole purpose of providing retirement benefit to their members.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And that brings us to now, 32 years later. I rise to speak today to the Superannuation (Objective) Bill 2023—not to foretell of the potential for a disastrous outcome but to offer the thoughts of my electorate of North Sydney as to what debate on this sort of reform should seek to address and what questions remain to be answered. Given the speakers we've heard in just the last hour, as we've all stood, those questions remain even in the face of this draft legislation. While my community welcomes in principle the move to legislate a superannuation objective to prevent inconsistent changes to the superannuation system in the long term, it is imperative that any objective protects the ability of Australians to build their superannuation balances in line with their long-term ambitions, rather than simply empowering any government of the day to pursue their economic aims by counting on the billions of dollars in balances that are not theirs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In this context, the bill raises several issues for my community. Firstly, it lacks a total income retirement perspective. While I believe finding an objective for superannuation could help create a shared understanding of the super system against which to judge any future policy settings, I would also argue the objectives should cover the entire retirement income system, including the age pension and related benefits. Secondly, the proposed definition includes several subjective terms not defined in the bill, and multiple stakeholders have raised their concerns about these with me directly. Finally, with no mechanism to ensure governments are held accountable to the definition, it is likely that this bill will ultimately achieve very little.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Ultimately, this bill is one of many pieces of legislation and proposed changes being suggested by this government that I fear will, in combination, risk undermining confidence in the super system. As we've seen in the past, governments can and will use the superannuation system to their advantage with little regard for its original purpose. For this reason, the creation of a central objective for superannuation may provide some greater protection. As we saw with the previous government, the super system was used by them to shirk their responsibilities during COVID, allowing people to access their retirement savings rather than supporting them. Effectively, that government forced people to choose between keeping a roof over their heads in the immediate term and having enough to comfortably retire on later—not a question that any 30-year-old can see with any perspective. Now, this current government is using the super system to fill a budget black hole by introducing a poorly designed tax on super earnings over $3 million, without indexing the threshold and including unrealised gains in the calculation of earnings, causing concern—particularly among those with land or business premises owned by self-managed super funds, such as farmers and small-business owners.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">From a personal perspective, I believe any objective should help create a shared understanding of what the superannuation system is truly trying to achieve and it should provide certainty for the many millions of Australians who are doing the right thing by saving for their retirement. However, I believe that, when you are talking about retirement planning, the current truth is that super is only one pillar of Australia's retirement saving system, which actually comprises compulsory savings through the superannuation guarantee and voluntary savings, including pre-tax and post-tax super contributions. Thus, any objective set for this channel must recognise that. The other pillars are the means-tested age pension, provided by government and guaranteeing a minimum safety net of income in retirement, and voluntary savings and other assets—such as financial assets and housing—that can contribute towards living standards in retirement. Yet I frequently hear from constituents about the problems created when these pillars do not work together to provide an adequate retirement. Indeed, at the moment, I have one gentleman in my electorate who is struggling: he worked hard his entire life to pay off his apartment, only to find himself now not eligible for any sort of pension and trying to cover increasing strata fees. The system overall is broken, and a simple objective will not address that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">According to the explanatory memorandum:</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">1.38 The inclusion of Government support in the objective reflects the crucial link between superannuation policy and government support.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But merely including the term 'government support' in the objective does not go far enough in linking all the elements of the retirement system. In this case I believe it would be more worthwhile to set objectives for the retirement income system as a whole, guaranteeing a minimum standard of living and allowing policymakers to use a combination of policy tools—be that superannuation, housing policy, the age pension—and other mechanisms to achieve this minimum standard.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, the proposed definition leaves much open to interpretation. The bill defines the objective of superannuation in the following terms 'to preserve savings to deliver income for a dignified retirement, alongside government support, in an equitable and sustainable way'. You may not pick it up on first reading, but many stakeholders have expressed concern to me about key concepts within this objective, noting that these terms are subjective and open to interpretation. They are ultimately not defined within the bill. The terms 'preserve savings', 'deliver income', 'dignified retirement', 'alongside government support', 'equitable and sustainable' appear to mean different things to different stakeholders, creating potential uncertainty in the sector. It fails to leave us with peace of mind that the governments are safeguarding our savings.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Ultimately, uncertainty is being created within the sector, which is the very opposite of what we are hoping this legislation will achieve. Notably, the government chose not to change the proposed definition; it did not change it from its original form despite concerns about definitions being raised during the consultation process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, the proposed objectives lack enforceability. When tabling the legislation, the assistant minister, Stephen Jones, said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This will make policymakers more accountable when considering changes that affect Australians' retirement savings.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But it's difficult to see how this will be the case when the objective lacks enforceability. The bill requires members of parliament who introduce the bill that proposed changes to the superannuation system to write a statement of compatibility explaining how the bill is compatible with the legislated objective of superannuation. Similar requirements are made of other regulations related to superannuation. But it does not create an enforceable right or duty. Statements of compatibility will not be binding, and there are no consequences for failing to comply with the proposed obligations. It doesn't include requirements like a formal assessment of compliance against the proposed objective or regular reporting of policy changes made against it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">According to the Law Council of Australia, a legislative purpose will not constrain future parliaments and therefore only represents a political, rather than a legal, restraint on future forms. So I cannot help but feel this bill will achieve little. At a time when so much seemingly needs to be addressed in our superannuation system, including the fundamental gender inequity built into the system and the need to balance the opportunity cost of lost income in a world where housing affordability appears to be the consistent economic challenge of this generation, this definition leaves us wanting—wanting inspiration, wanting true direction and wanting long-term confidence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Concerningly, this reform is also just one of multiple changes to superannuation being suggested by this government, and the people of North Sydney are worried these changes are intended, in part, to drive people towards large superannuation and standardise products and away from self-managed funds. Indeed, the better targeted superannuation bill coming before this parliament shortly is a prime example of this push. In a radical departure from most of the income tax regime, where taxes are normally only assessed on realised gains, the better targeted super bill is riddled with problems, and while my community supports the overarching idea of reducing tax concessions through excessively large investment holdings, the proposal as it currently stands is far from equitable and is poorly structured.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is, as I said earlier, a tax grab to fill a budget black hole. It means people who have been told for decades to hold any assets they don't need until retirement in their super will pay tax on them even though they haven't been sold. That income will not be refunded or paid back if their balance drops to below $3 million. Ultimately, without indexation, more and more people will be captured by a cap that has been set arbitrarily. It is simply not fair nor equitable that fund members have their savings eroded by thresholds that are not indexed or that people will be paying tax on assets they have not realised.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As in many other areas, increasing cynicism and a lack of trust mean that the relationship between government and the people is broken when it comes to super. Government is increasingly intervening in super, and I fear that skewing the system towards big funds and a one-size-fits-all approach won't work and won't allow for self-managed fund options. Australia desperately needs a retirement income system that guarantees a minimum standard of living for everyone, but I do not believe that legislating this objective for superannuation, with little regard for the retirement income system as a whole, will go far enough towards achieving that. With little enforcement mechanism, it is difficult to see that this bill will achieve much at all.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GEORGANAS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Adelaide</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:55</span>):  I rise in support of the Superannuation (Objective) Bill 2023, an important bill that gives us an objective for what superannuation is and should be and what its aims are. Of course, superannuation was brought in by the Labor government, the former Hawke-Keating government, back in the nineties. It was meant to preserve savings for workers—people on wages and in businesses—to allow them to retire in dignity with a bit of income. It is an important Labor reform that was introduced in the mid-nineties, and it's something that this side of the House has supported continuously because we know the importance of ensuring that people who are working have some savings in their retirement to be able to live with dignity. This bill introduces an objective to ensure that it serves as a guide for different governments of all persuasions when they come into this place to make decisions for regulators, industry and the wider community. We know that superannuation is important, and we know that it is one of the mechanisms that we have to ensure that people have an income or some savings when they retire.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently I spoke with a constituent in my electorate who had received superannuation payments only twice in the span of 18 months of work. He was relatively young and is already facing financial hardships due to the absence of these contributions towards his retirement savings. This is certainly not within the scope of what superannuation was meant to be. He is currently grappling with the challenge of reclaiming what is rightfully his. Despite his young age, the lack of provided superannuation will significantly affect his future, and he is a sad reminder of why it's important to preserve savings to deliver income for a dignified retirement. This must be done alongside government support in an equitable and sustainable way.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The introduction of the Superannuation (Objective) Bill 2023 by this government marks a significant legislative effort. The primary intent of the bill is to establish a clear and precise objective for superannuation within the legal framework. It is meant to serve as a guiding principle for future governments, regulatory bodies, industry stakeholders and the broader community. Every Australian needs to be able to rely on their super after years and years of hard work, and the significance of this bill extends not only to Australia as a whole but also to the communities in my electorate of Adelaide. They rightfully want assistance in redeeming and understanding their rights within the super landscape. Each time I speak with a constituent, I am reminded of how important the superannuation system is and how important it is to put money aside to ensure that there are some funds there when you retire.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We all know that the superannuation system was subjected to different misappropriations by preceding administrations. We recall clearly what happened in 2015 when the then coalition government chopped some of the increases that were meant to be made to super and that the former Labor government had legislated for. I recall very clearly at the time, even though I wasn't in this place then, the Treasurer, Mr Hockey, saying that it would be better as an increase in wages to workers instead of going into their super. I think it was about 1½ per cent that we were meant to increase it by. I was working for the ASU—the Australian Services Union—at the time, and every time I was negotiating an EDA I would raise those exact words from the then Treasurer. I've got to tell you: not one person, not one employer, increased the wages—</span>

What a fantastic achievement for this small business, taking it up to the best in the business every single day. The Buckingham team can now lay claim to having the best lamb sausages on the mainland, because the winner was actually from Tasmania. That's a great achievement for the Buckingham team.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The secret to their sausages—their very acclaimed sausages—is simple: fresh, local produce. That's evident every time I visit and see the absolutely mouth-watering display of unique offerings in their fridges there to choose from. It's actually a really big decision—what you're going to buy to cook. It's no wonder that their sausages are some of the most popular products—they sell about 80 kilos a week. There are 15 different types of sausages to choose from, including this wonderful, award-winning lamb sausage.</span>

Part owners Michael Henderson and Sean Baker are eyeing the top spot at the next Sausage King competition, which begins later in the year.

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Solomon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:01</span>):  I rise to pay tribute to Warrant Officer Class 1 Raymond John Raddatz OAM, otherwise known as John or 'Ratz' or just 'JR'. He was born in Nambour and he served in the Australian Army with great distinction from 1965 to 2002.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 1969-70 John completed a tour of duty in South Vietnam as a section gun group leader in 12 Platoon, Delta Company, 6th Battalion of the Royal Australian Regiment. In 1975, he transferred out of infantry into the Royal Australian Engineers corps, and he deployed in Namibia with the UN Transition Assistance Group as a member of a mine-clearing team. In 1983, John played a foundational role redeveloping the explosive ordnance disposal, or EOD, capability, which of course became a very important frontline resource in the Iraq and Afghanistan wars to come.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">John was highly regarded by soldiers and officers alike, maintaining the highest professional standards. As a warrant officer class 1, John held several senior RSM positions, including RSM of the 6th Brigade in Brisbane. He served in UN mine action teams in several African countries and other countries around the world.</span>

One hundred and thirteen candidates stood for 46 positions in six local regions. Once elected, each committee will choose two representatives to sit on the state voice, which will be given the opportunity twice a year to present to parliament. The government estimates that 30,000 were eligible to vote, but, as there is no electoral roll which indicates a person's indigeneity, this figure can be no more than a guess. Astonishingly, there was no requirement or mechanism to prove an Indigenous heritage in order to cast a vote.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The state's Attorney-General and Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, Kyam Maher, stated: 'There is nothing to fear with the SA First Nations voice to parliament. It will have an advisory role with no power to coerce parliament on anything.' As there has been no indication of how much this new body will cost to run, and given its lack of power, one would be forgiven for wondering, perhaps, what on earth it is all about. The minister has said we need not fear the Indigenous vote on development; however, given the green activists are aligning themselves with Indigenous groups to hold up projects all over Australia, perhaps that is not even relevant. For evidence of this, I reference the Santos projects at Narrabri and Barossa, the Woodside Scarborough development and Kimba's radioactive waste management facility, which have all been delayed or scuttled by what looks like an existing veto.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Makin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:04</span>):  The interim decision by China that the tariffs on Australian wine are no longer necessary provides a ray of hope to Australian wine growers, who since 2020 have been struggling to sell their produce. With the imposition of the higher tariffs by China in 2020, after a breakdown in diplomatic relations with China under the last coalition government, Australian wine exports fell from almost $1.2 billion in 2019 to just $8 million in 2022. For South Australian growers and winemakers, who account for over 50 per cent of Australian wine production, the collapse of the China market was devastating, with last year's South Australian wine exports to China plummeting to just $4.9 million. After three years of low prices or no sales at all, many South Australian growers are struggling to survive and may even be facing bankruptcy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finding sufficient new markets to offset wine sales to China has not been possible, which is why rebuilding trade relations with China has been a priority for the foreign minister, Senator Penny Wong, and the trade minister, Senator Don Farrell. China's interim decision will not undo the hardship caused to growers over the past three years, but, if the lifting of the tariffs becomes permanent when the final decision is made in the coming fortnight, it will provide much-needed hope for the Australian wine industry.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mackellar</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:06</span>):  The Be Centre in Warriewood, in my electorate of Mackellar, is one of the largest specialist play-therapy centres in the world. We are very fortunate to have it as it is leading the way when it comes to supporting young children's mental health in Australia. The Be Centre is a not-for-profit organisation that specialises in early intervention for children impacted by trauma. Uniquely, it uses play based therapy, which is a developmentally responsive mental health intervention for children aged three to 12 years. Play therapy is an important intervention which allows children to express and process what they otherwise would not be able to verbalise.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Evidence from the UK and US shows that children who undergo play therapy benefit from greater self-awareness, greater self-regulation and improvements in social behaviour. They also have reductions in emotional distress and hyperactivity. Importantly, it is a treatment that can prevent trauma or mental distress in children from becoming chronic. With 50 per cent of all mental illness beginning by the age of 14, early intervention is critical, but, currently, play based therapy cannot be accessed under Medicare in Australia. Prevention is always better than cure, which is why in my 2024 budget submission I've advocated for the federal government to extend the Better Access to mental health care initiative to include child centred play therapy.</span>

I would like to thank the president of the Australian Chinese Buddhist Society, James Chan, and Secretary Vincent Kong for their invitation and support of the community. Last week I attended an iftar dinner hosted by the ICPA, one of many I'm looking forward to attending during the month of Ramadan. My community is also home to one of the largest Mandaean diasporas in the world, and I wish them a blessed Parwanaya, which began on the weekend. I look forward to celebrating and marking many more dates over the next few months, from Easter, Holi, Eid and many more. Thank you to everyone that invites me to these events.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ryan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:09</span>):  Recently it was reported that people fleeing Gaza to come to Australia are having their visas cancelled mid-flight. I can't fathom how anyone in this government can defend their decision to cancel visas of Palestinian people escaping genocide in Gaza. I frankly don't understand how they can sleep at night or look a fellow human in the eye. I'm sorry, but this is a new low for our government. These people had their visas approved. The government had told them to apply. Many paid thousands of dollars and waited in horrific conditions just to cross the border into Egypt, knowing that they may never, ever return, only to have their Australian visas cancelled with no explanation. They're stuck in Egypt or in other third countries. It's not clear how long they can stay there or whether they can go back to Gaza. What terror they must be experiencing. They have escaped a genocide only to be caught in a nightmare limbo. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Meanwhile, 12,000 children have been murdered by Israel. People seeking aid from food trucks have been massacred. Labor is complicit in this genocide. They should be banning arms shipments from Australia to Israel. They should be supporting South Africa's case at the ICJ. They should be publicly condemning Israel, but instead they're cancelling the visas of people seeking safety—disgraceful.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today I speak in relation to NAPLAN, the national assessment program, which is a literacy and numeracy assessment for primary students in years 3 and 5 and secondary students in years 7 and 9. NAPLAN commenced last week, and I want to send my very best wishes to all the students in Pearce and Australia wide who are taking part and to their teachers, who do an amazing job. It's important to regularly check how well students are learning the essential skills of reading, writing and numeracy as they progress throughout their school years. NAPLAN assesses the literacy and numeracy skills that students are learning through the school curriculum, and it allows parents and carers an opportunity to see how their children are progressing.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important to know that NAPLAN is just one aspect of a school's assessment and reporting process. It does not replace ongoing assessments made by teachers about student performances. All students have the opportunity to participate in the program, which takes into consideration students with disabilities who have diverse functional abilities and needs. I congratulate all those students and teachers and wish them all the very best for NAPLAN.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Sturt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:12</span>):  I would like to sincerely thank the Coordinating Italian Committee, CIC SA, who hosted me at their headquarters in Stepney in my electorate last week. They provide a very vital service to the Italian community, and particularly to the ageing Italian community, in my electorate. I'm very proud to have the largest Italian community of any electorate in the country. Some of the first significant Italian migrations came in the years after the Second World War. Members of that generation, of course, now are entering into aged care, and they need the community support around them, particularly language-specific support at times. CIC are a fantastic organisation that have been doing that for decades, and demand for their service is ever growing. I strongly urge that we give them all the support that we can.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am pleased to have the aged-care minister here opposite me, and I genuinely look forward to an opportunity to engage and work with her on organisations like CIC, because they do get support from the Commonwealth. I'm sure she agrees that organisations like CIC do a fantastic job. They are volunteers that are also taking an enormous burden off a system that would have to pick up the slack if they didn't exist and do the excellent hard work that they do. Thank you to CIC for the service that they provide to my community, and I very much look forward to supporting them well into the future. </span>

I was reminded that, as the first female member of parliament representing Holt, I had a heavy weight on my shoulders. I was reminded of the responsibility of leading by example, of showing these future leaders that one day they too can represent our wonderful community. As I reflected on their excitement, I understood the role women in leadership play in not only shaping policies and initiatives that promote inclusivity but also showing that inclusivity is possible and achievable. As we advocate for equality and strive to break down barriers, our influence trickles down and inspires young girls like those at Cranbourne Secondary College to lead.</span>

This is a time when we celebrate the invaluable contributions of our older citizens to our local communities. I want to highlight two remarkable individuals from my electorate of Hume: Jean Lloyd and Ray Strong.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Jean Lloyd was named Goulburn Mulwaree's Senior of the Year just last week. She has spent decades volunteering with organisations like Goulburn Legacy, Meals on Wheels and the Lions Club. What drives Jean is simple: it's people; it's the local community. She finds fulfilment in improving someone's day every day; making a life a little bit easier; listening to their fascinating stories; leading by example; and rallying volunteers to join her in initiatives like the Goulburn Legacy Lodge committee, where they provide essential support to seniors in their community. I would like to congratulate the Goulburn Legacy Lodge committee as well, because they were recognised as senior group of the year at last week's celebration.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also like to acknowledge finalist Ray Strong, who was recognised for his tireless work raising money for Goulburn's Lions Club. He was also recognised for his assistance with the Voice of Youth competition and help during Legacy Week as a reserve member. Those of us who represent regional towns and rural areas know how, in every town, a few people make a huge difference. They are left doing an enormous amount of work, and Jean and Ray are wonderful examples of just that.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canberra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:16</span>):  Coeliac Awareness Week is 13 to 20 March. Coeliac disease is an autoimmune disease that is triggered by gluten, which is found in wheat, rye, barley and oats—so many of our staple foods—and causes damage to the small intestine. The only treatment for coeliac disease is to eat a gluten-free diet for the rest of your life. Around one in 70 Australians have coeliac disease, yet it remains significantly underdiagnosed, with around 80 per cent of coeliacs not being diagnosed. Common symptoms of coeliac disease are abdominal pain, bloating or nausea. But this year Coeliac Australia is encouraging people to look beyond the gut and think about the other symptoms of coeliac disease that do not necessarily impact their digestive system. Things like brain fog, tiredness, fertility issues, hair loss or skin rashes could all be symptoms of coeliac disease. If left untreated it can lead to osteoporosis, infertility, mental health issues or cancer. For Australians living with coeliac disease, it is a limiting disease. They face stress about eating food prepared by others, potential effects of accidentally consuming gluten and a lack of available safe food options. This is a serious illness, and I encourage anyone with any of these symptoms to talk to their GP.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wannon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:18</span>):  Last month, there was a devastating fire in my electorate, in the township of Pomonal. Forty-six houses were burnt to the ground in a community of 350. On average that means that literally a third of the town lost its housing. One of the things that occurred on the day when the fire hit—which often occurs when there's a fire, and which occurs a lot in regional and rural Australia—was the lack of telecommunication services. There was a community meeting held days after the tragic fire, and the town wanted to know when there would be an improvement in telecommunication services. After that meeting, I took the cause up with Telstra, and I'm pleased to be able to say to the community today that Telstra are now going to upgrade the telecommunication base station on Mount William, with the hope of being able to improve telecommunication services into Pomonal. They have an Optus tower, and, with this latest development from Telstra, the hope is that the community will now be able to use both Optus and Telstra. Hopefully we won't have disasters like this in the near future, but, if we do, people will be able to rely on their telecommunication services.</span>

This government's cost-of-living tax cuts will soon ensure that every Australian will keep more of what they earn. Our tax cuts are good for middle Australia, good for women, good for helping with cost-of-living pressures, good for labour supply and good for the economy. Some 82,000 taxpayers will now be seeing an average tax cut of $1,800 per year, and some 68,000 taxpayers will now be better off under these new tax changes.</span>

On top of this, the government will now pay superannuation on its Paid Parental Leave scheme from 1 July next year. This will benefit about 180,000 families annually, ensuring Australians can have strong super balances and enjoy a comfortable retirement and fixing a long-term anomaly in superannuation treatment.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Herbert</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:21</span>):  Crime is the No. 1 issue facing the residents of Townsville. Last night, homes were broken into, cars were stolen and violence took place on our streets, and tonight and tomorrow night these things will happen again. Earlier this month, a group of 16-year-old girls went to the movies, and, on their way in, before they had even purchased a ticket or bought popcorn, a group of eight juvenile criminals cornered them. They violently beat two of the young girls, punching them in the back of the head, kicking them and pushing them to the ground. I know this because one of the offenders filmed the violent bashing and posted it to Instagram with the words, 'My girls bashed you.' Youth criminals are taking to social media to gain online notoriety. They are promoting their crimes, glorifying their disgusting behaviour and recruiting the next generation so the cycle continues. It has to stop.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The federal coalition is introducing a private member's bill that will make it illegal to post criminal activity online. Townsville has been under siege by violent youth criminals for far too long, and we've had enough. Only the state government MPs can change the state law. The weak Queensland state Labor government refuses to remove from the Youth Justice Act the principle that detention should be a last resort. To break this cycle, we must remove content that glorifies violence, break-ins and the stealing of cars. We must punish bad behaviour, and I strongly encourage the Albanese Labor government to support this bill and allow us to fix the issue that continues to plague our city and the nation. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macquarie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:22</span>):  If you're having a baby after 1 July this year, you'll be the first to benefit from the changes to paid parental leave that passed through the Senate today. There's an extra two weeks of leave, which increases every year so there will be a full six months of paid parental leave by July 2026. More than 180,000 families will benefit annually, including mums and dads in Macquarie. This gives families more paid leave and more flexibility and is a tangible way to help people with the costs of growing their family. We've increased the number of weeks reserved for each parent on a 'use it or lose it' basis to four weeks to encourage greater sharing of care. We're also providing more flexibility by upping the amount of leave both parents can take at the same time from two weeks to four weeks. It's important to know you don't have to wait until after your baby is born to make your claim. Expecting parents can pre-claim from March 26. These changes deliver the commitment we made back in the October 2022 budget, and they complement our latest improvement, which we announced earlier this month: to pay superannuation on paid parental leave from 1 July 2025. It's the biggest boost to paid parental leave since it was created in 2011 by the former Labor government. It's good for women, it's good for business and it's great for the economy.</span>

Late last month, Perentie Brewing Co took out an impressive eight awards at the esteemed Royal Queensland Beer Awards, including the top gong, Champion Lager, for its Pure Crisp brew. Showcasing Australia's best in the industry, the Royal Queensland Beer Awards is one of Australia's most prestigious beer awards, unearthing the nation's top beer products. With more than 600 entries from 87 breweries across 18 categories, these awards have solidified Perentie's position as a specialist in authentic lager beers. Perentie's Summer Dry, Pure Haze and Komodo Black were also awarded high honours in their nominated categories. This is after having their doors open for only a few months before Christmas, and thanks to the hard work of founder Kenton Campbell and his whole crew. Kenton's vision to create a beer house honouring the traditional German lager brewing process has been a tremendous success. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Perentie Brewing is located in my electorate and is part of the greater complex of the Distillery Road Market and the Sugar Creek Smokehouse, and the Zarraffa's Coffee headquarters. It's a great local institution. All of my colleagues are always welcome to come and have a beer at Perentie Brewing. I can attest, firsthand, that it is a great drop and is well enjoyed on a Friday afternoon.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bennelong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:25</span>):  The great Liberal electric vehicle scare campaign of 2024 rolls on. Unperturbed by their failure to win back Dunkley, we've since seen the Liberal Party double-down on their misguided opposition to Australians paying less for fuel. Let's not forget the last time the Liberals tried to scare us off fuel-efficient cars. They said that electric vehicles were going to ruin the weekend. Now we're being told that there's a great big new tax on cars on its way, which those who read the department's analysis would know is absolute rubbish. Let's not just take their word for it. I'll read out a headline from the RMIT ABC Fact Check website, released on Friday 15 March. It reads: 'Peter Dutton says Labor's proposed fuel efficiency standards constitute a ute or family car tax. Is that correct? … No, Labor is not taxing the family car.' I mean, that's pretty conclusive. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor wants people to pay less for fuel when they buy a new car. Labor wants motorists to have a choice of the best technology when they buy a new car. Labor wants to reduce emissions in the transport sector. In terms of developed economies, it is only Australia and Russia that have no standards for new vehicles. Unlike the Russians and the Liberals, we are a government that's committed to climate action, to a transition to renewables and now to a new vehicles emissions standard.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Deakin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:27</span>):  I'm very pleased to say that one of the projects that survived the so-called Labor infrastructure review was the Ringwood multilevel car park, which we kicked off in my electorate last week. With a generous and additional 340 spaces, residents who use Ringwood station in my electorate will finally be able to get a car park. At the moment you can't get a car park at Ringwood station any time after seven o'clock. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We heard from the Labor Party for years that it was improper to build new multilevel car parks at train stations. They did everything they could to stop this project going ahead. But I want to congratulate the residents in my electorate for fighting hard to make sure that we sent the government a strong message that this infrastructure was vitally important for our electorate. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly, we've seen numerous other projects in our local community cancelled by this government, whether it be the Tortice Drive intersection upgrade or the $50 million Dorset Road upgrade—a range of projects throughout the eastern suburbs, not only in my electorate but also in the Casey electorate and the Menzies electorate. It just shows how much contempt this government has for residents in the eastern suburbs. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But it is the community, because of their support for this project, that get the credit. I am looking forward to the 340 new spaces at Ringwood train station.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fraser</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:28</span>):  One of the most famous books on negotiation is <span style="font-style:italic;">Getting to Yes: Negotiating Agreement Without Giving In</span>. The opposition has perfected a parallel political manual, 'Getting to No: Negotiating Disagreement through Knee-Jerk Ideology'. In the famous book, the first principle is: separate the people from the problem. The opposition spends all their time talking about people and playing the person, not the ball. No matter what issue is raised in this place, it's a resounding 'no' and a heap of personal invective. Where, throughout this term, has there been a single political idea from those opposite other than getting people to empty their superannuation accounts to get a home to live in? </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The next principle is: use objective criteria. Those opposite use the empty rhetoric of tax reform and aspiration, but look at the objective stats: 84 per cent of people are better off under our revised tax arrangements, and every single person gets a tax cut. In addition, seven deciles of people get lower average tax rates over the coming decade, or less bracket creep. Those are people with aspirations. They're the real aspirational people—it's not just those in the top one per cent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's also: invent options for mutual gain. Our revamped tax arrangements will see more than 90,000 extra hours worked per week, mostly by women. That's real win-win reform. Those opposite recoil. Don't buy the book those opposite are selling. It won't be a bestseller. It's not worth the paper it's written on.</span>

I know that people throughout the parliament will have deb balls in their electorates. It's something that we honour the tradition of in country Australia. On Saturday night I went to the Ganmain Debutante Ball. It's one of the biggest fundraisers for St Brendan's Primary School. It was great to see the debs: Olivia Gardiner partnered by Hugh Nowlan, Summer Griffiths partnered by Noah Hatty, Lacey Harris—Joe O'Connor partnered her—and Eva Lucas partnered by Lucas Hatty. It was fantastic to see those young debs coming out into society. It's a fantastic tradition. I see nods from those opposite because they know just how important this tradition is for country Australia and for country communities. May this tradition long continue into the future.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ALBANESE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grayndler</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Prime Minister</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:33</span>):  I am delighted to welcome the new member for Dunkley and the newest member of our Labor government, Jodie Belyea. Jodie, congratulations. This is truly a moment in your life that you will never forget. The excitement and the pride that you feel today is shared by everyone who has been part of your journey to get here: your wonderful family, whom I have got to know; your campaign staff; all the people who believed in you—including, of course, our beloved friend the remarkable Peta Murphy, the former member for Dunkley.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This was a by-election that no one wanted to happen. Today, we remind ourselves of the extraordinary loss that this parliament had and that the community of Dunkley suffered from, but particularly Peta Murphy's family, her beloved husband, Rod, and others. Peta Murphy did some fantastic things as the member for Dunkley, including recruiting Jodie to the Labor Party. I know I speak for everyone in this chamber when I say it is hard to imagine a greater compliment than being selected by Peta Murphy to serve the community that she loved so deeply.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The electorate of Dunkley is named after Louisa Dunkley, a champion for equal pay for women, and it is fitting that its newest member has dedicated so much of her working life to supporting women in that local community, including as the founder of Women's Spirit. Jodie, while Peta Murphy wanted you to be her successor as the member for Dunkley, of course the ultimate decision belonged, as it always does, to the people of your local community. On 2 March, the people of Dunkley put their trust in you to be their champion—and I must say that it did give me, the Treasurer and the Minister for Skills and Training the birthday gift that we did want, that we did ask for.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, to use each and every day you spend in this place in this role, you will be able to make a positive difference to people's lives. I know that that is the focus that you will bring to the special honour, the great privilege and, above all, the solemn responsibility that you take up today as the member for Dunkley. We're delighted to welcome you to the parliament, to the caucus and to our Labor government—reinforcing, as you will notice in the caucus room, a majority of women. May this be the first of many sitting weeks and the beginning of many years of service as the member for Dunkley. I wish you all the very best and congratulations once again.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">That the House record its deep regret at the death, on 29 February 2024, of Senator Linda White, Senator for Victoria since 2022, place on record its appreciation of her lifelong commitment to improving the lives of Australians, her dedication to public service, and offer its deepest sympathy to her family in their bereavement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week I had the sad honour of joining hundreds of other mourners to farewell our dear friend Senator Linda White. We gathered in the Australian Centre for the Moving Image in Melbourne, a deeply fitting place to celebrate the life of someone who loved the arts and understood why they matter so much in our personal lives and in our collective life as a nation. The room that afternoon rang to the sound of opera, it was uplifted by strains of 'Solidarity Forever' and, above all, it glowed with love. It was so perfectly Linda. We heard tributes to Linda's contributions not just as a senator and trade unionist but as an ACMI board member, a trustee of the Melbourne Cricket Ground and the botanic gardens, and so much more.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Linda White was taken from us far too soon, yet what will long outlast our sadness is our pride in all that she was and all that she did. Linda was a beloved friend and a valued colleague. We reflect on her achievements as a Labor senator and to all her efforts over decades across the wider labour movement as someone who saw every worker as a partner in the success of a business. We pay tribute to a formidable supporter of working Australians, particularly women.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Linda was always ready for a challenge. At a time when the Melbourne Law School was largely male, she became the second-ever female president of the law student society. As a young lawyer, she played her part in tackling injustices that were only just beginning to be dragged into the light, including police corruption and child sexual abuse in the clergy. In her time at the Australian Services Union, she rose to assistant national secretary, and her legacy is everywhere, from protecting workers' entitlements in the Ansett collapse and the decade-long battle that ensued, to fighting for the right to income for members affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">She was, rightly, proud of her role in the ASU, putting the issue of women's unequal superannuation outcomes on the map. The government's International Women's Day announcement that super will be paid on government paid parental leave is just one important testament to her efforts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the longest-serving woman on the National Executive of the ALP, Australia's oldest political party, she was central to the affirmative action reforms which led to my government being the first in Australian history with a majority of female members. Linda was forthright, outspoken and true to her values. She was loyal and called it as she saw it. She was trusted and respected by all in what can be a tough arena.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The day that Linda entered the parliament was a good day for the Australian Labor Party, for the Senate, but, more importantly, for the nation. A perfect picture of the new senator was provided by her extraordinary and varied group of supporters packing out the public gallery for her first speech to the Senate. What they heard that day was someone with a full appreciation of the privilege and the responsibility of elected office and how the need to listen is as powerful as the need to act. In Linda's words:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">There's no doubt in my mind that governments change lives, that strong progressive Labor governments change them for the better. But sometimes governments need a helping hand to stay on track. As I often say, sometimes we need someone else to show us our best selves.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly, Linda was not destined to be in the Senate for long, but she made powerful use of the brief time she had, making a profound impact on matters of significance, including the National Anti-Corruption Commission, better access to superannuation for women and the important check on executive power, the Scrutiny of Delegated Legislation Committee. She may well have been the most senior new backbencher to have ever existed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a senator for Victoria, Linda's love for the state blossomed. She became an active voice in caucus and the parliament for agriculture and the regions. She loved the relationships she was developing with her constituents. Linda believed in a better, fairer and more compassionate Australia. Even her love of the arts, good food and beautiful gardens was energised by her belief that good things in life should be available to everyone—bread, and roses too. On behalf of the Australian government and the Labor family I offer my deepest condolences to Linda's beloved brother Michael and sister-in-law Julie and to the countless activists she mentored, especially women across the labour movement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I visited her in hospital weeks before her passing, Linda was in good spirits. She was focused on the Dunkley by-election and even apologised for not being on the ground campaigning. She had so much more to do, and I take the opportunity to thank the Leader of the Opposition for the discreet way in which Linda's health issues were handled in this place and in the other. Linda was determined to not let people know just how sick she was, and very few people were aware, which is why her passing has come as such a shock to so many in the Labor family. It says a lot about her and her character that she didn't want people to make a fuss. She just dealt with it as the strong, brave, extraordinary person she was.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Like the rest of the Labor family, I will miss her enormously, as a generous colleague and a source of advice but, most importantly, as a very dear friend. Linda White made a positive difference. She changed the lives of so many others for the better every single day of her working life. In her words, 'Getting justice for people has dominated my working life.' She lived her life well and she lived it true to her values. May Linda White rest in peace.</span>

As the Prime Minister pointed out, he and I had a number of conversations in relation to this matter, and I know that he, along with the whole Labor family, is feeling the loss acutely, and his respect was evident in every word that he uttered to me—his friendship and his adoration of Linda—and I pass my condolences on to the Prime Minister and to the Labor Party.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Prime Minister, as leaders of our respective parties, we have the great privilege to lead this House in paying tribute to those who have served and shaped our nation. These are important moments. They're poignant moments. And some condolences are harder to deliver than others. I commend you, Prime Minister, as I say, for your words.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">During the time in which we all serve in this place, we all see many colleagues exit the political arena. Some call time on their careers. Others leave in the defeat which comes from the democratic process. But in both cases our former colleagues get to know a life away from politics, and that life affords time for reflection, time for new opportunities, and, most importantly, more time with those whom we love and cherish the most.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Death is, of course, the most unfair exit from this place because death deprives our colleagues of these times. Our hearts break whenever fate thrusts an unfair exit on our fellow parliamentarians, regardless of their political stripes. In this 47th Parliament, fate has thrust unfair exits on Jim Molan, Peta Murphy and now on Linda White.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Linda's maiden speech, she said she was saving many stories for her memoirs, and, while those stories will sadly not be written, Linda's story will live on in the memories of her colleagues and friends, especially those opposite me. In that same speech, Linda promised that no-one would be left wondering what she thought, and she certainly lived up to that promise. She spoke her mind with courage. She never held back on espousing her convictions. And so there was never any ambiguity when it came to knowing what made Linda White tick. Linda was driven by the causes of social justice and inclusion. She was a campaigner for women's rights, economic empowerment and equity in the workplace. She was not afraid to express her belief in big government or advocate for market intervention. And, most of all, she was a champion of the unions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Linda joined the union movement as a 20-year-old. To pay her way through university, she started working at McDonald's. She felt that her employer was not offering its adult workforce enough shifts. And so she became a union delegate, to petition her managers for better conditions. Although Linda was ultimately unsuccessful in her efforts, those events shaped her life. Linda 'felt the power of collectivism for the first time', as she put it. Union organising and collective action became her driving force.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Linda described her career as 'a series of experiences, decisions and opportunities', some within her control and some not. Fresh from university, the young Linda couldn't quite land a union job; instead, she found herself working for Maurice Blackburn Lawyers—from articled clerk to admired senior associate. Linda acknowledged that she had 'a dream run' during her decade at the firm. She helped clients through their darkest hours and supported victims of sexual abuse and assault.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite the long hours working in the legal profession, Linda continued to recruit and organise for the union movement. Her efforts did not go unnoticed, especially by the erudite Lindsay Tanner. Linda was thrilled to finally land a union job in the Victorian branch of the ASU. Within a year, she'd been promoted to the national office as Assistant National Secretary.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the course of the next quarter of a century, Linda would distinguish herself through her work. She became a staunch defender of the rights of workers in the airline industry, as the Prime Minister noted earlier. She was the lead negotiator for enterprise agreements at Qantas and secured the inclusion of paid parental and domestic violence leave. After Ansett's collapse in 2001, Linda fought for 10 years to help secure some $760 million in compensation for workers who'd lost their jobs. Indeed, last September, on the Senate floor, Linda proudly wore the wings given to her by a former Ansett female flight attendant.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another victory dear to Linda's heart was when she helped to secure equal pay for 200,000 women working in the social, community and disability services sector. Linda said: 'Getting justice for people has dominated my working life.' Justice fuelled Linda's sense of duty. Not surprisingly, when she was elected as a senator for Victoria in 2022, Linda threw herself headfirst into issues relating to justice. She spoke of the differences in superannuation savings between men and women. She wanted to continue the work of the National Redress Scheme. And, most significantly, she was instrumental in setting up the National Anti-Corruption Commission, which she described as 'a new compact with the Australian people'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Linda of course had many friends in many circles. She was a patron of film, of art and of cricket. She found joy in life, from chatting about the latest releases in her book club to discussing motorsport with her brother.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Linda said: 'Australian democracy is more fragile than we realise,' and today, in commemorating Linda White, we are also reminded of the fragility of life itself. On behalf of the coalition, I offer my heartfelt condolences to Linda's family, especially her brother, Michael, and his wife, Julie, and to Linda's friends and colleagues. May Linda White rest in peace.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HWQ" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr MARLES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Corio</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Defence</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:49</span>):  Today we herald an unsung giant. For those of us who have been engaged in the engine room of our party, the unions or the broader labour movement over the last 30 years, we had the opportunity to watch, engage, tussle with and ultimately admire Linda White. The engine room is where Linda spent the bulk of her career, out of the limelight and behind the scenes, dealing with difficult issues where tireless service is demanded and where big decisions are made.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The vital statistics of Linda's career say it all: 25 years as the assistant national secretary of the Australian Services Union; 15 years on the ACTU executive; 10 years as an ACTU vice-president, 20 years on the ALP national executive—as the Prime Minister said, the longest-serving woman on that body—and nine years on the national executive committee. At the ASU, Linda particularly championed the rights of clerical workers—the vast majority of whom are women. Because of Linda there are now thousands of women in this country who are paid more and who enjoy conditions of employment such as paid parental leave which enable them to balance work and family much better. They are the beneficiaries of her work, but so is our nation. The innate dignity of their work, which Linda always understood, because of her work, is now much better honoured in the Australian workplace.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the ALP, Linda brought an eye to detail to finances, to government and to administration. That our party is well run is wholly unremarkable, but everybody in this chamber knows that when the reverse is the case it can be disastrous. I think Linda's greatest achievement is her commitment to her championing of her defence of the ALP's affirmative-action targets. The legacy of her work is sitting behind me now: a caucus which is now made up of equal numbers of men and women—in fact, slightly more women than men. Having been a member of this caucus since 2007, I cannot overstate how much better it is that we are a caucus which properly represents those who vote for us. We are able to harness the full talent of our base. The issues that we speak about, and the way in which we speak about them, are completely different, and the outcomes are there for everyone.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It has to be said that in my time in engaging with Linda by and large I sat across the table, and I can attest firsthand that Linda was tough. When there were issues that mattered to her, it was like wrestling with a wall; she just didn't move. Yet while it might have been difficult to debate with Linda, when there were difficult issues, I found myself, as so many others did, instinctively looking to Linda to make sure that, collectively, we were getting the answer right. When she was in the minority, she, as Rachel Griffiths so beautifully put it in that wonderful service last Thursday, held her dissent with grace and registered it, and then we all moved on as one.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I knew Linda for 25 years, but as I listened to those speeches last Thursday it occurred to me that there was so much about Linda that I didn't know: her involvement in and love of the theatre and the arts; her love of the MCG; and her fun and abidingly loyal friendships with those in her inner circle. I came away from last Thursday, to be honest, wishing I had known Linda better. In that, I take away a lesson.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Towards the end of last year I had the opportunity to ask Linda how she was enjoying being in the Senate. She was absolutely loving it—a closer scrutiny of the laws that we make, a deeper inquiry into the impact that those laws have. If you take a step back and you look at Linda's life, she was born to be a senator—which makes it all the more tragic that her time in the Senate was cut so short. But I take solace that, in these last few years, Linda finally received the recognition that she deserved and that she left this world doing a job that she loved on behalf of a party that she loved even more. Vale, Linda White.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Maranoa</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Nationals</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:55</span>):  On behalf of the Nationals, it's with a heavy heart and deep regret that I extend our party's condolences to family, friends, colleagues and the entire Labor family of Linda White. With the tragedy of Senator Linda White's sudden loss of life, which was cut far too short, we will remember a woman who proudly dedicated herself to the Labor Party and the union movement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">She was always tenacious in what she believed in because her values and her personal convictions were rock solid. They were unshakeable. She was a strong advocate for social justice and economic fairness, especially for women. She was someone who cared deeply about giving every Australian worker a fair go, and throughout a long and accomplished professional career as a solicitor, as the assistant national secretary of the Australian Services Union, as vice-president of the ACTU, as the longest serving woman on the National Executive of the ALP and, of course, as a Labor senator, Linda demonstrated a formidable and effective capacity to translate her core underlying principles into real and decisive action—action that made a real difference and action that left a legacy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We can confidently reflect that outcomes such as the equal pay case for 200,000 non-government, social and community workers in 2012 would not have been possible without Linda's powerful advocacy as a union secretary. Admirably, Linda always had a passion for helping the disadvantaged, and this especially shone through during her time as a lawyer, when she proved herself to be a committed and trusted supporter for the victims and survivors of institutional child sexual abuse.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Although her time serving in the Senate was unfortunately brief, her contribution was significant. As a parliamentarian, she was a strong believer in the best traditions of Australian democracy and she served with distinction as chair of the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Delegated Legislation. Importantly, Linda also had a sharp knowledge and keen interest in many issues impacting regional, rural and remote Australia. Alongside the member for Dawson, she was co-chair of the Parliamentary Friends of Biosecurity, while she was also a leading member of the rural and regional affairs and transport Senate standing committee.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we pay tribute to the memory of Senator Linda White, we will remember a woman of strength, a woman of character, a woman who was shaped and defined by her values and convictions and a woman who has left a wonderful legacy in the Australian Labor Party and our nation's parliament. May she rest in peace.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="243609" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GILES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Scullin</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:57</span>):  Linda White only served as a Victorian senator for less than two years, but Linda's impact on our national life, as well as on the trade union movement and the Australian Labor Party, is incalculable and indelible. It's written in this place. That the Albanese government is comprised of a majority of women is the work of thousands, of course, but Linda's steely resolve and unshakeable principle was a critical factor in turning values into action. Turning values into action is what Linda did as a lawyer, as a unionist, in the Labor Party and in the Senate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">She was both principled and pragmatic. She fought and fought hard for those values but always understood that empty rhetoric is just that—empty. She was a formidable advocate and negotiator because she always appreciated what the other side were trying to do. She saw the whole picture not to admire it but to put it right in the interests of working people and working women in particular. She lived a life of service on her terms, and we saw that in that beautiful memorial service, with stories of contribution told to a packed room at ACMI, a place she loved, along with vignettes that explained and explored her passions and complexities: from the MCG to a missed vocation in comedy production; from farmers markets to book club; and from the clerks reform group, which made the modern ASU, to managing Victorian Labor and administration.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Through a singular commitment to governance, whether in the national executive or, I suspect, that book club, she did things that brought her joy and things that mattered—hard things like fighting for justice for survivors of institutional abuse, delivering pay equity and securing the dignity and the livelihoods of workers stranded by the Ansett collapse. All of these involved Linda speaking truth to power. She would be pleased with the super changes announced last week, but she'd be asking straight away, 'What's next?' All of us who knew her knew that she would be direct and speaking truth to us whenever our actions didn't meet her expectations. She never took a backward step and never accepted anyone else doing so. She never forgot that our movement is, at its heart, concerned with human dignity. She cared for people deeply and always. As one example, when my electorate office had to be closed for security reasons, she personally kept in contact with the team there, sending a hamper and regularly checking in. It meant the world and it sums her up.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I began these remarks reflecting on the discrepancy between Linda's too short time in the Senate and her achievements. I want to end on this point too—not as a lament, because that isn't the Linda White way, but as a call to action for those of us who have the chance to make a difference to seize it with both hands as Linda did. She cared for neither title nor credit. She knew that there is never a moment to waste, and she didn't waste a single moment. As she said in her first speech to the Senate:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">For some people, their pathway in life is determined by the circumstances of their birth. Governments, however, have the power to open up new choices and opportunities that would otherwise remain out of reach. The power we have in this place to change lives is significant.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I miss Linda White—my comrade and my friend. I stand here as one of so many who loved her and as one who should have been clearer in expressing the depth of my debt to her. I'm thinking now of all that she did and how her influence lives on through the work of all of those she inspired, and especially of her wonderful staff—Ben Armstrong<span style="font-style:italic;">, </span>Ekta Mahal<span style="font-style:italic;">, </span>Amit Aalok<span style="font-style:italic;">, </span>Ned Lindenmayer and Ead Stokes—and of course her brother, Michael.

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Farrer</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Leader of the Opposition</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:01</span>):  I rise to contribute to this important condolence motion for Senator Linda White, who left us far too soon. Before I reflect on Linda and her career I would like to express my support for those opposite who have lost two strong Victorian women in a matter of months—with the loss of Peta Murphy being far too soon as well. We also cannot forget the loss of Senator Kimberley Kitching.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For those watching at home, this chamber and its antics, for better or worse, represent the way they think about Australian politics. But behind this chamber sits an army of people who drive forward the interests of those without a voice and who contribute to the work of political organisations. This work, conducted in the engine room of political parties, think tanks, community forums and meetings with workers and employers, can be underappreciated and go unremarked. There are those who toil for decades in these workhouses of public policy to advance a cause that changes lives but whose names never end up on the front page or across the bottom of our television screens.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Occasionally, though, these warriors enter this place. One of those individuals was Senator Linda White. Linda was an unashamed fighter for the Labor cause and for the cause of women in modern Australia. For her efforts as a woman and as an Australian, I am thankful. If anyone thought her elevation to the Senate was about making up the numbers, they were mistaken. She said in her first speech:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">People will always know where I stand, and already know that I'm not afraid of saying what's on my mind. I am not about to change the habits of a lifetime.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">…   …   … </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I am not here to make my name or build my career. I am immensely proud of the battles I have fought, the things I have achieved and the comrades I have made.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And battle she did in this place, just as she had as a student when she attended Melbourne University—the first in her family to do so, along with her brother, Michael. Battle she did as a union organiser for some of the lowest paid workers in Australia. Battle she did as a lawyer, representing workers who'd been let down by big business or abused by those who should have been there to support them. And battle she did as a leading Labor figure, behind the scenes for decades, fighting for a better deal for Australian women. While I didn't have a direct relationship with Senator White, in her experience I can find a common connection which tells something of her legacy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I was a young, aspiring pilot, men in suits in aviation companies sent me on my way because of my gender, reluctant to find pathways for women into the left-hand seat of a big passenger jet. Linda too would have run-ins with one of these companies—Ansett. I have to say that she came off better than I did. As Linda remarked in her first speech in the Senate:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Twenty-one years ago, next week,16,000 Australians at Ansett lost their jobs and a further 60,000 in companies that relied on Ansett lost theirs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In a testament to the role unions play in Australian society, her union—the Australian Services Union—stepped up for those workers. s a woman, I recognise the contributions Linda White made in pursuit of equal pay, in increasing the representation of women in this place and in taking on the dire challenge of women's economic security in retirement—something for which I share a strong commitment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the loss of Linda White, the Australian Labor Party has lost one of its closest friends and strongest fighters, the Australian union movement has lost one of its dearest comrades and loudest voices and Australia has lost one of its political warriors who knew where she stood and who wasn't going to budge an inch. I thank Linda White for her contribution to our national story and I thank her for the legacy she leaves.</span>

For the information of members, the condolence motion will take place on Thursday at the beginning of question time and Joel Fitzgibbon, our friend—I think all of our friend on a day like today—has asked me to really pass on his thanks to the chamber for giving him that respect to enable the family to then be here on Thursday. I thank the House.</span>

Last week, the minister claimed charges against hardcore criminals released from detention were being dropped due to a technical issue 'first identified late on Sunday 10 March'. Can the minister confirm that the legal issue was resolved by regulation on 8 December last year and that the minister's subsequent failure to reissue valid visas for more than three months has led directly to dangerous criminals being released from prison?</span>

I say to him and everyone here that there was no lapse in monitoring or coverage in respect of any individual. There was no change to our system of strict visa conditions. As he said in his question, the issue was a technical one, which we have resolved. The issue dates back to 2013 and existed for nearly a decade under the former government, who failed to fix it, and, worse, they are playing politics as we get on with the job of fixing up the mess.</span>

She knows, because the member for Dunkley has been talking to her constituents about the cost of living. In amongst a by-election campaign with trucks, with scare campaigns and with hundreds of thousands of dollars spent on advertising promoting fear, the member for Dunkley went out there and talked to people about the issues that really matter to them. She spoke to them about the cost of living and about how every taxpayer in Dunkley, and indeed every taxpayer right across Australia, will get a tax cut on 1 July. And, of course, with our tax cuts—</span>

To help those at home who can't hear the remarks going across the chamber: the average working woman in Dunkley will receive a $2,000-a-year tax cut—something disparaged and dismissed by those opposite—instead of getting precisely zero, which is what those opposite wanted for those workers in Dunkley earning under $45,000.

I would encourage him to be briefed on the real legal issues going to these issues so that he can make a constructive contribution to community safety. The fact that he chooses not to do so is frankly inexplicable, other than if he wants to retain some licence to free-range on issues that he knows he is in the wrong on. I can't get into the details of cases that are before the High Court, and I won't. But I will say this: the government believes that these individuals—those who are not cooperating with their removal—should be removed from Australia as a priority. While they are not, they should remain in immigration detention. This is a position we successfully defended before the Federal Court, and we will be vigorously defending this position before the High Court.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kingston</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Social Services</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:16</span>):  I'd like to thank the member for Aston for her question. The member for Aston, alongside every member of the Albanese Labor government wants people to earn more and keep more of what they earn. This is evident with our tax plan under which, from 1 July, every single taxpayer will be getting a tax cut, with 11.5 million Australians getting a bigger tax cut under Labor. But it's also evident in our historic paid parental leave legislation that has passed the parliament today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a result of our bill that has passed the Senate, from 1 July working families will have access to more paid parental leave, with the scheme expanding by two weeks each year until we reach 26 weeks—a full six months—in July 2026. When fully rolled out, that's over $5,000 more in the family budget for 180,000 families each year. This builds on important changes that we put in place from July 2023, including changes to give more families access to the payment and to make it easier for more parents to share care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm very pleased to see the strong support for Labor's historic reform from a diverse range of family, employer and community groups, unions, gender experts and economists. The ACTU has said the increase to 26 weeks was a great step forward for Australian parents, particularly working women, and a stark contrast to the policies and attitudes to women that we saw under the previous government. The Business Council of Australia said the expansion doesn't just help make a fairer society but is also a major economic reform which will help raise workforce participation and boost productivity. The Parenthood said that this is a significant improvement after no meaningful change to policy over the last decade. Equality Rights Alliance called these changes 'equality enabling' and a significant advance in the promotion of Australian women's economic security.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While, importantly, the government is supporting parents to take time off after the birth or adoption of their child, we're also taking action to minimise the impact on their retirement income by recently announcing that we will pay superannuation on government paid parental leave from July 2025. Not only is our government ensuring that women earn more and keep more of what they earn, but, by paying super on paid parental leave, we are ensuring that women will retire with more as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I hope that those opposite will join us to help us secure a better retirement as well as supporting women to earn more and keep more of what they earn. Unfortunately, I'm not holding my breath. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

That is why we have the Housing Australia Future Fund, which was opposed by those opposite, all the way through, and was opposed by the crossbenchers for a considerable period of time as well. But, eventually, they voted for it and allowed it through.</span>

This is going to be difficult—my point is: it's going to be difficult for you to make a point of order on relevance because of the way the question was phrased. You asked the question, 'Why is the government refusing to do something?' The government is answering, and the Prime Minister is answering, why that is. So I'll listen to you carefully—</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then, of course, we had the mishmash thought-bubble of a policy, announced just a week ago, that didn't actually take anything positive forward. Of course, the Greens party's 2002 election platform says this: 'This is why the Greens will establish a shared-equity ownership scheme'—the one they're not voting for in the Senate. But they do have a policy, because they have said, or the member for Griffith has, that you shouldn't have to win a lottery to have a secure home, but then, on the same website, he says, under 'An example of the Greens vision for housing in Brisbane': '2000 homes available to any Brisbane resident and assigned by lottery'.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">You can't take them seriously until they come up with a serious policy. You can't take them seriously unless they actually vote for what they said, at the last election, was their own policy. It's there in the Senate—the Help to Buy scheme. They should vote for it and get out of the way of good policy, which is what this housing minister and this government is proposing. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Rankin</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Treasurer</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:25</span>):  Thank you to the wonderful member for Gilmore for her question. The member for Gilmore understands that, despite the welcome and encouraging progress we have made on inflation, we know people are still under cost-of-living pressure, and that's why we've put so much time and effort since we've come to office into putting downward pressure on inflation in our economy. It's why we are pleased that quarterly inflation is now around a third of what we inherited from those opposite. A key reason for that is the way we've gone about managing the budget and the economy in the most responsible way. We have taken pressure off inflation by running a tight budget. We had the first surplus in 15 years; we turned a $78 billion deficit into a $22 billion surplus. We've seen the fastest and best recovery in the budget bottom line in the G20 comparing the year before we were elected to the year after we were elected. All of this is saving us on peak debt and interest costs. This is why the IMF, the Reserve Bank and others have pointed to the way that our budget policy is working hand in hand with monetary policy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's also why the OECD and the Australian Bureau of Statistics have gone out of their way to say that our policies are directly reducing inflation in our economy. That's because we designed our cost-of-living help to take pressure off inflation rather than add to it. We know the combination of energy bill relief, early childhood education reform and rent assistance took something like half a percentage point off inflation last year. We know our tax cuts won't add to the inflation problem either and won't add to deficits, but they will boost labour supply in our economy. As the minister said a moment ago and others have said—the Prime Minister—getting on top of inflation, getting real wages moving, rolling out the tax cuts and paying super on paid parental leave, as Linda White and Peta Murphy urged us to do—all this is about ensuring people earn more, keep more and retire with more as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reason why the new member for Dunkley sits on this side of the House and not on that side of the House is that we have a plan to ease cost-of-living pressures and they don't. If they had their way, inflation would still be galloping, wages would still be stagnating, there'd be debt and deficit as far as the eye could see and people would be working longer for less. The Dunkley by-election showed, and their behaviour today shows, their nasty negativity is no substitute for economic credibility. Almost two years in and they still have no alternatives except for the economic insanity of their uncosted nuclear fantasy. We reject their approach, we're managing the economy, we're managing the budget responsibly, we're making progress on inflation and real wages, we are repairing the budget, we are laying the foundations for growth and we are cleaning up the mess they left behind. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberAnswer">Ms WELLS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lilley</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Aged Care and Minister for Sport</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:31</span>):  I thank the member for Blair for his question. He is a tireless advocate for aged-care residents—like Margaret at Cabanda Care in Rosewood, where we visited together just last week. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government wants all Australian workers, including aged-care workers, to earn more and keep more of what they earn, because we know that strong, sustainable wage growth is part of the solution to cost-of-living challenges, not part of the problem. That is why we have backed aged-care workers in their fight for better wages at the Fair Work Commission. We delivered a 15 per cent increase to award-wage minimums for 250,000 workers. That's an $11.3 billion investment in the people who dedicate their working lives to caring for older Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the Albanese government, registered nurses are now taking home an additional $196 a week, or $10,000 a year. Personal care workers are now earning an additional $141 a week, or an extra $7,300 a year. That bump in their weekly pay packet is changing the lives of workers, which in turn changes the lives of the people they care for. Paula, a registered nurse in aged care, told me this weekend: 'Thank you for not only improving our wages but also for improving the quality of care and the time that we get to spend with our elderly. They appreciate that too.' </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And Paula is right. Our investment in aged-care workers is paying dividends for the people they care for. Under the Albanese government, older people are receiving an additional 2.16 million minutes of care per day. There has been a reduction in the number of pressure injuries, a reduction in the number of physical restraints, a reduction in significant unplanned weight loss, a reduction in falls, a reduction in polypharmacy and a reduction in the use of antipsychotics in aged care. We are also seeing improvements in the star ratings data, with fewer one- and two-star rated facilities and more four- and five-star rated facilities. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But we do not just want workers to earn more; we want them to keep more of what they earn. From 1 July, every single taxpayer, including aged-care workers, will receive a tax cut. So not only can a registered nurse like Paula take $10,000 more; under the Albanese government she will now get a tax cut of $1,679 from 1 July under Labor's tax cuts. That is almost double what Paula would have gotten from the coalition. </span>

                  </a>  The member for Warringah is of course entitled to raise a point of order, and we have had this issue raised in the previous couple of weeks of parliament. The particular difficulty I have is that in the examples and what <span style="font-style:italic;">P</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ractice </span>has shown over decades, the type of question that has been asked by the member has been asked for a very long time. There are numerous examples of where the argument raised in the question has been put to various ministers over the time. The minister has the opportunity now to disagree or agree with the premise of the question or what's in the question. And if we were to start applying this directly then indeed everyone's questions would be in focus, which, if that's the will of the chamber, we can look at. But I think even questions from the crossbench would fall under that. On the point of order—</span>

                  </a>  Respectfully, though, Mr Speaker, this does go to a question of principle of the standing orders. There is a purposeful mischaracterisation of a government policy that is in breach of these standing orders. It means either that the standing orders are pointless or that they are being belligerently ignored on the assumption that the standing orders won't be applied.</span>

And in line with <span style="font-style:italic;">P</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ractice </span>and what has happened for some decades now of how questions have been asked—and I'm happy to send her examples of that over the time—it would assist everyone if everyone could refresh every question and ensure that standing order 100 doesn't include arguments, inferences, imputations, insults, ironical expression or hypothetical matter. So, whilst I'll note what the member has said, this question is in order. The member is entitled to ask, just as everyone is entitled to ask, their question, and the minister will now be entitled to respond to the question. The minister has the call.</span>

The question goes to bringing Australia in line with the policies in other countries, and that is a fair point for the honourable member to make, because it is the fact that Australia and Russia are the only two major economies without vehicle efficiency standards in place. The United States has had them in place since the mid-1970s—introduced, to be fair, by a conservative administration; President Gerald R Ford introduced vehicle efficiency standards in the United States at the time. It is the case that we had considerable catching up to do with the rest of the world, because the rest of the world has been introducing these standards and because Australia has been so late to the party when it comes to introducing the standards. Several governments have tried, but until now no government has followed through and delivered for Australian motorists.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've been reflecting over the parliamentary break, and I think I've been unfair to the member for Bradfield. I have pointed out his strong support for vehicle efficiency standards, but I think an observer could reach the conclusion that he was the only one on the other side. To his credit, he is a strong supporter of vehicle efficiency standards, but he wasn't the only one. Indeed, he of course had joint carriage with the then member for Kooyong and the then member for Flinders, Mr Hunt. He took it through cabinet on several occasions, to his credit. Everyone who was in cabinet at that time in 2016 and 2017 obviously signed it off. The Leader of the Opposition would have been in favour of it. There was a joint media statement—a big gold crest on the media statement—from all three ministers. It said in relation to the honourable member's question about international standards—</span>

                  </a>  The minister will pause. The minister was asked a question about why he's pursuing this policy. He is giving context as to why he's pursuing the policy. Just like the member for Griffith, I gave the same advice to the member for Fairfax. He's entitled to raise a point of order.</span>

                  </a>  The question went to the minister's comparison to the United States and the scheme he is introducing. The point of order is one of relevance. The question went to the United States having an annual reduction of 1.4. He's requiring Australia reduce it by 12 per cent on an annual rate. Can—</span>

                  </a>  Resume your seat. The minister needs to make sure his answer is relevant. The question contained detailed analysis by the member for Fairfax, and it finished with the question about why the minister is pursuing the question. I'm going to give him the call to make sure he's being relevant to that part of the question. He can deal with the others as he sees fit.</span>

                  </a>  Certainly, Mr Speaker, and I appreciate the guidance. Australia does have a lot of catching up to do with the United States, who introduced these standards in the mid-1970s; we are seeking to catch up with them, yes, and that means we are ambitious. We are ambitious not for ourselves but for the Australian people to catch up with the United States.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Although Australia accounts for less than two per cent of the global new vehicle market, it is becoming increasingly important that we harmonise our approaches to vehicle emissions with those in place in other countries.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is what we are seeking to do. We're not seeking to catch up with New Zealand or Europe, which have more ambitious standards. We are seeking to catch up with the United States.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is the case that they did it in the 1970s. We are trying to implement them in 2024, which comes considerably too late when you consider that John Howard went to the 2001 election promising, 'The coalition is negotiating new fuel efficiency standards for motor vehicles to reduce the amount of fuel consumed per kilometre travelled.' The Liberals kept talking about it. We will deliver it.</span>

It will create 3,000 real jobs in remote communities with proper wages and proper conditions. It will build the remote workforce and boost regional economies.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the Kalano Community Association just outside Katherine I saw for myself innovation in action. I met two young men who had joined the remote jobs trial that makes swags—a Territory essential, apparently. The long-term plan is to develop a local swag-making business. It is an idea that's come from the community and is being led by the community. I also spoke to women from nearby Rockhole who are working in Deadly Cooking, making healthy, nutritious meals using an electric fry pan—a very sensible idea in remote Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At Binjari I joined the Prime Minister to announce a historic investment to improve housing in remote Northern Territory. The joint funding with the Northern Territory government will see up to 270 new homes built each year for 10 years. Importantly, it will also fund repairs and maintenance. Reducing overcrowding means better health, keeping children and families safe and allowing children to focus properly on school. In Binjari, we met Stevie, Stuart and Stephanie, who had just moved into their new home, which has good design, environmental sustainability and disability access. They are so happy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Decent housing and more opportunities to work are fundamental to closing the gap. They bring pride and they also bring local employment. As Skye Thompson, the CEO of Aboriginal Housing Northern Territory, said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… it is an investment in people … This investment will help ensure Aboriginal Australians across the Northern Territory are able to live with dignity and pride, where their kids can grow safe, healthy and strong and truly look to their futures with real hope and optimism.</span>

Because of 10 years of denial, delay and inaction, Australians don't. Those opposite know we should. The member for Bradfield knows it. He was a very fervent advocate for them, and he pointed out on multiple occasions that in no country in the world has there been an upward impact on any particular model.

Yes, the stacking of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal under the former government was a sight to behold. As many as 85 former Liberal MPs, failed Liberal candidates, former Liberal staffers and other close associates of the Liberal Party were piled into plum jobs with the AAT, without any merit based selection process, on salaries worth hundreds of thousands of dollars. They did it again and again, including on the eve of the last election.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Decisions of the AAT have life-changing impacts for thousands of Australians. From people with a disability seeking support through the NDIS to vulnerable families trying to get the right social security payments, Australians count on the AAT to get a fair hearing. But the Liberal Party didn't care. The stacking of the AAT by the Liberal Party was shameless. It just went higher and higher, like the world's most perilous game of Jenga, stack after stack, and it resulted in a tribunal that was entirely dysfunctional. And I hope you heard the earlier part of my answer! Backlogs out of control, people waiting months or even years for review of a basic AAT decision—just like a game of Jenga, it all came tumbling down. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, the Albanese government does care about Australians who are struggling. We do care about their right to a fair and independent process and to have a system they can trust. We wasted no time, on coming into office, in starting to fix the mess that those opposite left. The legislation that I introduced in December last year, developed in consultation with people who use the system every day, would abolish the AAT and replace it with a new administrative review body that is user focused, efficient, accessible, independent and fair. The legislation requires that members of the tribunal be appointed through a competitive, publicly advertised, merit based process. Our commitment to this is already on display, with more than 100 new appointments made already through our merit based process. </span>

As she probably observed keenly when we released it last week, the release of the Aged Care Taskforce report is an important next step, but it is a step in our journey on aged-care reform in this country. The Aged Care Taskforce, which we set up mid last year, worked for six months and did a huge amount of consultation, including with people from her electorate. There were 11 roundtables held by taskforce members themselves and an additional 12 roundtables that were held by both OPAN, the Older Persons Advocacy Network, and COTA, the Council on the Ageing, on the terms of reference of the taskforce, with their members specifically, so that the people they had on the taskforce could feed that back in for discussion. Additionally, there were 180 submissions made. There were numerous webinars. We have six months worth of consultation where those questions and contributions were made and were considered by the taskforce. You would have seen last Tuesday the 23 recommendations that the taskforce made to government. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The report of the taskforce does not represent the government's response. The government are now considering our response to those 23 recommendations. What we have done so far across the couple of months that we have had that report is advance our work to the point that last week we could give older Australians some certainty about the pathway we would take forward. What we were able to say was that we would rule out any new levy across Australians, any new tax on Australians and any changes to the arrangements for the family home, which I hope gives some of the constituents that you're speaking with about this some confidence and certainty about what this pathway looks moving forward. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we will do to move forward is continue to work through this within the processes that we have in government. In order to do that, we have commenced meeting with the opposition to see whether there is a pathway for us to do this in a bipartisan manner. You will have seen in the opposition leader's budget reply in October last year that this is something that parties and crossbenchers from all parts of this parliament consider to be something that should be above politics. Better aged care in this country should be above politics.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The early responses that I saw from people last week is that there may be pathway forward for us to do this in a bipartisan manner. I think your constituents would find that to be both reassuring and something they would expect us to be able to do in this parliament. We have offered some briefings so far to members of different parties and crossbenchers in this place. We will continue to do that as we move this work forward, and I will update the House on progress as soon as I'm able to do so.</span>

There are about 400,000 of our fellow Australians who work in disability care. They're very hardworking, and as we meet here they're looking after some of the most vulnerable people in our community, ensuring they have good quality of life and that they're getting the support they need. Most—if not just about all—disability workers earn less than $150,000 a year. Whilst they deserve the thanks of the people here in this House, they also deserve some good news.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact of the matter is that under the Labor government, on 1 July this hardworking cohort of Australians are going to get good news. Thank goodness Labor changed the tax policy to make sure that disability workers and many other workers under $150,000 are going to get fair dinkum tax cuts! A disability support worker on about $75,000 a year is going to get $1,500 more back in their tax next year. An occupational therapist on $110,000 will get north of $2,000 extra because of Labor's tax cuts. When you look at how disability workers are faring under Labor, it's a successful trifecta. There are the tax cuts on 1 July, wages under Labor have moved 11.2 per cent for disability carers and, as an added bonus, the superannuation is going up. Disability workers are getting overdue recognition only under a Labor government for the hard work they do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Adelaide also asked what creates a more sustainable NDIS. Disability care workers deserve a more sustainable NDIS so they can have good careers in the future. One of the big challenges to a more sustainable NDIS is fraud. The Albanese Labor government has been taking real action to clamp down on fraud in the NDIS. Over the last year the crime taskforce that Labor established in late 2022 has been looking at the operation of plan managers in the NDIS. Unfortunately, whilst there are 1,500 plan managers, too many do not have the best interests of participants at heart. Some are very good—there's no question. But plan managers handle $22 billion of payment and they charge half a billion dollars for it. The problem is that once the NDIA and the taskforce forwarded to the tax office the records of the at-risk cohort of about 900 plan managers, 343 came back from the taskforce with problems. There were no records, they're not paying and they're not declaring their income. The Labor government is determined to make sure that we can keep this scheme sustainable.</span>

After four months, the minister has not responded. Mr Speaker, can I ask that you write to the minister and seek her explanation as to why she has chosen not to answer my question in writing within 60 days.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="DZY" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GEORGANAS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Adelaide</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:01</span>):  I will continue where I left off just before we had our 90-second statements. I was talking about the certainty that we require in superannuation. What this bill does is ensure that there is an agreed objective for superannuation, so different administrations, different governments and regulators that come in keep that scope in mind every time there is a change to superannuation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said earlier, many people depend on superannuation for their retirement. Many people rely on their super, after years and years of hard work, to have some income after they retire. The significance of this bill extends right across Australia to all workers. But the bill does many other things as well. It ensures that we keep a tab on superannuation in terms of the direction it's going and whether it's fulfilling its purpose. We want to ensure that there are no adverse results and consequences for the savings of numerous Australians—millions of Australians, when you think about it—across the nation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The objective outlined in the bill seeks to militate against such occurrences—occurrences that diminish super in terms of different legislation that may be brought into this place. We want to ensure that the superannuation system fulfils its commitment of delivering a secure retirement for every Australian. Any forthcoming modifications or propositions concerning superannuation legislation must be scrutinised against this objective—again, that is focusing on what we want as an outcome for superannuation—as it should be. This scrutiny will ensure accountability among policymakers in their deliberations on matters impacting the retirement savings of the millions of Australians who contribute towards super.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This objective does not supersede any existing obligations that are incumbent upon superannuation trustees. That doesn't change one little bit. Nor does it alter the provisions allowing early access to super on compassionate grounds. Many people come into our offices—I suspect I'm not the only one—who are in dire straits and need some form of assistance through their super. But those are rare occasions, and it's always on compassionate grounds in terms of being in a completely dire state with your finances. This bill will solidify the overarching principles guiding our superannuation system. It will have a clearly defined objective which will facilitate the maximisation of these broader benefits for the collective interests of the members. Labor's foundational efforts have resulted in our current $3.5 trillion superannuation system, positioning it as the fourth largest globally, the fourth largest in the world. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The commitment of this Albanese Labor government remains unwavering in safeguarding and strengthening the system, as Labor governments have always done from the inception of superannuation in the mid-nineties right through to today. That is a core foundation of the Labor Party. Its purpose was to build retirement funds for people who were retiring, and that will remain its purpose under this government. We need to ensure a secure retirement for more Australians while reinforcing our nation's economic resilience. The Superannuation (Objective) Bill 2023 represents that crucial step towards constructing a transparent and resilient superannuation system, one that serves the best interests of all Australians within the confines of the law, keeping that focus on what the purpose of superannuation is and ensuring that we do everything we can to enhance superannuation. It was at the core of the Labor Party in the mid-nineties to ensure that people could retire with some dignity and with some funds that could perhaps supplement, and in many cases completely take over from, the old age pension.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a very important piece of legislation, and we have proven on this side that we're always strengthening superannuation laws. We know the purpose of superannuation and what its goals are. On the other side, the opposition, while they were in government, have continuously tried to diminish superannuation and use it for a whole range of other purposes. The sole purpose of superannuation is to have funds for your retirement when you are not working and you are not earning an income, and to have those funds there to enable you to live the rest of your life in some form of dignity and not wanting handouts. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, that is not the case for everyone. Some people will be supplementing superannuation with the old age pension. Others may not, depending on how much they have put aside over the years while they have been working, but it is a great system. It is one of the best systems in the world. And I know—I've been following it since the nineties—where we are with superannuation. We're now seeing more and more people relying on the funds that they have, more so than the age pension, and that can only be a good thing, because when you retire the bills do not stop coming in. You still need to put food on the table, you still need to pay bills, you still need to put petrol in the car, and you still need to have a form of income; this is what super does. I commend the bill. I support it, and I hope the other side will be supporting it as well. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kooyong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:07</span>):  The objective of superannuation should be to provide an adequate income to ensure that all Australians achieve a comfortable standard of living in retirement, supplementing or substituting the age pension. Preservation, retirement income, equity, sustainability and a dignified retirement should be at the heart of our superannuation policy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In this country, housing plays a major role in determining retirement outcomes. Retirees who own a home generally have a better standard of living than those who rent. Those renting in retirement often face financial stress. They face high rates of income poverty. Homeownership rates have declined, especially among younger and lower- to middle-income Australians, in the last four decades. The value of housing has shot up since the 1990s. House prices have increased by as much as 30 per cent in some parts of the country in the last 12 months alone. This obviously benefits existing homeowners, but it does not help those who are renting and those who are hoping to buy. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians can generally access their super prior to retirement in limited circumstances—for medical treatment, for home modifications, for disability and in emergency situations to prevent foreclosure. The opposition is keen on extending those provisions to allow Australians early access to superannuation for housing. They have recently suggested that doing so might help address housing affordability and that it might help first home buyers enter the property market. It takes but an instant to see two massive holes in this proposition: firstly, the potential impact on retirement savings; and, secondly, the fact that this change would result in reduced affordability in an already overheated property market. Clearly, raiding your super early will have a significant compounding effect on retirement savings. For example, the Super Members Council found that a couple of 30-year-olds who each withdrew $35,000 from their super will retire with about $195,000 less in today's dollars.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But we don't have to imagine an imaginary scenario. Fortunately—or, rather, unfortunately for those involved—the great minds of the opposition have already provided us with a model for the potential outcome of what happens when you allow Australians early access to their super. In the early stages of the COVID pandemic, before the JobKeeper scheme kicked in, the Morrison-Frydenberg government encouraged Australians to sacrifice their retirement savings to support themselves. Through the COVID early release scheme, 4.9 million Australians applied to access their super, taking up to $20,000 from their super during the period between April and December 2020. Half of them were aged less than 35; almost 40 per cent of Australians between 25 and 35 accessed their super at that time. Tragically, 725,000 Australians effectively wiped out their superannuation accounts in early- to mid-2020.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Compound earnings make up three-quarters of our super balance at retirement. So those who lost that super in 2020 will never recoup those losses. It's estimated that $38 billion of early withdrawals at that time will cost those super fund members $85 billion in their retirement savings. A 30-year-old who took out $20,000 then will be more than $93,000 worse off at retirement. In my electorate of Kooyong, more than 21,000 people elected to access their super in 2020; 5,396 Kooyong residents wiped out their super entirely. We mortgaged the future of a generation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're all going to pay for that early release scheme, not just those people who needed help at a critical time and had nowhere else to go. The early release of super scheme will mean a higher reliance on the age pension as well as a lower tax income from superannuation. It will cost this country $2.5 billion a year from the mid-2060s. Industry Super Australia has modelled that, for every $1 taken out, the taxpayer will pay up to $2.50 extra in age pension costs. Those early pandemic withdrawals gave young Australians a lifelong form of financial long COVID.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The cost will be borne by future taxpayers either explicitly via increasing their taxes or implicitly via a reduction in the government provided services that they receive: education, aged care, NDIS, child care or health. Over the course of their lifetime, a person now aged 20 who did not access their super in 2020 will still be expected to pay at least $3,000 extra in income tax just to compensate society for the former member for Kooyong's COVID early release scheme. These are the devastating consequences of schemes that break the preservation rules of super. People are left with far less money at retirement, and the next generation, our children and our grandchildren, will have to pay higher taxes to pick up the bill for higher pension costs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And what of the potential effect on housing affordability? This country already has a housing shortage. Building approvals are at a decade low, having surged during the pandemic. Allowing Australians to access their super will increase competition for existing stock. It will drive up housing prices. It makes no sense to increase demand when supply is so limited. The Super Members Council has published modelling suggesting that median house prices in major capital cities could jump by nine per cent or as much as $70,000 in cities like Melbourne.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another question is whether young people have enough in their super to afford a home deposit. Under the opposition's proposed scheme to withdraw $50,000, a person would need superannuation savings of $125,000. This is a sum the average Australian does not accrue until they are in their 40s. So who is this policy meant to help? Most people who are genuinely struggling to buy a home have so little super that allowing them to raid it would effectively make very little difference. But, paradoxically, allowing people to use their super for housing would increase the purchasing power of those who already have a higher income and, hence, a higher super balance. This is the group who are already most able to buy. Giving them access to faster capital will push up prices across the board. It'll make it harder for those people struggling to get a foothold in the market.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Liberal-aligned think tank Blueprint Institute has estimated that the demand for low-cost housing would outstrip supply four to one under the opposition's proposal. The Centre for Independent Studies, another right-wing think tank, has said allowing first home buyers to use their superannuation as collateral or as a home deposit would increase access to housing for favoured recipients but decrease it for everybody else. The RBA and APRA have also cautioned against using super for housing, saying that we, in doing so, will inflate property prices. Saul Eslake, a member of the government's National Housing Supply Council, has pointed out any policy measures which would enable people to pay more for housing than they otherwise would results not in people owning homes but rather in existing homes becoming more expensive.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But why stop there with those opinions? Let's look at what the opposition has said in the past about allowing people to withdraw from their retirement savings to help them buy a home. In October 2014 the then finance minister, Mathias Cormann, said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Increasing the amount of money going into real estate by facilitating access to super savings pre-retirement will not improve housing affordability. It would increase demand for housing and, all other things being equal, would actually drive up house prices by more. That is, it would reduce housing affordability, including for first home buyers. The only effective way to tackle housing affordability is by boosting housing supply, not by boosting demand.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Thanks, Mathias! Let's see who else has talked about this from the right side. Malcolm Turnbull said it was 'a thoroughly bad idea' and, 'This is not what the superannuation system is designed to achieve.' That was in March 2015. In April 2017, when he was prime minister, Mr Turnbull again rejected the idea, at which time the now opposition leader, the member for Dickson, commented: 'I think Malcolm has it right. He's referred back to his previous words on this to say that it's not a good policy, and I agree with him.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the member for Farrer, said in April 2017:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Young people need their super for retirement, not to try to take pressure off an urban housing bubble, better solved by decentralisation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The House of Representatives Standing Committee on Tax and Revenue, then chaired by the former member for Mackellar, noted in May 2022:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… the Committee recognises that allowing first home buyers to access or borrow against part of their super to purchase a home would, in the absence of increased housing supply, likely increase demand and lead to higher property prices.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Faced with this genius proposal, in May 2022 Senator Jane Hume said, 'I would imagine in the short term you might see a bump in house prices.' And former prime minister John Howard, the relic they love to roll out at every occasion, said, 'Super is for retirement.'</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is appropriate that we reevaluate how much super Australians are accruing and what they do with it. In my electorate of Kooyong, the political landscape is dominated by cost-of-living concerns. Rent and housing attainability are two of the three highest priorities of my constituents but especially my younger constituents. I've talked to them. They believe in super and the rationale for it. They know it's their money—after they turn 65. They believe that Australians should not have to choose between a house and a nest egg. Their current sense of insecurity heightens their feelings regarding the importance of having security in the future. Some of the young people of Kooyong accessed their superannuation during COVID, but now they feel they have been duped. They are aware of the fact that the COVID early release scheme and others like it can entrench intergenerational inequity. Their response to the opposition's proposal is that this is not the purpose of superannuation. Allowing people to access their super would just put more money into the housing market. In the absence of additional supply, the equation is simple: it would drive up house prices. Those accessing their super would pay more for less. The only people advantaged would be those who own their homes already.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One might think that the opposition is playing to its base: older voters who are already in the housing market. The issue is this: older voters in electorates like mine are smarter than that. They see through this ploy. They want their own children to be able to afford a home in their own lifetime, and they don't want their children to have to rob their future in order to do so. Younger voters in electorates like mine are also smarter than the opposition. They understand the purpose of superannuation. They argue that Australians shouldn't have to choose between a home and a nest egg. They don't trust future governments or their ability to provide adequate pensions in the face of an ageing population and a narrowing tax base. They know that the current housing crisis is the result of successive governments' policy failures.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We all want Australians to have access to secure and affordable housing. It's a right, not a privilege. And we want Australians to have security and comfort in their retirement. With an ageing population and in the face of increasing intergenerational inequity we will not achieve those things by asking our young adults to rob their futures to pay for their present. Governments are responsible for the housing crisis. Governments should fix it. As John Howard said, 'Super is for retirement.'</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fraser</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:21</span>):  Poverty, vulnerability and uncertainty have been hallmarks of old age for many people throughout human history, and societies have grappled with how to help people navigate these challenges. For much of human history the main mechanism by which older people dealt with these risks was through the family. That worked some of the time, but it was patchy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the 19th century, in a number of countries, academics, public policymakers and government officials started to explore whether there were ways in which something better, more stable and more comprehensive could be constructed. One example: in the 1890s, Charles Booth undertook a major survey of poverty of elderly people in Victorian England. At around the same time, in 1899, a departmental committee on the aged deserving poor also undertook a rigorous statistical analysis of those living in poverty and those living with insecurity in Victorian England. They found that a very significant number of older people relied on charity, on their local parish or on the whims of relatives, or some combination of these.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In some parts of England at the time, 23 per cent, or just a quarter of people, relied solely on earnings. Many people relied on other forms of assistance. While that reflected families and communities coming together, as I mentioned earlier, it put many people in a situation where they were vulnerable and where they were insecure, and that led to a number of countries exploring whether it was appropriate for the government to create a safety net.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We saw safety nets created in Germany in the 1890s and in parts of Scandinavia at around the same time, Bismarck's Germany being the one with the highest profile—a basic pension to support those above a certain age. These were important schemes. They were very fiscally modest but they were an important step forward. They provided a much greater level of certainty for people who may not have had family or people who perhaps had suffered other shocks in their lives, like bad health outcomes. Many other countries followed suit. Australia wasn't the very first, but it was one of the first movers. In Australia, legislation was passed in 1908 to provide for an age pension. This was one of the key planks of our social welfare state, and I believe it remains to this day one of the key antipoverty measures, one of the key civilising institutions in our society.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If one goes back to that time in 1909 and looks at that scheme, it's telling. People on the age pension in 1909 received 10 shillings. There were just 34,000 people on the age pension. Each of those received something in the order of 12 per cent of average male earnings. I think what's particularly telling is that the retirement age at the time for men was 65 but life expectancy was 55. So people were getting this benefit but the average life expectancy was materially below the age at which it kicked in. That's obviously totally different to the situation we find today. Women's retirement age was 60 but their life expectancy was 59—a smaller gap, but, nonetheless, life expectancy was below the official retirement age. What we saw was that, as in other countries in Western Europe and the US a couple of decades later, the age pension was introduced but didn't cost a great deal, partly because the replacement rate wasn't particularly high but also because people weren't living that long.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we've seen since then is that life expectancy has increased fairly continuously over the last 100 years—a wonderful thing for people; a reflection of healthier lifestyles, more effective health services and other things. We're also having fewer kids. So what we find is that, over the last century, we have a retirement income system, an age pension, that is costing more and more relative to our taxpayer base. We saw superannuation gradually being introduced in the post-war era to supplement the age pension. In Australia, this was a critical means by which we as a country, firstly, took pressure off the age pension and, secondly, provided assistance to people to save for themselves and provide themselves with more autonomy and more agency.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If we go back to 1991 and the introduction of some of the absolutely key pieces of legislation that, to this day, continue to underpin our superannuation system, Paul Keating said, 'I wish to propose the creation of a comprehensive national retirement income system.' At that time, he was making it clear that superannuation was to complement, to add to, the age pension. He talked about the fact that the superannuation legislation that he was bringing in in 1991 would involve not just broader coverage but also a move over time to a 12 per cent contribution rate, for greater adequacy in terms of people saving for themselves, given longer life expectancy. When Keating spoke to students at the Australian Graduate School of Management on 25 July 1991, he said:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Way back in 1991 he saw the demographic pressures that our age pension scheme would come under. That was one of the key motivations for those seminal and important pieces of legislation back in 1991.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If we look at some of the statements from the Treasurer at the time, in 1992 John Dawkins made the observation when introducing key legislation that, in 1983, 40 per cent of the workforce had some super cover—although, even there, it was patchy in terms of how much it provided. By 1991 that proportion had risen to 72 per cent, and it's far higher today thanks to the legislation that they both championed at the time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it's critical to go back to that period, to 1991, because today's bill is a very important piece of reform that is helping to solidify that second key step. If the age pension back in 1909 was the first step to help our society better deal with vulnerability, uncertainty and poverty in old age by providing a basic safety net for everybody, and if superannuation as broadened and deepened in 1991 was the second complimentary key step, it's critical to think deeply about what it is that the system is there to achieve.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In his second reading speech for the Superannuation Guarantee (Administration) Bill 1992, John Dawkins spoke in relation to expanding coverage. He said, 'There is also a need to increase the average level of superannuation savings for each individual if these savings are to provide for an adequate level of retirement income.' So it's adequacy of income in retirement, saving at a sufficient rate to reflect the fact that people are living longer and some people are retiring earlier.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">John Dawkins, in that same speech, said, 'It will lay the foundation for income security and higher standards of living in retirement for future generations of retirees.' Higher standards of living in retirement: that's what we are aiming for. In the face of demographic pressures, we're trying to move away from a system where all too many retirees live in poverty, live with insecurity, live worried about whether their savings will last them through their lives, live worried that they will be at the whim of others for their income, live worried about what a negative shock such as a bad health outcome will do to them. This will provide both income security and high standards of living. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, Keating, from that same year in parliament, said that for him a decent standard of living in retirement lay at the heart the superannuation system. In his words: 'It is the difference between a full, active life and a life governed by budgetary exigencies the vagueness of politics.' Superannuation was to provide people with a decent, adequate, secure standard of living in retirement. Again in Keating's words: 'The difference of being able to enjoy the free time at the end of one's working life and wanting the means to enjoy it.' </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As opposed to 1909, when some people lived beyond 65 and enjoyed years in retirement—but not that many—now we have a situation, fortunately, where the vast majority live past 65, and many for decades past it. That's why superannuation is absolutely critical if we are going to provide that dignity. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's important to go back to that period, to 1991 and 1992, with the architects of the scheme to look at the core purpose they saw this scheme providing and, I believe, the purpose that it has actually lived to provide in its maturity. This bill embeds that purpose into the superannuation system. The purpose in this bill that we are discussing today is to preserve savings to deliver income for a dignified retirement, alongside government support, in an equitable and sustainable way. Those words go right back into 1991. They could have come out of the second reading speeches of Treasurer Dawkins or PM Keating. They could have come out of the commentary at that time. That is why today's bill is so important: because a dignified retirement, security, and sustainable and equitable supports for people remain absolutely at the heart. This is a simple but cogent and coherent purpose that is contained in this bill. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill also does not just define it; it says that future changes to the superannuation system must support that objective rather than undermining it. That means that half-baked or populist measures that will undermine the system—such as measures that undermine the potential for people to keep money in their accounts over long periods of time and schemes that attack preservation—will need to come into this place, and the onus will be on people proposing such schemes to justify how they support the system, how they support the purpose of superannuation rather than undermining it. In my opinion, they will have a very hard time doing so. Clearly defining the objective will make it that much harder for people to bring forward schemes that have a very short-term objective, a very political objective, but that undermine the scheme. It is absolutely critical for our retirees that that protection is there. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will finish on the point that, again, those architects back in 1991 had it so right. They talked about the fact that you need a public safety net. You need voluntary savings and then you need mandatory savings, which is what the superannuation scheme is. It's those three key pillars. When you go back to the mid-1990s, the World Bank, in its seminal report, <span style="font-style:italic;">A</span><span style="font-style:italic;">verting the old-age crisis</span>, was built around those three pillars. So it almost could have been structured around the second reading speeches I just read from. It's this ability to provide risk-management at the individual level, by having a safety net and by providing people with management against longevity risk, with protection against inflation risk and with protection against other shocks in their lives, like health outcomes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The age pension is still very good at providing individuals with that risk protection, but the mandatory superannuation system is very good at providing people with protection against an aging society. It's intergenerational, in the sense that it's helping individuals to save for themselves at a future time when there will be fewer taxpayers to provide for them. And it's the fact that we have a retirement income system with all of these pillars working together. Today's bill is critical for that, because the purpose of that third pillar—the superannuation system; the mandated savings—which is to provide adequacy and sustainability and equity in people's retirement income, is absolutely critical.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll just go back to the words that were spoken in that debate, back when these key bills were introduced: that when the superannuation system works well, when people are not forced to take away from today to support themselves today at the expense of tomorrow, when preservation is protected and when people are contributing at a suitable rate then, in the words of those wise people back in 1991, our superannuation can help to provide 'the difference between being able to enjoy the free time at the end of one's working life and wanting the means to enjoy it.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our superannuation scheme has fulfilled so much of the promise that it held back in 1991, and today we're strengthening its ability to continue to do so in the future.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="247742" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HOWARTH</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Petrie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:36</span>):  I'm really happy to rise today to speak about superannuation. It's a subject that's dear to my heart, as someone who started my own super fund when I was 19. The Superannuation (Objective) Bill is pretty straightforward—'a bill for an act relating to the objective of superannuation'. Most people would already know what super is for. This bill I think really explains what is already in place. The reality is that super is there for people when they retire.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But not everyone knows a lot about what actually happens with their super. Some of the things that the former coalition government did have really made Australians aware of the options that they have around super. The former coalition government delivered real reforms to superannuation that actually delivered for Australians. On this side of the House, we understand that superannuation is Australians' money. It's not the government's money, it's not the Prime Minister's or the Treasurer's money, it's not the unions' money, it's not the member for Kooyong's money; it's actually Australians' money. It's their money. And with $3½ trillion in super funds at the moment, the government has a tremendous responsibility to every Australian who has invested in superannuation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I sometimes think that those opposite, the current Labor government, don't seem to understand that super is Australians' money. They might think that it's their money—that it's an opportunity to have those funds for them to use—and I'll come back to that a bit more later.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The basic principle of superannuation is pretty simple, and I think it's important that we outline it here. Quite simply, superannuation is about providing for people—for Australians—in their retirement. We've heard some conflict there from the Treasurer, who has mentioned that superannuation should be used for nation-building projects—often associated with industry super funds that are linked to unions—or to invest in social housing through industry super funds. Well, I'll say it again: the basic principle is that superannuation doesn't belong to the government or even the industry super fund or the retail fund that's managing it. It's up to Australians how they invest their money.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When I was 19, I had the fortunate opportunity where my dad said to me: 'Luke, put away $80 a month. Salary sacrifice $80 a month into super.' At the time, I think I was earning about $290 a week or something, working in retail, and I didn't really want to give up 80 bucks a month. That would have filled up my car well and truly back then. But, over time, that just built. I understood and learnt a little bit about salary sacrificing and watched that grow over time. The company that I invested in was bought out by someone else, and then I ended up with some shares. As a former assistant minister for youth, I also learnt that a lot of our younger Australians, particularly those aged between 15 and 24, don't always have the financial literacy that I was fortunate enough to have been taught. So, rather than the $400 million, or whatever it is, being spent by the government on advertising tax cuts—which they wouldn't be doing if the former coalition government hadn't legislated stage 3 tax cuts to start with—that money could be better spent on financial literacy programs like the First Home Super Saver Scheme, which explained salary sacrificing and how people can get into a home that way as well. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've also seen that the government have broken promises in relation to super. We know that during a cost-of-living crisis it's even more important that we ensure our superannuation schemes remain focused on those people they're meant to bring security to—the Australian people. We had the Prime Minister promise before the last election that life would be easier under him, that the cost of living would be reduced under him, that there would be no changes to superannuation under him, and now we have seen that the government has broken a number of promises, time and time again, in less than two years. At the 2022 election, the Labor government claimed that they wanted to end the superannuation wars. That's what they said. The Prime Minister and the Treasurer promised no changes to superannuation prior to the election. Then, in February 2023, after he was elected, the Prime Minister promised no 'major' changes. So there was one thing before the election and one thing after. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that the government have introduced a new superannuation tax on unrealised capital gains. That will affect the youth of today, because, while it's on balances over $3 million and kicks in from 1 July 2025, it's not indexed. If it's not indexed, people that are 19 today, like one of my sons, will, in 40 years from now, be hit with a tax that's double the rate it is today in March 2024. It's currently taxed at 15 per cent, and they have legislated to take it up to 30 per cent. So they have broken the trust of the Australian people. The government have continually come into this place and justified it by saying, 'It's only wealthy people,' or, 'It's only people that turn over a certain amount.' They continually pit Australians against each other. They did the same thing with the stage 3 tax cuts, with a promise not to change them, and then they did that as well. There were many policies that weren't taken to the election or that they said they wouldn't change and have now changed, and it's not good enough. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The former coalition government understood that the primary purpose of super funds is to make investment decisions that are in the best interests of members, and this was critical to our Your Super, Your Future reform package. Once again, the government have indicated that they're looking to make changes there as well—that they want to make changes to benefit the people that donate to them. That's what the Labor Party often does around legislation when they come into this place. They legislate for union donors. We saw that through one of the first moves this government made, which was to repeal the arrangement that we set in place around Your Future, Your Super, namely:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… Clearly, expenditure on items that are not supported by identifiable financial benefits to members articulated in a clear business case, are unlikely to satisfy the requirements of the best financial interests duty.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This move alone has allowed unaccountable expenditure to run rife since the election of this government, in less than two years. In the last financial year, 2022-23, 10 super funds made over $15 million in payments to unions and over $21 million to the now-defunct Industry Super Australia. The premise of this legislation is important to ensuring that the objective of super remains within the best interests of Australians, and the government can't be trusted when it comes to this. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I mentioned before the First Home Super Saver Scheme, which the members here in the chamber at the moment all voted against. It was a pretty simple policy that actually did more to help young Australians and educate them on financial literacy than anything that this government has ever done, because it taught thousands of Australians about the importance of salary sacrificing where they're earning a wage. They might be on $80,000 a year. At the time they were getting about 10 per cent—another $8,000 a year—in super . What we legislated was that they could salary-sacrifice more funds into their super and then withdraw them for their first house. All these youths throughout Australia—and not just youths under 25 but some people in their 30s as well—had started to salary-sacrifice into their super.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those who are now in government fought against it all the way and said they'd repeal it. I congratulate them on not doing that, because, once again, it's helped tens of thousands of people into their own homes and taught them about salary sacrifice. Rather than paying 30 per cent tax on their wage and ending up with a $10,000 contribution—a $7,000 deposit, because they lost $3,000 in tax—they put it into their super and are taxed on it at 15 per cent, so on that $10,000 their tax is $1,500, and they end up with $8,500 as a deposit, as opposed to $7,000. That Australian is $1,500 better off, with a higher deposit for their home. That's happening right now. It's legislated law of the land today. The coalition put that in place, along with a number of other policies to help Australians into their first home. So it won't surprise Australians if we take to the next election—which we will—the opportunity for Australians to use a little bit of the super that they currently have in place to help them into their first home. We're not making apologies for it, and this bill does nothing to stop it. We will take that to the next election. I can say to my coalition colleagues in this place that we should continue to take it to elections and explain it. If we think it's the right thing to do then we should continue to take it to elections.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's the same with energy or anything else. The Treasurer often speaks about using superannuation and industry funds to invest in clean energy, but they won't invest in, or even talk about, nuclear power. In fact, he rubbished it today. We know that, if they're serious about climate change and want to meet net-zero emissions, it's probably the only baseload power they can do. So what we get is hypocrisy from this government, because on the one hand they say, 'Oh, you can't do this with your super,' but, when it comes to industry funds, that's okay. It's alright if their union donors who manage these industry funds do it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's absolutely wrong, and in the lead-up to the next election I and others around the place will be out there talking to young Australians about their super and encouraging them to salary-sacrifice. I believe in super. I want people to salary-sacrifice. I want them to contribute over and above what their employer contribution is. But, if they want to use part of their super to help get them into a home in the middle of a rental crisis, they should be allowed to. The reality is that our policy, which we'll take to the next election, will enable them to do that. If they sell their home in 10 years and upgrade, that original deposit will go back into their superannuation, plus a share of the capital gain. You can use super and industry funds to invest in social housing or in community housing, but the Labor Party say that you can't use your own money to invest into your own house.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition will continue to talk to people, and not just in my own seat of Petrie. I have had widespread support when I've spoken to people in my own electorate. In fact, I was at a polling booth for the Brisbane City Council elections on Saturday—two days ago—and I was talking to a man in his late 30s. He'd been through a relationship breakdown. He was renting. He'd never owned a house before. He's obviously doing the right thing and paying his ex-partner maintenance for their children and so forth, which is good. When I spoke about superannuation and the opportunity to use a little bit of his super to get a deposit on his first house, he was excited about it because he had quite a bit in super and he just can't save the deposit with everything else that he's doing with his growing family and in the middle of the cost-of-living crisis that we've seen under this Albanese Labor government, with 12 interest rate rises. It's pushed up mortgage payments rents; it's pushed up electricity bills; it's pushed up the cost of food and everything else.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, when we get out there and explain it and talk to people, that's good. I don't know who the member for Kooyong has been talking to when she comes into this place and says she's talking to people. Maybe she is referring to people who are wealthy and who own their own homes and are voting for her. But, I'll tell you what, there are a lot of young people in this country that are excited about our policy. And, in the lead-up to the 2025 election, the coalition will continue to talk to those people—people who need that help, people who want to invest their own money into their own home. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, as the federal member for Petrie, I can say to the government, to everyone in this House and to those in my electorate: I believe in super. It's a good thing. It's a really good thing. We want to continue to talk, and every member in this House should talk about financial literacy and salary sacrifice, and they should promote the programs that the coalition started and that the Albanese Labor government are continuing—and I'll put it right on the front of my website, LukeHowarth.com.au—the First Home Super Saver Scheme, the First Home Loan Deposit Scheme, the Family Home Guarantee, offering a two per cent deposit for single parents to get into their own home. That's important. We all have a responsibility to our constituents to want to see them get ahead. We don't have a responsibility just to our donors and what they want or always what our party wants. But we do have a responsibility towards what is in the best interests of our constituents—to help them get ahead. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If the coalition believes in different policies—and I say this to my colleagues—we should continue to fight for that. John Howard did that, going back to the GST. It was defeated in 1993 and then they revisited it in 1996 and they took it to an election. Unlike this government, they took the GST to an election, won that election and implemented it. And it has actually been a bonanza for the states and it has actually been fairly good policy. </span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms PAYNE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canberra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:51</span>):  I'm very pleased to have this opportunity to speak on a bill legislating the objective of superannuation, the Superannuation (Objective) Bill 2023. It's a bill that builds on a proud Labor legacy of Australia's superannuation system—a system renowned across the world, a transformative system which has changed the lives of millions of Australians as they enter retirement. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Superannuation is the definition of Australian values in action. It is a statement that when you work hard throughout your life, when you contribute to your nation, your financial security should be assured in your retirement. And, alongside your own savings, and our age pension system, this is exactly what superannuation guarantees for Australians. Through compounding interest, Australians entering the workforce today will have the comfort that, when they eventually retire, their lifetime of hard work will be rewarded. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Hawke and Keating established superannuation because they knew that Australians at that time did not have that comfort. Super is a scheme which takes significant pressure off the pension system, allowing government funds to go to those who need it most. Because the Hawke and Keating governments also knew that Australians were living longer after retirement and that the cost to the public purse of supporting the ageing population would only increase, and that more people would need support in retirement, superannuation was fundamentally long-term responsible decision-making. And what a success it has been. Our super system today is worth over $3 trillion. That's $3 trillion of economic security for Australian workers, $3 trillion of smart, proven future-planning brought to you by the Australian Labor Party. This is a system that has been so successful that Australia now has the third-largest pool of retirement savings in the world. As a share of GDP, our private retirement savings outrank those of the US, the UK and Canada. It is a policy success that cannot be rivalled. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill legislates for the first time the objective of Australia's superannuation system. What is that objective? This bill sets out the objective of superannuation: 'to preserve savings to deliver income for a dignified retirement, alongside government support, in an equitable and sustainable way.’ This is very important. This objective, in the words of the Treasurer, serves as a reminder that achieving better living standards for Australians in retirement is at the heart of the superannuation system, and that future policy changes should be compatible with the legislated objective.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So why is this bill necessary? In 2014 the Financial System Inquiry recommended that the parliament legislate an objective for superannuation. The inquiry suggested that this would deliver better outcomes and a more seamless experience for superannuation members throughout their lives. In their final report, they said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The superannuation system does not have a consistent set of policies that work towards common objectives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">…   …   …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The lack of an agreed policy framework and objectives reduces the efficiency of the system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They continued:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The absence of agreed objectives contributes to short-term ad hoc policy making. It adds complexity, imposes unnecessary costs on superannuation funds and their members, and undermines long-term confidence in the system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This was the exact experience during the long decade of coalition rule. We know that those opposite have an ideological obsession with destroying Australia's superannuation system. They hate that something that Labor implemented and that Labor improves when we're in government has been so successful. They hate that the union movement are associated with the best-performing funds, the industry super funds, so they seek to undermine the system at every opportunity in every way, regardless of the fact that Australian workers love our super system and deeply appreciate the financial security it delivers for them in retirement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">During the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government, we saw multiple attempts at this undermining, whether it was the misleadingly named 'your future, your super' bill, which would have stapled up to three million Australians to underperforming funds for life, or the COVID-era decision to force around three million Australians doing it tough to draw down $37.8 billion worth of their own super so the government could get away with lacklustre support. On this measure particularly, safeguards were totally lacking, and as a result we saw far too many stories of Australians on low incomes withdrawing their super funds and using that money for short-term needs that undermined their financial security in retirement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is what those opposite miss about superannuation, and the member for Petrie has just given a speech on this. I agree with him wholeheartedly on one point, and that is that superannuation is your money. It belongs to Australians. Of course it does. What it's not there for is for governments to use it whenever they feel like using it to address a problem, making the poorest Australians—those on low incomes, those who need it most in their retirement—to undermine it early on in their savings journey. During COVID, when young people withdrew from their super, it would have been worth so much more to them in their retirement than it was at that time because of the compounding interest. This is the whole point of superannuation, and the whole point is that those with the least stability to make that decision at the time—because they need that money now—are those who most need it in retirement. These are the policies that undermine that future for them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There was also the plan to force first home buyers to raid their retirement savings to scrape a deposit together for a home. This is a perennial favourite of the coalition, and it keeps on coming up. This is exactly what I'm talking about. Of course, there was possibly the most egregious attempt: the idea that was floated to force women fleeing domestic violence to draw down their super to escape from their abusers. It was perhaps one of the most tone-deaf policies of the Morrison government, and it was abandoned following one of the most incredible speeches I've witnessed in my time here from my dear friend the late Peta Murphy, the former member for Dunkley. She killed off that disastrous policy in just 90 seconds, because, in Peta's own words, 'When Australians are forced to raid from their future to survive their present, the government is failing them.' I couldn't articulate it as clearly as Peta did there, but that's exactly the problem and why they just don't get it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The key theme in all of these half-baked failed policies is that the coalition sees super savings as a way to avoid government expenditure. They see it as a way to make their books look better, with zero regard for the future of Australian workers. Many of these attempts to undermine superannuation have disproportionately impacted Australian women, and we already know that women are retiring with $136,000 less in their super accounts than men on average.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese Labor government has decided that enough is enough, and we are working hard to ensure that this superannuation gap is closed, including with our announcement the week before last that we will be paying superannuation on the Paid Parental Leave scheme. This is an incredibly welcome change and something that women have campaigned for for many years and again builds on another proud Labor legacy, which is our Paid Parental Leave scheme, introduced under the Gillard government and social security minister Jenny Macklin. We are working to close the superannuation gap by introducing this bill to safeguard Australian women's and indeed all Australians' superannuation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What does this bill require going forward? The bill requires that members of parliament who introduce a bill which proposes changes to the superannuation system shall provide a statement of compatibility which explains how the bill is compatible with the objective we're legislating today. The bill also requires that makers of regulations related to superannuation publish a statement of compatibility which explains how the regulations are compatible with the legislated objective of superannuation. This strikes the right balance of accountability to ensure that changes to the super system are consistent with the objectives while providing flexibility for ministers to prepare fit-for-purpose statements depending on the nature and complexity of future measures relating to superannuation. It complements other measures that the Albanese Labor government is implementing to improve the financial wellbeing of Australian workers. One of these measures that I am most proud of, as I mentioned, is the recent announcement to pay superannuation on paid parental leave. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But we have done a lot in our relatively short time in government to ensure that wages are on the increase. Unlike those opposite, it is not a deliberate policy of ours to keep wages low. Also, our recent announcement of tax cuts means that Australians will be not only earning more but also keeping more of what they earn. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I touched on earlier, we know that in Australia women on average retire with a super balance of up to 40 per cent less than men. A large part of why this is an issue is that women are primarily still the ones taking a majority of time off to care for families, leading them to miss valuable super accumulation earlier in their careers. Labor wants the disparity to end. Of course those opposite don't understand this objective of super that we're talking about, so it doesn't surprise me that the natural reaction to our paid parental leave policy initially was to not be supportive. Labor is the party of super, and we always will be. We will always act to protect it. We will always block attempts to undermine it. This bill future-proofs the superannuation system so that it continues to benefit all Australians. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Ryan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:02</span>):  In 2015 the Liberals commissioned the Murray review into superannuation. That's the origin of this legislation, the Superannuation (Objective) Bill 2023. Murray said that the parliament should make it clear what the objectives of our superannuation system are. The coalition, while working to enact this objective into law, was never able to get internal consensus on what the purpose of super is, so no legislation was ever introduced. However, the Labor Party committed to, if elected, enshrine an objective into law. While this legislated objective does not affect any law or enforce any enforceability upon anyone, the following proposed objective is intended to guide future governments and parliaments: 'The objective of superannuation is to preserve savings to deliver income for a dignified retirement alongside government support in an equitable and sustainable way'. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a few problems with this definition. It assumes that the super system is equitable, when it is far from that. It is Australia's biggest homegrown tax haven, actually, where large amounts of excess income can be parked and accumulate sheltered from our tax system. The list of inequitable policy settings in our superannuation system is quite a long one. Our super system is regressive, with a flat tax rate of 15 per cent, which benefits wealthier earners over lower-income workers, who receive no tax benefit. The high concessional and non-concessional cap settings, the exemption from capital gains tax in retirement, the $250,000 level where high income tax rates kick in, carry-forward contributions and spousal contributions are all geared to benefit high-income households. There are a thousand and one little systems and quirks, like cycling income through transition-to-retirement schemes, with financial planners very well placed to help their clients minimise their tax. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other major concern that the Greens have with this proposed definition is that it's silent on where our superannuation is actually invested. We believe that one of the clear objectives of super should be to direct this $3.7 trillion pool of savings into productive investments that improve the quality of life for all Australians, instead of just speculating on the stock market and forcing investments into coal and gas companies, as currently happens under the existing performance test benchmark. Instead of using our nation's savings to chase other speculators around the stock market paddock—that's what happens—which doesn't do anything in the real economy, our super should be encouraged towards productive investment in clean energy, clean technologies, affordable housing, expanded public transport networks and all the things that actually improve society, improve people's lives, protect us from the ravages of the climate crisis and advance our quality of life.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation won't do anything to improve equity or to get capital away from speculative parts of the economy and into productive parts of the economy. However, the bill won't actually make any of this worse, either, so the Greens will reserve our position in the Senate.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bruce</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:06</span>):  The Superannuation (Objective) Bill 2023 will legislate an objective to superannuation, and that will serve for years to come—for decades—as a guide to policymakers, to governments now and in the future, to regulators, to industry and to the wider community. A legislated objective—a new law, a legal objective for superannuation—would be 'to preserve savings to deliver income for a dignified retirement alongside government support in an equitable and sustainable way'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, there are many other positive, beneficial outcomes from Australia's world-leading superannuation system, now a multitrillion-dollar pool of capital: fiscal sustainability for the country in coming decades, reduced costs of international borrowings and so on. But the legislation before the parliament, if passed, will make clear to governments now and in the future that the primary objective, the shared goal, the fundamental point of superannuation is to provide for a dignified retirement, not to allow future lazy Liberal governments to avoid their own responsibilities and force people to raid their superannuation to get by, to cover up failures in future Liberal governments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On reflection, it is strange that the legislation has never had this kind of objective. Doing it now will improve transparency and accountability in the system, and it'll provide stability and confidence in the future. Members and funds will have more certainty over future changes through both the accumulation and the retirement phases. The fact is that in Australia now your super is part of your pay—and not just for the elite, either. Decades ago only the lucky few had superannuation, had a dignified retirement. Millions of ordinary working Australians basically fell into something approaching poverty in their retirement because there was no method, no means, no requirement to save for a dignified retirement. Only the higher end of corporate Australia and the upper echelons of the Public Service, the military and so on had that option, that benefit. Everyone else was condemned, from when they retired until they died, to the age pension and whatever few bucks they'd managed to squirrel away. It was the Hawke and Keating Labor governments in the 1980s and 1990s that made these reforms, that gifted us the superannuation system that Australians enjoy today, and a dignified retirement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The previous government's record is consistent with that of every other Liberal government before them. They've always hated superannuation. I've never really understood why they've hated it so much. They've never liked the idea of working Australians having a dignified retirement. At every stage—and the record shows this: through the Fraser opposition and then Fraser government, through the Howard-Peacock-Howard oppositions, through the Howard government and through the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison debacle—when they're in government they try to freeze, nip, tuck and undermine superannuation. They started it in 1974, when the then Whitlam government launched an inquiry into introducing a universal super scheme for Australians, and they've opposed it ever since.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But this time they've got something new. They've got a new silly scare campaign. It's a day ending in 'y'; the Liberal Party have a new silly scare campaign. The opposition are actually claiming that this bill will somehow end early access to superannuation for financial hardship or on compassionate grounds. That is utter rubbish. The bill has no impact whatsoever on existing arrangements for early access for financial hardship or on compassionate grounds. Those arrangements are unchanged by this bill. So, if they are going to oppose it, at least they could try telling the truth and being upfront and consistent about the fact that they just don't like superannuation and they don't like Australians having a dignified retirement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to that core, the fundamental point, there are numerous other benefits and outcomes of the superannuation system beyond just that dignified retirement, important as it is. Firstly, there are really important fiscal reasons that should be recognised, even by the Liberal Party of giant debts and deficits—the trillion dollars of Liberal debt with not enough to show for it and record deficits as far as the eye can see. It's a bit of a contrast with the government, isn't it? We had the first surplus in 15 years, something they never achieved. But, if you look back at the 1980s or thereabouts, there were six or seven workers—six or seven taxpayers—for every retiree. That was how things worked in the country then—a relatively young population. Following the intervening decades, we're now down to around four taxpayers for every retiree, and the projections are that not long from now we'll be down to just three workers paying tax to support every retiree. That ratio doesn't add up for a high-quality country. Successive governments have smoothed that curve a little bit with skilled migration, but that's the reality of the trend.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What that means is more pressure on the pension system, more pressure on the health system and more pressure on the aged-care system. Frankly, either we run down and turn into a country of giant debt and degraded public services or, as Hawke and Keating showed, we put in place a system that allows and provides for the dignified retirement of Australians and takes pressure off the budgets of future societies. It's now a right, not a privilege. Australians often criticise governments for thinking too short-term. It's difficult to think of a policy that was more long-term and more visionary and beneficial to the long-term sustainability of our country and the retirement of working people than the introduction of universal superannuation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second thing—it's not just fiscal sustainability and it's not just a dignified retirement—is that we've also now built up an incredible national savings pool of nearly $3 trillion or thereabouts under management in this country, and that savings pool now reduces our reliance on foreign capital and foreign finance. It's projected to rise to nearly $10 trillion by 2040. That's an incredible national asset. It means that individual Australians—working Australians—will have a better retirement but also that they own more of our national wealth and what Australia produces. This reduces Australia's reliance on foreign sources of finance, and as of about a decade ago, 2013 or 2014, we achieved an incredible milestone in this country because of our superannuation system. For the first time in our modern country's history, Australians owned more stuff overseas in other countries than foreign countries or investors owned in our country. That's a fantastic achievement that has only been made possible through the accumulation of the capital pool in superannuation—the first time in our history. We're a capital-intensive country. We've always welcomed proper, productive foreign investment—not speculation on the housing market but things that actually grow jobs and grow our national wealth and economy—but, because of our superannuation system, we've balanced that out and we own stuff elsewhere. That gives Australians an enormous ability to diversify their investments, to bring profits back home from around the world and to enrich individual Australians and to grow our collective national wealth, but also to hedge against economic shocks. And we can apply this national savings pool to productive assets.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The third thing I will just note in passing is that it lowers the cost of Australian borrowing and actually helps Australian governments maintain our AAA credit rating. The long-term positive fiscal effect on the federal budget actually boosts Australia's international fiscal credibility—nerdy and niche, but true. When international ratings agencies, bond markets and international partners size up countries and they have a good, hard look at them to decide, 'Well, what's your credit rating going to be and how much should you pay? What's your risk rating? How much should you be paying on money that you borrow? What's your interest rate?' they consider whether they've provided for their ageing population and their pension system. It's not rocket science. It's difficult for those opposite to understand, because they always attack super, but most people could understand the point I've just made. Countries with ageing population—look across much of Europe—get themselves into terrible fiscal trouble when they haven't put away superannuation and have an unfunded entitlement system and an ageing population. That combination—an ageing population and fewer taxpayers to support every retiree—is a fiscally toxic combination of higher debt and deficits. It's a bit like having a Liberal government, really. Ratings agencies look at these things. Without Australia's super pool, we'd be far less likely to have and hold a AAA credit rating, and we'd be paying more as Australians—every taxpayer would be paying more—for the Liberal debt that they left.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But why now? Why introduce this objective now? Well, there are a few key reasons. More Australians are reaching retirement age right now than at any other time in our history, and better retirement incomes have never been more important. More Australians right now are transitioning from the accumulation phase into the decumulation phase, the retirement phase of their super, and it's natural that any government—or any sensible government—would wish to strengthen the superannuation system in light of this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If you wrap all this up, the battle lines for superannuation yet again, right here in this parliament with this legislation, are drawn. Labor created superannuation. Labor defends the superannuation system as being good for workers and good for everyday Australians in their retirement but also good for the nation, with that incredible savings pool of over $3 trillion that we can use as a nation to invest in productive businesses and infrastructure here and overseas and reduce our reliance on foreign capital. Labor championed an increase in workers' pay through the legislated increase in superannuation, which the former government were attacking and trying to get rid of. Effectively—you won't be shocked to hear this, so you don't need to be sitting down—they were trying to cut workers' pay, as they always do and as they did: cutting penalty rates, not giving people pay rises and trying to cut superannuation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's another set of reasons, as you can see when you look at those opposite, why it's important that the government legislate an objective—a permanent, abiding objective—for the superannuation system: to provide a dignified retirement for Australians. That's because when those opposite are in government—and now they're trying it even in opposition—they're constantly thinking up ways to trash, undermine and wreck the superannuation system. They did it in COVID. They effectively privatised the first stage of the COVID support, stimulus and recovery work, forcing vulnerable Australians to raid their retirement savings for the then government's own purposes, with a devastating impact on the retirement savings of millions of Australians. Around $38 billion of savings that were meant to last Australians a lifetime were drained out of super accounts in a matter of months. Around one million Australians were forced, when those opposite were in government, to trash all of their superannuation and raid all of their retirement savings, because the former government—this is a word that might freak them out—frankly failed and refused to take the more effective option of socialising the risk by providing proper support to those in need. It was a really shameful exercise. They've still never apologised for it. They've still never said sorry to the million Australians who were forced to draw down their precious and, in many cases, meagre retirement savings to do the job that the then government should have done.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, they're at it again, with possibly the dumbest housing policy you could dream up, their super-for-housing policy, which would raise the cost of housing. You don't make housing more affordable by making it more expensive. There's a tip for free. But that is their policy. It's a good illustration of why we need a legislated objective. If you wanted to introduce something as stupid as their super-for-housing policy, you'd have to actually articulate, in a statement of compliance, what it would do to the dignified retirement of Australians. You'd be forced to have a look at that and not come up with things that are so silly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's a reason that successive prime ministers—Abbott, Turnbull and even Morrison until he freaked out a week before the last election and caved in—and successive finance ministers and housing ministers have rejected this silly idea: because it would push up the cost of housing. If you're a young couple, Deputy Speaker Vamvakinou, going to an auction—if you and Michalis, say, some years ago were going to an auction—and trying to buy your first house and you had your superannuation in your pocket, you'd be bidding up the cost of housing and trashing your retirement savings. It's a gold medal for policy stupidity to achieve two such silly outcomes with one bad policy: trash your retirement savings and push up the cost of housing. Who's the person who wins from this? It's the guy selling the house. You may as well shovel the cash out of your super account into the pocket of the guy selling the house. It's a really bad policy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, to bring it back to the bill, whenever those opposite can they're dreaming up new ways to trash and undermine the superannuation system, hurting the retirement prospects of everyday Australians, pushing up the cost of pensions with fewer and fewer taxpayers to pay them and pushing Australia further into more Liberal debt, more Liberal deficits. And they're potentially increasing the cost of capital and the cost of borrowing for the country when they run up their giant debt and deficits. International ratings agencies would look at us and go, 'You haven't got a proper super system anymore.' So I commend the bill to the House. The primary objective of superannuation is to provide a dignified retirement for Australians, and that's a cause we should all support.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms WARE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hughes</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:21</span>):  I rise to speak on the Superannuation (Objective) Bill 2023. The stated purpose of this bill is to legislate the statutory objective of Australia's superannuation system. In principle, this is supported. It has as its proposed objective to preserve savings to deliver income for a dignified retirement, alongside government support, in an equitable and sustainable way. Again, in principle, that is supported. However, as with anything to do with this government, we need to look at the devil in the detail and we also need to look at the promises this government has already broken in relation to superannuation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Before I head into that territory, I think, after almost 30 years of compulsory superannuation, bringing this bill before the House is an opportunity for us to revisit the fundamentals of superannuation in Australia. I also intend to highlight the way that various superannuation funds have unfortunately, in many instances, jumped into bed with the union movement. This is not in the interests of their members. With more than $3.4 trillion in funds under management, more than Australia's annual GDP, our superannuation system is a key institution in our economy. With that institutional weight comes an institutional responsibility. To understand superannuation today to enact legislation, its intended role in Australia's retirement income system should be considered.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia's retirement income system has traditionally been viewed as having three main components, parts or pillars. Firstly, there's the social security means tested age pension. Secondly, there are the compulsory superannuation contributions. And, thirdly, there are additional private savings. Each pillar interacts with and influences the others. For example, superannuation is counted in the assets test for the age pension for persons who have reached pension age. In addition, income from superannuation is included in the income test for the age pension. In that way, these three pillars all interconnect.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The superannuation guarantee was introduced in 1992. At that time the legislation did not include a statement about the objective, but the then Treasurer said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The levy … will provide a coherent and equitable framework in which retirement incomes objectives can be progressed. It will ensure that, by the beginning of the next century, virtually all employees will be accumulating substantial superannuation savings to help fund their retirement income.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Former Treasurer and Prime Minister Paul Keating described the means tested age pension as a 'basic anti-destitution payment' designed merely to alleviate poverty rather than provide income maintenance for its recipients in the years prior to and at the time the compulsory superannuation was introduced. In his 1991-92 budget speech, John Kerin stressed that the super guarantee's purpose was to 'ensure that all Australians have a secure income in retirement'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When the legislation was introduced in April 1992, John Dawkins called the superannuation guarantee the foundation for income security and higher standards of living in retirement for future generations of retirees. I've been present in this House today, where I've heard the member for Ryan and the member for Bruce make a number of quite outstanding—ridiculous, with respect—comments in relation to the coalition's apparent objection to compulsory superannuation. We absolutely support compulsory superannuation. We support in any way the right of Australians to save for their own retirement and to look after themselves in their retirement. So I think that both the member for Ryan and the member for Bruce, with respect, need to look a bit more carefully at the coalition's attitude towards Australians saving for their own retirement. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But we come now to some of the work that the Albanese Labor government has done in relation to changing superannuation for Australians. At the last election the ALP policy on the National Reconstruction Fund said that it will allocate $15 billion to partner with the private sector, including superannuation funds, to support investments which demonstrate they'll grow the economy and increase employment. Particularly, the government—the then opposition—referred to opportunities to invest in energy and housing. But superannuation is Australians' money. It's the savings of Australian workers. It's not there to be used to prop up already exorbitant government spending. It's not there when the government cannot work out sensible policies on energy and housing. The government should not be having access to Australian workers' money in this way. It is in fact using members' funds, the superannuation savings from Australia, to fund its own spending. This was never the intention when the legislation was introduced way back in 1992.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's quite curious, therefore, given that the government said it wants to use some of the superannuation money for housing, that it will not adopt the coalition's sensible policy of allowing first-home buyers to use their superannuation as collateral for a deposit to assist them into home ownership. So the government will allow Australians, through superannuation and at the discretion of those funds, to invest in other people's housing; but it won't allow Australians to use their own money to invest in their own housing. That's unbelievable. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was never envisaged in those early days of compulsory superannuation that it would be used to plug revenue gaps or to become an alternative source of government spending. That was never the intention, and it should not be the intention today. But this is what we are seeing here with the Labor government's new taxes on superannuation, which I'm about to come to, and its intention to facilitate the super funds to utilise members' funds to pay for energy, housing projects and anything else that the Labor government decides to dream up. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In Australian superannuation schemes, the investor has to accept compulsion in return for the superannuation benefits that belong to the individual. But, again, these are private savings, and this is a crucial part of the superannuation, because at the end of the day it is fundamental that superannuation belongs to Australians. It is Australian workers' money. It's not the government's. It's not the Prime Minister's. It's not the Treasurer's. Superannuation is Australians' money. It's not a piggy bank to be spent or taxed to fill budget holes. In recent years, the objectives and purposes of the superannuation system have been examined on several occasions. On none of those occasions, whether it was the 2014 financial system inquiry or the 2020 retirement income review, did it say that superannuation should be used to simply prop up government spending or to plug a budget black hole whenever the government feels like it. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Overall, the coalition support a legislated objective provided that the objective does not stray from superannuation's primary purpose. An emphasis on supporting retirement incomes for Australia is the driving force of the coalition's thinking on the next priorities for superannuation, but Australians themselves should be making their own decisions about their super. These should not be decisions that are being made by government whenever it simply wants to move some money into another pet project.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I turn now to some of Labor's broken promises on super. In 2022, at the election the government claimed they wanted to end the superannuation wars. A year ago, almost to the day, we instead had the government reignite those wars. Only in the last few months have we seen what those changes really look like: a doubling of taxation on Australians' retirement savings and a new un-indexed annual tax on unrealised capital gains—that's right; unrealised capital gains. The Prime Minister and the Treasurer went to the election promising no changes to superannuation but, in February 2023, have since broken that promise by introducing a new superannuation tax on unrealised capital gains. This is a world-first wealth tax that will hurt, mostly, farmers and family businesses. It's forcing Australians to pay tax on profits on income that has not been realised. The government's failure to index their new superannuation tax means that up to two million young Australians earning average wages today will face a wealth tax, according to analysis of Treasury modelling published in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian</span>. Superannuation belongs to Australians. It is a long-term saving strategy. Australians make decisions on their superannuation based on election promises. These election promises have been broken—more broken election promises.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I turn now to one last issue that the government has not addressed in any of its changes to superannuation: the link between many super funds and unions. Particularly, I commend the work of Senator Andrew Bragg in the other place to highlight, for example, the AEC data from 2021-22, where super funds paid $10 million to unions in political payments. No wonder the government has been silent on this issue. Since 2006 super funds have spent more than $115 million on the trade unions. The CFMEU banked $4.47 million in 2021-22 and $35 million overall. Super funds are retirement homes for Labor politicians, but they are also current cash cows for the unions and Labor. These payments should not occur. They are not in the best interests of the members. They are not in the best interests of Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If we are looking at legislating an objective to superannuation, there are a number of other issues that this government should also be taking up, which include not using Australians' superannuation money to fund their own projects, and they should be calling for a proper investigation into the link between the union movement and many of these superannuation funds. With over $3 trillion in these superannuation funds—$3 trillion of Australians' hard earned money—this is now urgent.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Werriwa</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:34</span>):  Today I rise to discuss the Albanese government's Superannuation (Objective) Bill 2023. I live and serve a diverse seat. Werriwa is home to families that are working towards growing their super as they reach retirement. I also serve those who require the age pension and every day see the importance of a welfare system that has been brought into place and honed by successive Labor governments. The diversity in my area means that having certainty in retirement is vital to my constituents, a certainty that comes from this bill. Despite being a pillar of the Australian retirement system, superannuation has no defined objective. This has led to confusion over how to shape policies that will provide ongoing stability and confidence to Australia's world class superannuation system. The Albanese Labor government seeks to define superannuation's objective as being:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… to preserve savings to deliver income for a dignified retirement, alongside government support, in an equitable and sustainable way …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has worked with the superannuation industry in Australia to ensure all stakeholders are happy. This resulted in over 190 submissions, with strong support from the superannuation industry for the government's bill and the proposed objective. In 2016, the now opposition attempted to legislate an objective for Australia's superannuation system. The previous government's attempts failed, as they didn't consult with the superannuation industry widely enough, only giving nine days to canvass what is a broad and very complex issue. The previous government's attempt at defining super was purely pecuniary and sought to define superannuation as goals to provide income in retirement to substitute or supplement an age pension. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese Labor government recognises that viewing the Australian super industry purely as a financial objective doesn't recognise that all Australians deserve dignity in retirement. The government instead wants to ensure that the objective is to allow for a dignified retirement for all Australians and to ensure that the superannuation system is equitable and sustainable while achieving this. Future changes to super will also have to ensure that they deliver on these objectives. This will require a statement of compatibility, ensuring that all changes to super going forward deliver to Australians the dignified retirement that they have earned and that the changes are sustainable and equitable. The bill does not change the core obligations for trustees under superannuation law, and ultimately superannuation firms will still have to provide the best financial advice and services to the customer, as is required now. The bill ensures future governments will need to work to make sure that the superannuation system stays fair, sustainable and equitable and is a tool to ensure the dignity of all Australians, not the wealth of some.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government is dedicated to ensuring that all Australians retire with dignity and to making sure that our welfare systems are up for the task. The government has worked with the superannuation industry and will make sure that our plan will benefit everyone. Almost all Australians have a super account, and making sure that their account and the super industry works for them is vital to the nation's prosperity. I commend the bill to the House. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="235654" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr WOLAHAN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Menzies</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:37</span>):  I rise to speak to the bill before the House, the Superannuation (Objective) Bill 2023. It's sometimes easy in this place to gloss over the actual wording of what we're seeking to pass and the consequences of that wording. We'll often see—and it's no criticism of either side—a tit for tat about how what a particular party does in government is great and what a particular opposition is proposing is terrible. We'll see a lot of that in amongst serious contributions, and that has occurred on this debate. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to take you to the actual words here in the bill. In section 5 it actually has the nub of what we've been asked to consider, which is the objective of superannuation. It says here in subsection 5(1):</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The objective of superannuation is to preserve savings to deliver income for a dignified retirement, alongside government support, in an equitable and sustainable way.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For those listening or watching at home, Australia has long prided itself in a bipartisan way on our three-pillar retirement system. What is the three-pillar retirement system? It is as follows. Pillar 1 is a sustainable and equitable pension system for those that need it, an important safety net that we all pride ourselves on supporting in this nation. Pillar 2 is a superannuation system, and that is what we are discussing here: how will the superannuation system be consistent with a purpose that we can agree on and that is sustainable and equitable, according to section 5?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But this part in section 5(1) leaves something out. It acknowledges those first two pillars; it says the objective is to preserve superannuation alongside government support. But it doesn't acknowledge the third pillar, a dignified retirement, which should have bipartisan support—that is, the equity that people can save through their lives and draw upon. There's no more important or substantial equity that people can save for and draw upon in a secure retirement than their own home.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian dream means many different things to many different people, but for most people, when they think of a life in retirement that is secure and that gives them comfort, their own home is high on that list. That's not just an emotional bond. Your own home gives you financial security later in life. It's equity you can draw upon. The idea is that you can go to sleep without another person who has an interest in your property telling you what you can do or whether you can stay there. For those who are just on their pension and do own their own home, the combination of those two are essential for a secure retirement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But, if you look at section 5(1) as drafted, it's a two-pillar retirement system. Why is that? Why is it leaving that third part out? That's really what this bill is designed to do: it's designed to strike a dagger in the heart of any idea that people can choose what to do with their own superannuation. The coalition isn't telling anyone what they have to do. We are merely saying, 'Why can't people choose where their money goes?' because that's what superannuation is: it's their money. It's not the government's money; it's their money. They worked hard for it; they earnt it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Many have, with great flair and invective, criticised the previous government for the moment where people could draw down on super when they needed it most. I was one of those people. I'll tell you why: I was in one of those professions that was shut down. So, instead of relying on government support, I drew on my own savings to keep a roof over our head and to provide for my children. Many people in small business and many people in professions where they didn't work for the government or work for a large corporation carried themselves—that's what got them through. To stand over there and criticise that decision is the height of arrogance. It's the height of arrogance because what it's saying is that you know better—the government knows better than what people will do with their own money and their own choices that they make.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to come back to the actual wording here again and go to the second part. There's a three-pillar system, and this talks about two—not three. But then it says 'alongside government support, in an equitable and sustainable way'. Those words sound benign and those words sound like something that reasonable people can agree on. Those words are either of consequence, meaning that they have power, or they are meaningless—they are redundant. Now, if we are using this purpose and this particular section just to give a motherhood statement that has no power, then we shouldn't be doing that. That's not what bills are for. But, if it has real power, then what is that power—what is that consequence? We should go to that. So, if you go to section 5(2), it says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This section does not affect:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">(a) the operation of any law of the Commonwealth (other than this Act or regulations made under this Act); or</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">(b) the operation of the governing rules (within the meaning of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993)</span> …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The explanatory memorandum is important to read alongside the actual bill. It says in section 1.71 on procedural matters: 'The statement of compatibility'—which I just read out—'will not be binding on any court or tribunal.' That first sentence makes it appear that this is more motherhood than power. But then it says the following: 'This is not intended to exclude the operation of section 15AB of the Acts Interpretation Act, which deals with intrinsic materials'—such as this explanatory memorandum—'in the interpretation of an Act or legislative instrument.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Acts Interpretation Act, for those who are listening at home, is an act that covers and flows through all of our legislation and assists courts and tribunals in interpreting many things. One of them is resolving ambiguity. As clever and competent and professional as this place and the wonderful staff who help draft bills which become acts are, there is ambiguity. That's why we have courts to help us resolve ambiguity. So, in coming to these words 'in an equitable and sustainable way', because those words mean many different things to many different people, there is necessarily ambiguity that will have to be resolved and potentially future court cases on decisions made by the executive or matters appealed through other courts and through the tribunals that we have. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What's the point of that? Why does that matter? It matters because it goes to the real power that is contained within this bill. It's not just a statement of something that reasonable people can agree with on a superficial level. It has a consequence for the future parliament, future ministers acting in good faith on election promises or on commitments to resolve and improve superannuation. The bill says that the relevant minister will have to have a statement of compatibility. When you look at the explanatory memorandum and you see that 15AB of the Acts Interpretation Act allows a court to consider the purpose to resolve ambiguity, that is of consequence. The two words that are of consequence are 'equitable and sustainable way'. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to turn to the word 'equitable'. Equitable means many different things to many different people and many political parties. I am proud of my political party's heritage on focusing on equality of opportunity. I don't want to speak for those opposite, but I'm sure they are proud of their party's commitment to equality of outcome. They're two different historical traditions of what equity means. That's not resolved here at all. If you go to the explanatory memorandum, on page 8, from 1.39, it says in 1.40, 'While equity is a subjective concept', and it talks about it meaning different things to different people. In 1.41 it notes differences in demographic factors and structural inequities. Then there is this sentence: 'This includes intergenerational inequity and outcomes for different groups, including women, First Nations Australians, vulnerable members and low-income earners.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, when you look at one version of equity, if you look at groups rather than individuals, those inequities exist. But what this bill does, and what that section does with section 15AB of the Acts Interpretation Act, is that it risks ambiguity being resolved in a political way, not by people in this place, not by ministers, but by those in the courts who will be asked to resolve hard, complex cases about what this particular provision means. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What does that have in common with the original criticism that I put that this is a two-pillar retirement system, not a three-pillar retirement system? It is about trust in the people and then trust in the people that they send here to make decisions on their behalf. That's all it is. Do we trust our fellow Australians to make decisions on their own financial affairs, or don't we? If we don't trust them, let's at least be honest about it. Let's be honest about the lack of trust in Australians making decisions for their own affairs. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Both sides are proud of our superannuation system. Some tribal politics have been used in speeches here to claim that only one side of politics supports super, but the key difference between us is about trusting Australians to decide how their money is spent. That is something that we should always turn our mind to and that we should always defend. That third pillar of a secure retirement and equity in your own home is a key part of the Australian dream. Right now that Australian dream is in deep trouble, and all of us need to work much harder to improve that. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One factor—and the housing crisis is a complex issue—is having a proportionate number of migrants. I am a proud migrant. Two-thirds of my electorate is first- and second-generation migrants. It is migrants that are emailing me, calling my office, and speaking to me on the doorsteps and on the phones, saying that it has to be proportionate. Again, for those who would like to make political hay with that, if the number is now right, at 500,000 or 600,000, why didn't you say it was wrong when it was at 250,000 or 125,000? Of course, supply and demand matter when it comes to housing, and at the moment there is a disproportionate number of migrants coming to this country. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The proportion matters in terms of our capacity to build houses and infrastructure like schools and hospitals and our capacity to preserve green space. All of these things are what make our society one that is worth living in. We need to make sure that that proportion is right. Right now it's out of whack. That isn't just key for making sure that this is a society that people want to live in. It's also the social licence for our migration system, which we all support. That social licence comes with it being proportionate, and right now the government needs to recognise that it is not proportionate. We need to make sure that it matches the capacity for housing, infrastructure—schools, hospitals—and green space. </span>

I've listened to some of the contributions here, and it frankly breaks my heart that the coalition seems unable to support a single superannuation bill that is put before this House—for what has been almost decades now. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, I am delighted to rise in this chamber to support this bill on a policy made universal and compulsory by the former Keating Labor government. Superannuation has a long history in Australia. The super guarantee laws passed through this very House in 1992. Mr Keating was able to see that the number of those reaching retirement age in Australia was going to explode in the coming decades—we know he was right—and that that would result in increased pressure on age pension payments and put additional strain on the economy. That was going to present some challenges, and one of the great solutions to those challenges was superannuation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note the three pillars of a secure retirement, which were explained, perhaps incorrectly, by members opposite a moment ago. The first was to ensure that we had a social security age pension. That's a great thing. The second component was the compulsory superannuation contributions, and the third part was additional private savings. Working together, they would make sure that Australians had a comfortable income and some dignity in retirement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a fundamental disconnect and misunderstanding in this House about what superannuation is, and that is tragic. One can only assume that there is some deliberate misunderstanding going on here. Despite those opposite purporting to know about the three pillars of a secure retirement, they have taken absolutely every opportunity to undermine superannuation in Australia—to undermine the very intention of superannuation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's go back to the Howard government's freezing of the planned increases in contributions. It exploded over the past decade when the former government allowed—and, indeed, strongly encouraged—Australians to raid their own super funds with reckless abandon and lifelong detrimental impacts. I think that's what people really need to understand here. This is not just an impact for now, particularly for women—I'll come to this point later—who already have more than 25 per cent lower superannuation balances than men. If you raid that super fund now, you never, ever, ever catch up. You're already behind the eight ball, and you will never catch up. What a depressing outcome. But that is exactly the reckless-abandon behaviours of people opposite who like to appeal to populous ideologies about this.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">During the COVID pandemic we saw exactly what would happen. The former Morrison government strongly encouraged people to go out there and withdraw money from their own super funds to stump up for their recovery, rather than asking the government to have an economic stimulus package that was a fairer distribution of the common wealth—the common monies that belong to the Australian citizens. Under the former coalition government's scheme Australians could make initial withdrawals of $10,000 in the first half of 2020 and then a further $10,000 from 1 July. Figures from the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority reveal that, during this short window of 12 months, Australian workers withdrew more than $36 billion from their retirement savings. It means that those Australian workers were not only abandoned by the Morrison government but were then asked to pay for the failure of the Morrison government's policies to protect them during a time of crisis by spending all their superannuation. They will be far worse off in the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On average those who used that scheme under the former coalition government cut their super balances by 51 per cent. In fact, expert analysis of that scheme suggested that those people have now deprived themselves of $120,000 in retirement savings, missing out on compound interest over their working lives. Those who withdrew super moved quickly to spend it. We know that because they were withdrawing on average $1,064 from ATMs, at a time when the use of cash had dropped significantly. The next identifiable expenditure that we could track was gambling, with an average spend of $293 per person on gambling. That's where that money went. Earners of the lowest incomes were most likely to use their withdrawal on the quick cash spends that I was just talking about. People with low incomes and people in regional and remote parts of the country are the groups of people that the former government failed to assist, letting them raid their super funds to make up for failed policies of the other side. Let's not sugar-coat what happened there.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those that were on higher incomes—and I heard the member for Menzies speaking earlier, alleging that he funded himself through his super funds during COVID-19—were more likely to save their money than withdraw it. This unprecedented, short-sighted political attack is a catastrophic blow to the retirement prospects of an entire generation of Australian citizens. Yet those on low incomes are the most disadvantaged—again, let down by the former Morrison government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the following year, in 2021, while women were taking to the streets saying, 'Enough is enough,' speaking out about sexual harassment, sexual assault, and family and domestic violence and calling on the government to do more and be better, the Morrison government, rather than increasing funding and support to those frontline women's services and organisations, announced a plan—it was gobsmacking, I have to say—to say to those women: 'Do you know what? You go and access your own superannuation funds. Your retirement plans can all go out the window now. You go and fund your own safety escape plan now.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The then member for Dunkley, the late and great Peta Murphy, marched straight into this chamber when that policy was announced. She was astounded and outraged, as we all were, at this—yet again—failed policy approach by those opposite. She said at the time:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It defies belief that women who are protesting should not only be glad they're not getting shot but should also have to go into poverty to escape violence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">She said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The response of the Morrison government to women needing to flee violent relationships is to say, 'We know you earn 42 per cent less than men in superannuation, we know that the fastest-growing cohort of homeless people is women over the age of 55, and we know that single women in retirement are more likely to live in poverty than men, but don't worry—if you need to escape a domestic violent relationship, you can draw down on your retirement savings in order to do so.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, the coalition government quickly withdrew that idea. They instead turned their attention to raiding super for housing. So, ahead of the 2022 federal election, the coalition released a housing policy built on the premise that the only way to make sure young Australians can afford a home is to allow them to raid their superannuation funds. Luckily, they were not re-elected.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You would hope that that terrible policy idea would have quietly faded away when they lost government. Instead, just last week the shadow housing and homelessness minister, the member for Deakin, reaffirmed the coalition's commitment to it and flagged that it could indeed be expanded—that they might expand the policy to increase the amount that first home buyers can withdraw. The Super Members Council has slammed the proposal, with modelling showing that property prices could rise by nearly $75,000 across Australia's five largest capital cities—not to mention the fact that it goes against the very principles of superannuation: delivering a dignified retirement to more Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Time and time again the coalition government raided the superannuation system for its own ideological purposes, despite, as I said, those lifelong detrimental impacts on Australian workers. And it will no doubt continue to do so, with this week's confirmation of expanding their ridiculous idea of raiding your super fund now, to cover up 10 years of failure to do anything constructive about addressing the housing crisis in Australia. They throw their hands in the air and say: 'Sorry, we've got nothing to say about how to fix the housing crisis. But do you know what? Do you need some cash? Go and ensure that your retirement is absolutely put in jeopardy, that your chances of retiring in dignity is put in jeopardy by the lack of policy capacity of our members'—those opposite.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is why the bill before the House today is so important. It will go some way to making sure this sort of short-sightedness never happens again. It will enshrine the objective of superannuation in legislation to preserve savings and to deliver income for a dignified retirement, alongside government support, in an equitable and sustainable way. This simple and straightforward objective will serve as a guide for future governments, regulators, industry and the wider community, instilling greater confidence in the system. It will make sure that the focus of super is on the best interests of its members and not of those interested in ideological battles, and it will ensure that any future changes to the superannuation system will support its objective, not supplant or undermine it. Put simply, this bill will secure super's future by embedding its purpose into law, and it will do so by requiring ministers to produce a statement to parliament explaining how any proposed changes to super are compatible with its legislated purposes. Policymakers will be held to account, and that's a good thing. They'll be held to account when considering changes that affect Australians' retirement savings.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The objective will not alter superannuation trustees' existing obligations. Super funds will continue to be required to make investment decisions in the best financial interests of their members. This legislation also doesn't change the ability of members to get early access to their super on genuine compassionate grounds or in cases of genuine financial hardship. They are absolutely legitimate reasons for early access to super funds. For trustees, the objective will serve as a reminder of their role to support members during their working life and into retirement, and, with more Australians approaching retirement age than at any other time in our history, delivering better retirement incomes has never been more important. It is astonishingly shortsighted, and not just that but utterly reckless, for those opposite to suggest that we should just be raiding these super funds at this time in history.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill's an important step towards making a stronger super system for a stronger economy, and it has been met with strong industry support. I want to thank the industry for their engagement. Built by Labor, the now $3.5 trillion superannuation system is the fourth-largest pool of retirement savings in the world. I'm very proud to be part of the party that built superannuation. We will protect it and make it the best it can be, to ensure that it continues to deliver dignity in retirement for generations of Australians to come.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Higgins</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:07</span>):  The growth of Australia's world-class superannuation system is a major economic and civil achievement of the past 30 years. While there are shortfalls for some groups—like older women, for example—that need to be addressed, Australian wage earners will increasingly finish their working lives with super balances that will allow them to plan for a dignified retirement. Super works together with the means-tested age pension and private savings as the three pillars that provide income for retirement. However, there has not been a broadly agreed upon purpose for the super scheme, making it possible for variations on the use of the super scheme to be enacted. An example was the early access to super that occurred during 2020 in the early days of the pandemic. While this was of benefit to some participants in keeping up with mortgages and expenses, it was poorly designed and resulted in thousands of young Australians draining their super and effectively losing the benefits of compound interest.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation codifies a shared purpose, a true north, for super, as follows. The objective is:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… to preserve savings to deliver income for a dignified retirement, alongside government support, in an equitable and sustainable way.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Legislating an objective of super will provide stability and confidence to policymakers, regulators, industry and the community that changes to super policy will be aligned with the purpose of the system. It will also ensure that members and funds have more certainty over future changes to the super system throughout both the accumulation and retirement phases.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">How will it work? Policymakers will be required to assess future changes to super legislation for compatibility with this objective. The terms used in the proposed objective are worth exploring. 'Preserve savings' means that super savings should not be accessed for purposes outside of retirement income, apart from truly exceptional circumstances—and draining your super for cosmetic surgery is not one of them. This recognises that super exists as a savings vehicle to provide income in retirement and is not a pool of individual savings to meet other lifetime costs prior to retirement. When savings are preserved, the compound returns on super help an individual's savings to grow over a longer period of time. That's the benefit of compounding interest. Young workers who cleared out their super balances in 2020 will miss out on these gains. The bill has no impact on existing arrangements for early access due to financial hardship or on compassionate grounds. These are unchanged.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">'Deliver income' means super savings should be drawn down to provide individuals with a source of income during their retirement. The focus on delivering income in the objective makes it clear that super is not for tax minimisation. The inclusion of 'dignified' in the objective indicates that there is a certain standard of living in retirement which the super system should strive to deliver for Australians, alongside government support. 'Dignified' also reinforces the concept of delivering income and clarifies the need for trustees to ensure that they know their members' needs and support members to optimise their standard of living in the retirement phase. It's all about preserving a standard of living that Australians rightfully expect in retirement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As Australia's super system continues to mature over time, more individuals are expected to retire with larger super balances, but many Australians will continue to rely on government support to achieve that level of dignity. The inclusion of 'equitable' in the objective reflects that super policy can have a distributional impact across Australian society, and policymakers need to be aware of these impacts when making changes to this system. 'Sustainable' signifies that the super system should be robust to demographic and economic change and cost effective in achieving its objective. That speaks to intergenerational equity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is significant public attention paid to the accumulation phase in super in comparison to the retirement phase—for example, to public identification of underperforming funds. The super objective clarifies that super is about income in retirement. Australians will benefit from better information and guidance as they enter the retirement phase. This could be a follow-on from enshrining the objective. The objective will serve as a reminder that achieving better living standards for Australians in retirement is at the heart of the super system and that future policy changes should be compatible with this objective. I commend this bill to the House.</span>

It has been a good one. The Superannuation (Objective) Bill 2023 defines the objective of superannuation in law, saying it is 'to preserve savings to deliver income for a dignified retirement, alongside government support, in an equitable and sustainable way'. This clear, simple objective will guide future governments, regulators, the industry and community and instil confidence in the superannuation system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia has got a world-class superannuation system. It's envied the world over. Whenever people come to Australia, one of the first things they want to ask us about is how we got the system and how they can copy it. But there are some issues, and, for the last decade, super policy has been confused, chaotic and costly to members. The worst of this chaos saw the coalition, when in government, raiding the super system for their own purposes, which saw around $36 billion in savings drained from super—savings meant to last a lifetime. Legislating an objective of super will make sure that that kind of short-sightedness never happens again and that there will be some discipline in the way this parliament debates future propositions of that sort, ensuring the aim and the focus of super is in the best interests of members, not those interested in having an ideological battle.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The objective will help guarantee super delivers on its fundamental promise of providing a dignified retirement for more Australians and secure its future by embedding its purpose in law. It will enshrine the core goal of supporting delivery of retirement incomes in law, ensuring that any future superannuation changes support and not supplant this objective. Once past, should any minister propose changes to super, they'll be required to produce a statement to parliament explaining how any changes are compatible with super's purpose, where policymakers will be held to account when considering changes that affect Australians' retirement savings. That, after all, is what it's all about.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The objective does not alter existing trustee obligations. Funds will still be required to act in the best financial interests of their members, and the legislation does not change the option for early access to super on compassionate grounds, as many speakers have already commented on, so I won't go back over that ground. With more Australians approaching retirement age than at any time in our history, delivering better retirement incomes has never been more important. This bill is an important next step towards a stronger super system for a stronger economy, and it has been met with strong industry support.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I listened carefully to the debate within the House, and we can separate out the noise from the way people propose to vote on this. I think it bodes well for the early passage of this bill through both houses, and I welcome that. There'll be other times over the next 12 months where we can debate issues such as super for housing—a proposition that I think is ill conceived, but there will be other times and other debates where this matter can be heard out. We need to have a unified objective for super, and this proposed legislation achieves that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Having a legislated objective of super will help ensure its broader definitions across investment in national economic priorities and strengthening in our financial markets can be maximised. Legislating an objective of super will provide stability and confidence so that any changes to policy will be aligned with the purpose of the superannuation system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You can expect those on this side of the House to be particularly passionate about these issues. We did, in prior governments, build the superannuation system, or protect it, to make sure that it continued to deliver dignity in retirement for generations of Australians to come—something it is already doing and something I hope all members in this House support.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr PEARCE:</span>
                    </a>  Like me! The government wants these three bills to be the only topic of substantive debate in this chamber over the next 72 hours. You may ask yourself why. I'll tell you why: they don't want this debate on this issue because, at the end of the day, we haven't even had the benefit of any substantive committee inquiry. There are three bills here all being debated together. The first bill, the Administrative Review Tribunal Bill 2023, establishes a new federal system of administrative review. The second bill, the Administrative Review Tribunal (Consequential and Transitional Provisions No. 1) Bill 2023, deals with the changes to 138 different Commonwealth acts—138. And the third bill, the Administrative Review Tribunal (Consequential and Transitional Provisions No. 2) Bill 2024, affects 110 different acts. The first two bills have not been the subject of any scrutiny worth the name. And the third has never been examined by a committee at all; the Law Council of Australia has never made submissions about it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have no idea whether these bills are fit for purpose. But we, on this side, are being asked to vote on them. And why? The answer is that they want this House, this week, to approve the transition of one of the largest case loads—if not the largest case load—of any Commonwealth review body we've ever seen, without any detailed examination of whether the transitional arrangements will work. And why? They want this House, this week, to approve this legislation that will require the expenditure of an unknown amount of money—potentially, hundreds of millions of dollars—in the middle of a cost-of-living crisis, without knowing what the actual impact will be. And again we ask the question: why?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To an outsider observing it, it's baffling. So it's worth spending a few minutes explaining why the coalition is not prepared to simply wave this one through and endorse this legislation. At the outset, it's worth saying a few things about the coalition's position as to reform of the AAT. The coalition is not opposed, in principle, to reforms of the Australian system of administrative review, and we do recognise that there are areas where there is legitimate need for reform and improvements could be made. After all, the administrative tribunal is a body that provides a review of government decisions made under about 400 different pieces of Commonwealth legislation. By necessity, its remit is complex and wideranging. It reaches into virtually all portfolios and it deals with matters ranging from tariff concessions to FOI, veterans affairs and national security. That's why this is important.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We recognise that it is almost inevitable that, in a body with such a wideranging suite of responsibilities, over time reforms will be needed. We get that. But developments in the law, unforeseen factors affecting how administrative issues play out on the ground, new interactions between statutes and even simply the march of technology will all, over time, create and throw up new challenges and obstacles. They will require changes to the legislation. We should judge those changes on their merits, and they should be studied in detail.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The issue that we have today, as I have explained, is that we are simply not in a position where we're going to make a judgement call. As to what Labor wants to talk about: in case it wasn't clear, the fact is that this debate has been brought forward in a rush, to distract from things that the government doesn't want to talk about, because the government doesn't want to talk about the fact that, on their watch, families have been slugged with a nine per cent increase in the cost of groceries. Labor doesn't want to talk about the fact that we are experiencing two consecutive quarters of the slowest gross domestic product growth in almost 18 years, outside the pandemic. They don't want to talk about their paralysis in the face of a wave of youth crime. They don't want to talk about their inexcusable bungling and mismanagement of immigration detention, the release of violent criminals onto our streets and into our towns, and their extraordinary concession in the last week that they no longer have control of our migration system. They don't want to talk about the fact that energy prices have gone up more than $1,000 in some regions, despite their promise to reduce them by—what was that number again? That's right: $275.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Instead, we have a debate on legislation that has not been considered, and without the benefit of hearing or testing the evidence. You can't just simply sign off on this without knowing what it does and without having the confidence that it is fit for purpose, as I said earlier, especially when it affects so many laws across the statute book.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It would be an abrogation of our duty as legislators if we were simply to wave this through. We call on the government to allow proper committee inquiries before these bills go to a vote. If these bills do go to a vote this week, as the government apparently intends, let me simply say that the coalition will not rubber stamp the majority of these major changes to our legal system without scrutiny, and we will reserve our position in the Senate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's also worth saying a few words about the AAT and its members. Many of those will line up today and read out the approved talking points, without doubt parroting the government's dubious claim that as many as 85 people serving on the tribunal were associated with the coalition. It is a dubious claim made by the Labor-aligned Australia Institute which has been repeated on the apparent basis that—</span>

                    </a>  They're a little noisy over there, aren't they? Thanks, Deputy Speaker. It is a dubious claim made by the Labor-aligned Australia Institute which has been repeated on the apparent basis that saying it often enough will simply justify whatever the Attorney wants to do. Importantly, it is not a claim about the performance of that body that I spoke about that the Attorney now proposes to abolish. It is not a claim that about the qualifications of the people the Attorney-General will now be purging.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It may surprise people in this place to learn that almost half of the members who currently comprise the tribunal were appointed under the current government. The AAT publishes a list of its statutory appointments and, if you go through that list and sort it out by date, you'll discover that around 160 of the 340-odd members of the AAT were appointed by the current Attorney-General, Mr Dreyfus. All of these 160 will remain after the AAT is abolished. The remaining 180 are not guaranteed a spot. The people who are being targeted are either enrolled as legal practitioners of at least five years standing or have special knowledge or skills relevant to their duties.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As my colleague the member for Berowra has previously pointed out, among the people that the Attorney-General is targeting for purging are people with master's degrees from Ivy League and Oxbridge universities—people with doctorates in law, people with first-class honours and people who are university medallists. These include senior decorated military officers and others who have served in the Australian Defence Force, senior public servants, academics, barristers, partners in law and police officers with decades of experience. They include people who have served on tribunals at a state and territory level. As the member for Berowra has previously said, the people the Attorney-General wanted to target included public servants who have headed up departments and agencies, including public servants who have received the Public Service Medal for their work as a public servant. These include a former deputy registrar of a state supreme court, a former sex discrimination commissioner, the chair of the Australian Accounting Standards Board and the editor of the legal service on practice and procedure for one of the state tribunals. We also acknowledge that there are members of the AAT who have served in parliament or who have served our country through parliamentary service in state or territory legislatures. That in itself should not exclude a person from appointment where they are otherwise qualified. On the contrary, the service to our country through its parliament should be valued and should be respected.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's also worth spending a few minutes addressing the central issue of the tribunal's performance. Ordinarily, when a government body is abolished, it is because there are performance issues that are so deeply entrenched that the only way to address them is to start from scratch. This is why the expense of abolishing and re-establishing the body is justified. It is difficult and certainly not credible to make those claims about the AAT. The last annual report tabled before the Attorney announced his attack on the AAT, the 2021-22 annual report, tells a story of a body meeting or exceeding its benchmarks.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hinkler</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:30</span>):  Over the weekend we had the local government elections in Queensland. I'm always happy to hand out some free advice, and I have some for new councillors and returning ones: stick to roads, rates and rubbish. I think that is what the ratepayers expect—it's what they elect you for—and I hope that into the future that is what the local government elections will result in.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a new mayor in Bundaberg, Helen Blackburn, and in Hervey Bay—the Fraser Coast Regional Council—George Seymour, the former mayor, has been returned. I sent a message to Mr Seymour in which I suggested it looked pretty close, but I think he's won 70-30 or somewhere around there. So congratulations to both of those.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to make very brief comments about the ECQ, the Electoral Commission of Queensland, and the way that this count has been conducted. We have heard reports across the state of voting booths being closed early or running out of ballots, and I have to say that the count has been moving at less than snail's pace. In fact, in some booths, I'm told, they counted postals before they moved to prepolls, where prepolls amounted to tens of thousands of votes. There are a lot of people who put a lot of time into an election, and many elections are close. We have a lot of divisions in my region that are still too close to call, and I think it is incumbent on the ECQ to, quite simply, do better. If they can't, they should give it back to the local councils to run the elections themselves as they did previously. They are more than capable of appointing a returning officer and running a local election for a council.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a number of retiring and non-recontesting councillors, and I want to acknowledge them for their service. They include Jade Wellings, David Lee and David Lewis of the Fraser Coast Regional Council, and Wayne Honor and Tanya McLoughlin of the Bundaberg Regional Council. In fact, Councillor Lee, for his very last event on his very last day as a councillor, attended the Hervey Bay Historical Village and Museum 50th anniversary with me—in Hervey Bay, would you believe?—and there was an extraordinary turnout. The fact that it's been there since 1974 is, quite simply, incredible. Longevity for organisations—for community providers and companies—is very difficult to achieve, and this is an organisation that is run solely by volunteers and has been since its inception. They have a remarkable selection of equipment. So for anyone out there looking for somewhere to go—whether it is vintage machinery or other items that float your boat—please get down to the Hervey Bay Historical Village and Museum. The president, John Anderson, a long-serving member of the Hervey Bay Historical Village and Museum, has done a remarkable job.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to point out just one piece of equipment that was there amongst the vintage machinery, and that is a Cat Diesel Thirty-Five crawler tractor. I'm advised by the member for Flynn, who knows a bit about crawler tractors, equipment and cattle and quite a lot about agriculture, that it is as rare as rocking horse droppings. He didn't actually put it in those terms, but it was close. I don't think it would be quite parliamentary if I used the full term, which is known to many of us. I'm sure the member for Hunter might have heard that before on the odd occasion. So you can go and see a Cat Diesel Thirty-Five crawler tractor at the Hervey Bay Historical Village and Museum, and that is quite something to see.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst I was at Hervey Bay, I went and had a look at the Boundary Road extension, something that the coalition government committed to as part of the Hinkler Regional Deal. It is very near completion. It is a substantial change. It provides another route in Hervey Bay across the city from top to bottom. It is desperately needed, and I want to congratulate Denis Chapman, one of the local councillors, for the work you did lobbying for that road, which is close to completion. As part of the regional deal, construction has also started on the CBD redevelopment, so Hervey Bay will now have a town centre thanks to the regional deal for the Hinkler area, which we negotiated as part of the last coalition government. Very helpfully, of course, the Labor senators came and turned the sod for me. They must have lost my invitation, I have to say, but I'm sure it won't happen again. I'm sure there'll be another opportunity. But it's good to see that these things are coming to fruition, because it makes a difference for the people I represent. That's why we fought for it so hard for so long.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Pialba Bowls Club, under the Stronger Communities Program, received $10,000, which, unfortunately, this Labor government has now cut. For the last round of $150,000 in grant funding, my office received more than $1.1 million in applications. That is how important it is, particularly for regional areas. I would implore the Treasurer: you have an opportunity in the budget to bring it back. That $10,000 meant air-conditioning for the Pialba Bowls Club. For our seniors, who find it difficult in hot times, that is a lifesaver, literally. I congratulate them on the work that they've done.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cunningham</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:35</span>):  I rise tonight to honour the lives of three Cunningham branch members of the mighty Australian Labor Party: Melissa Markham, Betty Marcy and David Goss.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On Thursday 22 February, sadly, we lost Melissa Markham. Melissa is survived by: her sons, Wayne, David and John; their partners, Tanya and Maree; and her deeply cherished grandchildren, Emily, Georgia, Mikayla, Matilda, Harry and Darcie. She is now reunited with her husband and my friend the late Colin Markham. Colin Markham was a longtime member of the state parliament. He also served as Parliamentary Secretary for the Illawarra and was appointed Parliamentary Secretary for Aboriginal Affairs. During this time, Melissa was always by his side, through this very, very public time in their life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">She was a long-time supporter of the ALP and a valuable supporter of numerous campaigns at different levels over the years. Candidates included Norman Wilson, Laurie Kelly, Stewart West and George Peterson, to name just a few. Melissa was involved with fundraising, working on polling booths and letterbox deliveries of how-to-votes for the ALP over the many, many years. Melissa was gentle, kind, caring and extremely thoughtful. She was an extremely generous woman with both herself and her time. She lived her life to the fullest and lived it with such honesty and abundance of love. She was a delight to be around, and her warm presence will be missed dearly. May she rest in peace.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 16 February, sadly, we lost Betty Marcy. Betty is survived by: her children, Linda and Frank; her grandchildren; great-grandchildren; and my friend Nicholas Sands, her nephew. She is now reunited with her husband, Frank Marcy, once more. Betty had a profound love of music and found herself embarking on a phenomenal career in the music industry, from her first performance at the age of five on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Uncle Tom's</span><span style="font-style:italic;">"</span><span style="font-style:italic;">Gang</span><span style="font-style:italic;">"</span> show on radio 2SM to touring all over Sydney and working on television. She sang on so many commercials in Australia that she earned the label 'Queen of Commercials'. She sang on the original Vegemite ad and she was the Throaties bird.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Betty was brought up with a strong political streak, grounded in her position that people are important above everything. She was a very active Labor Party member for many years, when she was always handing out how-to-vote cards and attending rallies with her sister, Eileen Sands, who we lost a number of years ago. Betty's daughter, Linda, said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">She felt passionately about people and their welfare. She marched in many rallies to save Medicare and the ABC, to stop privatization of electricity, stop coal seam gas development … and to stop whatever Tony Abbott was doing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I miss this tiny twosome at our Labor events. Betty was an avid environmental activist and advocate for the ALP. She was always the life of the party and got her happiness from being around people she loved and cared for. She drew people in with her infectious smile and personality, and her presence in the Labor Party will be sorely missed. Betty's favourite farewell was not 'goodbye' but always 'try to have fun', and everyone who knew Betty knows that she lived by this motto to the very end.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 16 February 2024, we lost the wonderful David Goss. David is reunited with his beloved wife, Annie, and their son, Andrew. He will be greatly missed by his family: Cathie, Sarah, Todd, India, Milla and Andie. David was always up for a chat, whether it be about politics, his faith or anything in between. Two weeks prior to his passing I received an email from David. I am honoured to have received this email after writing to him for his 91st birthday, when he shared the following:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I am glad to see the changes in Stage 3 tax which was inevitable. When the circumstances change, I change my conclusions as Keynes noted. All the best to you in the year ahead and keep up the good work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">David was a member of the ALP for an outstanding 71 years and has been inducted into the party's life membership ranks. His tremendous effort within the party will be profoundly missed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Melissa, Betty and David loved their Labor Party, and we loved them back. On behalf of Labor here in Cunningham, we love you, we miss you and may you rest in peace.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="249308" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms PRICE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Durack</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Opposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:39</span>):  I rise today to speak of my great concern for regional Australia and the future of agriculture in this country. I recently joined my colleagues from the coalition agricultural policy committee to do what the Prime Minister and his agricultural minister have failed to do: to actually listen to the Western Australian farmers impacted by the decision to phase out live export of sheep. I joined the committee first in Merredin and then in York, and it was so great to hear from so many locals who came to make their voices heard and to tell us how this reckless decision has affected them. We heard terrible stories of farmers being forced to leave the industry, to sell their sheep at a loss, or, worse yet, having to kill their animals and bury them due to the crisis in the domestic sheep market.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government has fundamentally failed these communities—my communities. They've failed to listen or to consult, and now they refuse to release the report which was meant to detail the future of this industry. Shamefully, that report has been sitting on the agricultural minister's desk for months, and I speculate that that report doesn't say what the government wanted it to, which is the reason it is buried in the in-tray.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The arguments to abolish the live sheep export trade are not based in fact, and I believe this decision is simply a method to win metropolitan votes from the Greens political party. Let's be clear: this is nothing to do with animal welfare.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The WA hearings highlighted the necessity for farmers, young and old, to get organised and to share the reality of the industry today, particularly with urban voters. I'd like to thank my colleagues who travelled all over the West Australian Wheatbelt to hear from our wonderful WA farmers for taking up this fight with us. I'd like to particularly thank the chair of the committee, the member for Grey. During the hearings, the member for Grey highlighted the extensive list of this government's attacks on regional Australia. These range from the abolition of the live sheep trade to cuts on infrastructure, to the introduction of new taxes like the biosecurity levy and, of course, more recently, the family car and ute tax. With these actions, it appears that Labor has forgotten the fundamental importance of agriculture to our nation's prosperity. So many decisions that they have made are making it harder to produce food and fibre in this country. Honestly, do we want to transform from a nation that feeds the world to one that relies on imports to feed ourselves? That is the direction that we are heading in. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite just seem oblivious to the harsh realities of what it's like to produce in regional Australia. Take, for instance, the long period of rainfall deficiency that has decimated so much of my electorate. While a drought has not been formally declared, and recent rainfall may have somewhat helped, the situation still remains dire for many. I have heard from Will Baston, a pastoralist from the Gascoyne Junction, who has described what feels like a never-ending cycle of hardship. In recent years, he and his family have faced fires and floods and now face extremely dry lands. This is occurring at the same time as prices rise and returns fall, which has seen him struggling to keep his animals alive. Will is a councillor on the Shire of Upper Gascoyne and sits on the emergency management committee for the shire. He is extremely concerned for his and other pastoralists' futures. While some stations closer to Carnarvon have had a welcome recent soaking, many other parts of the Gascoyne have only had approximately 10 millimetres in recent weeks, which has only just been enough to keep the dust down and has not soaked in at all. It is my understanding that the soil has now become hydrophobic, due to the long period of dryness, and it will take more effective rain for circumstances to change.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are the types of issues that weigh heavily on the minds of farmers and pastoralists in my electorate. Dealing with the natural environment is hard enough, both professionally and emotionally, and yet this Labor government demonstrates again and again that it wants to make the regulatory environment harder still. The agricultural industry sustains not only our national economy but also our way of life in the regions and in the cities. I say to this government: come and listen to the communities that you are hurting. Start with our WA farmers and all those different businesses in the supply chain. Maybe then you will realise that you need to have policies that support, not hurt, regional WA.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="157125" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms ROBERTS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Pearce</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:45</span>):  I recently spoke in this place about the closures of bank branches and ATMs predominantly by the big four banks in my Pearce electorate. I also raised the consequences of living in a cashless society and ignoring our most vulnerable citizens. Some acknowledgment was given at the time to Bankwest for having more branches accessible to residents of Pearce whilst other banks only had one remaining branch each to service the whole of the Pearce electorate. Imagine the dismay of my constituents in finding out Bankwest have announced they are closing all their branches and ATMs, and will only serve customers online in the future. Residents have told me they're prepared to protest, hold demonstrations and boycott the Commonwealth Bank, such is their anger. This is of great concern, as many of my constituents tell me they do not have either online access or the confidence to use online banking, which they do not trust as they're afraid of being scammed. I cannot say I blame them, as almost daily we are bombarded with news of yet another scam to try and get money from the unwary. We all saw what happened recently when a telco system went down. What did everybody rush to do? Use cash, of course. The same thing happened recently in Perth when the Commonwealth Bank's system went down for several hours.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bankwest was established in 1895, as the Agricultural Bank of Western Australia, by the WA government of the time to service farmers. The bank has a proud history which tells stories of staff sleeping under the stars as they traversed large distances between properties across the state. In 1945 the bank became the Rural and Industries Bank of Western Australia, to better reflect the customers they supported. In 1956 the bank transitioned to support a broader group of customers and became a savings bank. And in 1994, when it became clear their customer base was no longer limited to those in the WA regions and industries, they became the Bank of Western Australia, trading under the name Bankwest.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Bankwest is a commercial business owned by the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, a bank that has already closed its doors on all but one branch in the whole of the Pearce electorate. The Commonwealth Bank has stated that no regional town will lose its last bank branch, and that in regional towns where there is a Bankwest branch but no Commonwealth Bank branch the Bankwest branch will convert to a Commonwealth Bank branch. Bankwest has also stated that customers who currently only use branch services, particularly the elderly and vulnerable customers, will be assisted to move accounts to the Commonwealth Bank and to continue to utilise branch services. Let us hope they can deliver on this commitment, given they have already closed branches of their own. Otherwise, it appears they'll just fob off customers to Australia Post, which, as we know, can only provide a limited service. We need to produce a viable alternative, as I believe we will always have people in our community who, for various reasons, find themselves on the margins, unable to afford the technology or fearful of using it, and who require access to cash.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also need to consider that going cashless is not as straightforward as we think. Experiences in Sweden have highlighted the pitfalls of such thinking, with Sweden showing the need to safeguard access to cash—especially when there has been increasing concern for the elderly, those living in rural areas and people from migrant backgrounds who have been left behind by businesses no longer accepting cash. Britain's government has promised to guarantee access to cash, with the UK Treasury drafting legislation based on the Swedish laws.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Australia, research by the Reserve Bank of Australia from 2019 suggests about a quarter of the population remain high cash users, for whom no longer being able to use cash will be 'a major inconvenience or genuine hardship':</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">These high cash users are more likely to be older, have lower household income, live in regional areas, and/or have limited internet access.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A fully cashless society is often envisaged as inevitable. However, we have a responsibility to learn from the lessons of others and not rush down this path. I urge the banks and businesses across Australia and in my electorate of Pearce to think carefully about the people they serve. I know of many local businesspeople who are now having to travel long distances to access a bank branch, and this is impacting on their businesses' bottom line. I'm also aware that the new announcements about closures have made many in my electorate uncertain about their banking future, and I urge everyone to seek advice so they can make an informed decision about their future banking needs.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="176304" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr STEVENS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Sturt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:50</span>):  Adelaide is the only capital city that has Highway 1 running through its suburbs, and regrettably those suburbs are in my electorate of Sturt. There's an excellent plan to bypass Portrush Road, which carries that heavy freight, around the back of the Adelaide Hills, going from around Monarto up to Truro and then connecting through so that heavy freight that might be going via Adelaide can be carried not through the suburbs but on a sensible heavy carriageway.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The next piece in the puzzle of that is building that Truro Bypass so that we can connect the carriageway that would go from Monarto up to Truro and onto the Sturt Highway and then the Northern Expressway. Under the previous state and federal Liberal governments, that was indeed funded, and it was a project that we all anticipated going ahead. Regrettably, it fell victim to the recent review of infrastructure spending from this government, and funding for the Truro Bypass has been scrapped. That's a really devastating outcome for my community, because putting all that heavy freight through the suburbs of my electorate is dangerous. It also obviously causes congestion. There are schools, residences and a whole range of activities in suburban eastern Adelaide that are affected by that heavy freight, and we want to see that heavy freight out of the suburbs of Adelaide and instead going round the back of the Adelaide Hills.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've recently been part of forming an important campaign on this with my friend and colleague the member for Barker, who has the town of Truro in his electorate. He is as passionate as I am about seeing the Truro Bypass built, because it's good for the town of Truro as much as it's good for the future freight carriageway. We have an excellent community alliance formed, and recently we've launched a petition. I've just ticked over more than 1,000 constituents of mine who have signed this petition because they want to see that carriageway, the Greater Adelaide Freight Bypass, built and they want that heavy freight out of the suburbs of Adelaide. I was born in a hospital not far from Portrush Road. I've lived most of my life—certainly my entire adult life—within a couple of hundred metres of Portrush Road. Indeed, my home today is within 100 metres or less of Portrush Road. I can speak from experience when I say that we have long dreamt of getting that heavy freight out of the eastern suburbs of Adelaide.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To be fair, at times the state Labor government in South Australia have equally expressed support for this vision, and it wasn't the state Labor government that initiated the removal of this funding. We need a partnership with the state government, and I urge the state Liberal Party and Labor Party to both support an important investment decision in that Truro Bypass. But the Commonwealth must be a partner. We need to change the mind of the minister when it comes to this decision, have that decision reversed and have that money put back in.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The CEO of the department recently attended a public rally in Mount Osmond, at the top of the Portrush Road at the toll gate in my electorate. The member for Boothby was at that meeting as well, and I acknowledge that. The department indicated that they are undertaking a deeper planning study on the Truro Bypass and the overall carriageway which will be the Greater Adelaide Freight Bypass. They will do that detailed work to show what the route would be and what needs to be done for it to be built.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is very disappointing that the Truro Bypass has been put in abeyance and the funding has been removed. We want that funding to be reinstated, we want the Truro Bypass to be built and we want to work together with the state government in South Australia, whoever that might be into the future, to build the entirety of that corridor. That will achieve a very important outcome for the city of Adelaide. My electorate is particularly impacted, having Portrush Road effectively as a spine through the middle of my seat. It's got a big impact on other seats like Mayo, Adelaide and Boothby, and that heavy freight would be much better off being on a proper freight corridor going around the back of the Adelaide Hills.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank those in my community that have joined this campaign so far—more than 1,000 constituents. This campaign will keep growing, and we will keep fighting and working together until we get that funding restored for Truro and get those heavy freight trucks off Portrush Road.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="298840" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr REPACHOLI</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hunter</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:55</span>):  It gives me great joy and pride to be able to announce to the House that coalmining in the Hunter is not only alive; it's also thriving. The NSW Minerals Council has released the results of its latest member expenditure survey, and once again the survey has confirmed that mining is helping to provide good secure employment for the people of the Hunter and is the major reason our whole region is able to continue to grow. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The mining industry has helped to support a massive 15,300 jobs in the Hunter. This is an increase of over 1,700 jobs compared to the previous year and the highest number of jobs reported in the 12 years of the survey. The number of jobs isn't the only thing about the mining sector that is continuing to grow and break records. This is also the fourth year in a row that direct mining spending in the Hunter has been over $6 billion. In fact, this year's figures smashed the $6 billion mark, with $8.2 billion of direct mining spending in the Hunter in the last financial year. That's $8.2 billion pumped straight into our economy, straight into our local communities and straight into the Hunter as a whole. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All the money being put into our economy is good, but the part that excites me the most about this report is that, out of the $8.2 billion, $1.9 billion went towards wages and salaries. That's almost $2 billion going straight to hardworking miners to help them put food on the table and keep a roof over the heads of their family. This is money going directly to people in our community and being spent directly in our community. Everyone is a winner.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I expect these figures to be even bigger and better next year with the introduction of our same job, same pay legislation. Before this legislation, miners were being ripped off, getting less than the person next to them for doing the same job. With this legislation, we'll see those in this industry get the fair pay that they deserve. This means only one thing: more money for those who deserve it, which will help our region to grow even more. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On top of more money going to our miners, $6.3 billion went towards goods and services purchased from over 2,700 mining supplier businesses across the Hunter region. The flow-on effect from mining in the Hunter can't be overstated. Mining in the Hunter in the last financial year contributed 25 per cent of the GRP of the Hunter region's economy during this period. Make no mistake: the Hunter is more than just mining. But these figures show that it is one of the pillars that hold up the mighty Hunter region. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was a miner. Many people in my electorate are miners and even more are connected to the industry in some way. Every single person connected to the mining industry has the right to feel proud to be part of coalmining in the Hunter. It has built our region, and, because of mining, the Hunter is able to continue to grow. We owe a lot to mining. It forms an integral part of who we are in the Hunter. But, unfortunately, in this place you hear some oppose coalmining. This opposition is ill-informed and ignores the important facts. Those who want to see the rushed closure of our coalmines wouldn't blink an eye at the 15,000 jobs that would be lost in my electorate alone. They wouldn't care about the $8 billion of lost expenditure. They have no concept of reality—none at all. They just don't get what it is to live in an area like the Hunter, which was built on, and still relies on, the mining industry. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But despite what some may hear, especially around election time, I really do believe that I'm a member of a party who does get it. The Labor Party understands how important mining is. It will always stand up for mining and, more importantly, the miners that this industry relies on. This will not change. Whilst people want to buy our coal, we will always supply our coal to them. This will not change, especially while I'm representing the people of the Hunter.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Calare</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:30</span>):  I rise to pay tribute to the Blayney Shire Local and Family History Group. The dedicated members have completed a vital task of remembrance to ensure that the service and sacrifice of local Boer War veterans will never be forgotten. In 1899, the Boer War commenced and 123 people from Blayney, including two nurses, took up the call to support the Commonwealth's efforts in South Africa. Two of Blayney's much-loved sons, Hector Black and David Ross Crichton, lost their lives in that conflict. By holding chook raffles, balls and even ping pong tournaments, the then 9,000-strong Blayney community banded together to build a memorial lamp post surrounded by drinking troughs which would honour both the Blayney men who gave their lives in the Boer War and the coronation of Edward VII.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the 117 years since the beautiful memorial was dedicated on 2 December 1907, it has been relocated a number of times and, in each of those moves, some pieces didn't go with it, leaving it in desperate need of restoration. After many years of unwavering dedication to see the memorial returned to its former glory, last week, on 13 March 2024, the Blayney Shire Local and Family History Group, led by project manager Iris Dorsett, research officer Rhonda Jones and committee members Kathy Brennan and Helen Dent, invited the local community to Carrington Park for the rededication for the newly restored and reinstated Blayney Boer War memorial. It was a true community occasion, with representatives from Blayney RSL, the Boer War association, Blayney Shire Council and Central Tablelands Water all in attendance, as well as students and teachers from Blayney High School, Blayney Public School, St Joseph's Catholic Primary School, Millthorpe Public School, Carcoar Public School and Neville Public School. After the moving service, it was a privilege to have a chat with Scally Radburn, who kindly showed me some personal items passed on to him by a family member who fought in the Boer War, including a war diary, a prayer book and a campaign belt.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For the Blayney Shire Local and Family History Group, the tremendous day had been 25 years in the making. In 1999, research officer Rhonda Jones led an intensive study into the 121 soldiers and two nurses from the Blayney district that travelled from Blayney to the Boer War. She uncovered not only their names but their stories, which have been published in the book <span style="font-style:italic;">Dear Mother</span>. While this remembrance project was completed thanks to the tireless efforts of the Blayney Shire Local and Family History Group, a big thankyou must also go to Mayor Scott Ferguson, and councillors and staff from Blayney Shire Council, including general manager Mark Dicker, director of infrastructure services Jacob Hogan, works manager Joel Cummings, parks and gardens manager Brian Parker and the hardworking teams from the outdoor services, parks and gardens, workshop and administrative departments. A thankyou must also go to Ian and Roxanne Reeks from ICR Engineering, Mark Wilson of Laser Electrical, Ben and Bec Crombie and their staff from McMurtrie &amp; Co and Steve and Jordan Davis from Dubbo Powder Coating and Sandblasting.</span>

It was great to see for myself how the Stronger Communities grants have helped them upgrade their facilities for the families they support. It was such a pleasure to spend this time with such gorgeous little ones and the educators preparing them for school.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I feel proud and privileged to represent a multicultural community. In February the Greek Festival of Sydney marked 20 years celebrating language, culture and cuisine. What started as a small gathering 43 years ago in Marrickville has turned into a gathering of thousands at Tumbalong Park in Darling Harbour. The Greek community of New South Wales should be proud of what they have created. It is hard to imagine what my electorate of Barton would look like without the contribution of Earlwood's Greek Australians.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many Muslims in Barton have begun observing Ramadan, so many of my constituents have contacted me about the pain of seeing friends, family and loved ones caught up in the conflict in Gaza. For many, their prayers and reflections will be turning to their friends, family and loved ones in the Middle East. There is such grief and pain being felt across the entire community. For all those practising, particularly in the electorate of Barton, I hope the holy month brings ease for you. I hope this period is a reminder for all of us of our shared humanity. I join so many in wishing peace, security and dignity for all of our community.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Flinders</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:36</span>):  I came to this place as a kid in my 20s, on the cusp of the new century. Within my first 12 months in this building, something terribly sad happened. The member for Isaacs, Greg Wilton, took his own life while in office. He was 44. I was a young assistant adviser back then, on the blue carpet. I listened to the condolence motion speeches throughout the day. Question time was cancelled, and the speeches rolled through the afternoon and into the evening. In those speeches, I saw something of the character of the men and women I so greatly admired in this place at that time—John Howard, John Anderson and Tony Abbott, among others. That day, they spoke of their affection for Wilton, a Labor man through to his bootstraps, who had served both the ASU and the NUW. He was a member of the class of 1996. Wilton was pretty friendly with some on our side. Bruce Billson, then the member for Dunkley, referred to him in his condolence speech as 'an electoral neighbour, a colleague and friend'. He said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We had a common boundary between our electorates, which occasionally meant there was friendly and spirited banter between us … but what I remember most about Greg was that we worked alongside and with one another when it was in the interests of our local community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The speeches that day were not just a reflection on Wilton or the odd bit of bipartisanship required to get stuff done here; they were also a reflection on this place and how, at its core, sat a compassion, empathy, goodwill and gratitude towards the 1,800-odd people who have been elected to it. Tony Abbott's words on that condolence motion were particularly strong when he said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… Greg Wilton came with high hopes to what he regarded as the greatest institution in the nation for helping people … and yet … he died of a broken heart.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                <span class="HPS-Small">He hated the character assassination which sadly is so much a part of the public discourse and the private conversation here and for which all of us bear a heavy responsibility.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                <span class="HPS-Small">We often complain about the low public standing of politicians, but other people take us at our own estimation, and we are always running each other down. Of course, there is a place for judgment, and sometimes there is a place for furious denunciation, but I think Australia would be better off without the feral quality which so often contaminates our public lives.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">A few weeks ago, in the pages of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian </span>newspaper, I was referred to as 'a new breed of Liberal'. I can assure the good folk of Flinders I am very much an old breed of Liberal, formed in this place when many of its current inhabitants were still in short pants. It was here I learned the values and practices which sustained stable, mature, responsible and strong leadership in this country for over a decade, the most successful coalition government this country has ever known.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bruce</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:39</span>):  I want to acknowledge that contribution. I was actually also here when Greg Wilton took his own life, and it was a sad day. It's good that those lessons and the words that were said at that time are remembered.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to just have a little chat and share a few thoughts about the Australian Honours and Awards system. The Whitlam government, of course, replaced the British imperial honours system with the Order of Australia back in the 1970s. We had that brief weird foray when Tony Abbott brought back knights and dames, and the country was treated to 'Sir Prince Phillip', which of course was a very sad day for all the comedians in the country, because nothing could ever be funnier! It was, indeed, the death of comedy, some of them said.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Some years ago I met with a terrific organisation, Honour a Woman. They do incredible work promoting gender equality in the Australian honours. That movement began in 2017, after 43 years of men consistently receiving over 70 per cent of Orders of Australia. This year, 2024, saw for the first time 50.5 per cent—so half—of Orders of Australia given to women, which was a terrific milestone and a momentous achievement, and testament to their perseverance. Progress is welcome, but there's more to do. They're back this week campaigning to see women recognised in the higher grades, where they're still underrepresented.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've also opened a discourse about what I see as the gross underrepresentation of multicultural communities and socioeconomically disadvantaged areas such as my electorate. They're dramatically underrepresented. All MPs get a breakdown by electorate of who received Australia's most prestigious awards each time. There were almost a thousand recipients across Australia in the recent list. My electorate got just one: an Australian fire service medal to Ross Sullivan—a terrific contribution. But one was received—no ACs, no AOs, no Ams and no OAMs. In fact, in the last five lists, residents of Bruce got 10 medals in total, all of them very low grades—one OAM in five lists, less than one-third of the Victorian average.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not an isolated example, though. Areas of socioeconomic disadvantage are massively underrepresented among honours recipients, and areas of the highest wealth are massively overrepresented. It raises concerns about elitism and about the process. If you look at Victoria alone, in the 2023 honours list: the electorate of Kooyong—largely a 10 in socioeconomic disadvantage—got 19 awards; Higgins, 24 awards; Goldstein, 16 awards; and areas like mine, two. The electorate of Lawler got zero. The electorate of Gorton got zero. The most disadvantaged electorates get two-fifths of nothing, if anything, and the wealthiest electorates consistently get a massive share of the awards. That's not to diss those contributions, but there's something wrong when people from multicultural suburbs and, frankly, poorer people doing amazing work in communities are not getting recognised.</span>

                  <a href="HWO" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HAWKE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mitchell</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:42</span>):  I rise today to raise the interesting state of schools in my electorate from growth figures that have been released recently and the feedback I've been receiving from principals over many years. New figures from the Department of Education reveal that schools in the Mitchell electorate are bursting at the seams, as they have been for many years. Four of our local public schools—Matthew Pearce, Rouse Hill, Castle Hill and North Kellyville—are ranked amongst the 20 biggest primary schools in the state by enrolment, boasting over a thousand students each. Many people will say this is not new. But there have been demountables at these schools for a long time now, and I'm concerned that public infrastructure spending on public schools isn't adequate to meet the demands in growth areas, including these public schools that are bigger than 1,000.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Castle Hill High School is one of the top three largest public schools in New South Wales, and that is the school, as we know, that has suffered from ancient infrastructure, with asbestos all through it. There are still asbestos issues. It's been cleared by the department, challenged, recleared, challenged, recleared—still no proposed infrastructure spending to lift this 60-year-old infrastructure up to where it needs to be in one of the biggest high schools in the state. What is the spend, and how is it being done by the Department of Education, if it's not being done for the largest and oldest schools with the most difficult infrastructure? There are high schools bigger than Castle Hill High, new ones, but they're brand-new infrastructure, and the dynamic of a growth area and a non-growth area having brand-new schools and old infrastructure is of course a disaster.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The last government announced and committed to the funding and building of the Box Hill public school, and I welcome this. It's being constructed at the moment in a growth area of my electorate. But the priority of the Department of Education to actually go back and fix longstanding older schools and their infrastructure isn't there. A lot of money is spent by the Department of Education in New South Wales every year. There are a lot of people who work for the Department of Education. But what is their program to update and upgrade older-infrastructure schools? Where is it and why isn't it there? It simply isn't sufficient and it simply isn't getting the right results for kids in large and small schools around the state.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've had to have the private sector step in. I've been meeting with independent and private schools who are going to open schools in the north of my electorate at great expense. There's capital being raised to do that, and we welcome that. That's part of our system to ensure those schools are able to open and enhance. But that should not be at the expense of re-updating infrastructure in older schools that are now 60 or 70 years old and clearly out of date. We do need a solution to this. The state government seem to have no apparent plan to fix this infrastructure backlog, and, indeed, they're not keeping up with the current growth. We've got two large schools. We've got older schools with no sufficient pipeline of new infrastructure upgrading. There is a lot of money being spent. Where is it being spent and why? The department needs to take some lessons from the independent, Catholic and other efficient systems on how to spend money and how to prioritise money.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr CHARLTON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Parramatta</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:45</span>):  In language schools across our country, thousands of first generation Australians teach their second generation kids a language other than English. They do this in the hope of keeping their heritage, their culture and their identity alive. On 21 February 2024, countries around the world observed International Mother Language Day. On this day, millions of people celebrated their traditional languages, cultures and customs. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In a multicultural country such as ours, multilingual education is important. International Mother Language Day aims to preserve and protect languages from extinction. Around half of all languages today are classified as endangered, and over 1,500 are expected to go extinct in this century alone. This threat is existential to those communities. With the rising tide of tyranny across the globe, celebrating multilingualism can help inoculate liberal democracies such as ours. We've seen this time and time again. When one group sets out to oppress another, language is often the first victim. As a beacon of multicultural success, Australia must embrace multilingualism in our stand against the global tide of tyranny and illiberalism. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">International Mother Language Day is particularly important to my electorate of Parramatta. Over 60 per cent of people in Parramatta speak a language other than English at home. In fact, Parramatta has the second highest number of multilingual residents in Australia. This makes Parramatta one of the best examples of multiculturalism within Australia. Its success is proof that diversity and tolerance can be among our greatest strengths as a nation. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The 21st of February also marks the day when the Bengalis fought for the recognition of their Bengali language. International Mother Language Day is widely recognised as one of Bangladesh's most successful cultural exports. Members of the Bangladeshi community in my electorate are some of the most passionate advocates for International Mother Language Day. They're proud of their culture and rightfully so. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to acknowledge Riz Chowdhury, who has long championed International Mother Language Day. Riz and I first met during the 2022 federal election campaign, when he volunteered as part of my campaign team. Since then, Riz's positivity and infectious passion for Bangladeshi culture have become a constant across the community in Western Sydney.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HOGAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Page</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Manager of Opposition Business</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:48</span>):  I'd like to acknowledge today and remember the incredible life of local icon, Paul O'Neill. Paul sadly passed away last week at the age of 64. Whether it was the Lismore Speedway, the Marist Brothers Rugby League Club or Lismore Nissan, Paul was passionate about treating everyone like his family, and he loved Lismore.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Paul had an incredibly successful sedan racing career at the Lismore Speedway. He rose through the ranks, becoming one of Australia's most well-known names in the racing scene. He won the Australian Grand National Sedan Championship in two consecutive years, in 1986 and 1987. His greatest victory during his racing career was when he won against the Americans at the Lismore Speedway, as a member of the Australian team. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Joining the Marist Brothers Rugby League Club, Paul helped to turn it into a financially secure club with a strong and successful team of players, and he very much drove it to have a strong community focus. He owned Lismore Nissan, and he had a great passion for excellent service at the dealership, securing 11 years in a row of being awarded the Elite Dealer Excellence Award. Here Paul and his wife, Wendy, worked daily. I'd like to express, on behalf of myself and my wife, Karen, our deepest condolences to Wendy, to Paul Jr and Molly, and to Victoria and Nick. We know that you will miss him deeply, as will many in our community, for the generosity that he showed. Rest in peace, Paul O'Neill.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to acknowledge and thank Maria Pagotto for 44 years of volunteering in our community, including at the St Vincent's hospital in Lismore. Turning 97 this year, Maria has spent her time at the hospital helping patients, staff and the chapel. She first spent time at the hospital as a Red Cross member. Maria did hair and beauty care for rehabilitation patients. She did this for 28 years. She transferred to the day surgery, handing out cups of tea and sandwiches. The patients always noted their happiness because of Maria's dedication in the way she served them. Maria also spent 17 years at the Italian aged care, keeping patients company and looking after them. After transferring to the south Lismore Catholic parish church, Maria spent 15 years volunteering, continuing to become the Eucharistic minister at the Saturday evening mass. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Some of Maria's most cherished achievements include spending 33 years as a member of the Red Cross and receiving the service award in 2004 for 22 years of valuable service, and she is still serving as a volunteer today. I'd like to thank and acknowledge Maria for her important contributions to the local community through her volunteering efforts.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macquarie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:51</span>):  I'm very proud that a sample of the wonderfully creative Mount Vic and Me designer, Kara Cooper, is for sale in the Parliament Shop for the month of March. Her quirky range of Blue Mountains socks includes Gough Whitlam urging 'Time to pull up your socks' and features many other political faces, and also local birds and plants and a true-blue Aussie cattle dog hanging out in the backyard. Mount Vic and Me is a legend at the top of the Blue Mountains and online, with her tea towels and mugs featuring prominent political figures.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Kara is taking part in the Parliament Shop National Showcase, which is the new program to help promote Australian made products from across the country in our own Parliament House shop. It's a collaboration with parliamentarians, and, like so many others, I've shared the invitation to take part with small businesses in my electorate. I'm delighted that her work will be shared by the scores of people who finish a visit to the parliament via the shop, and I'll be urging all my parliamentary colleagues to go and check out the New South Wales showcase for themselves. I look forward to other Macquarie creatives being part of this program when New South Wales is showcased next in September.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to share with the parliament the achievements of one of the recipients of the medal of the Order of Australia, Paul Rogers, who lives in the Hawkesbury. It's particularly pertinent this week because Paul is a committed Rotarian, and most of my dealings with him have been either in his capacity as secretary or president of the Rotary Club of Kurrajong North Richmond and then as assistant governor of Rotary District 9685. Just this weekend, Paul texted me a photo of inbound district exchange students at the district conference, who I'm lucky enough to be hosting in the parliament later this week. As a former Rotary exchange student, I can't wait to hear about their year so far in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Paul's work for Rotary—and also supporting bushfire and flood victims, problem-solving community issues and fundraising for local causes—has been core to the community contribution that I've seen him make in the many years that I've known him. But of course, when you receive an OAM, we get to fill in a lot of gaps from the past, like his role at the Parramatta Community Justice Clinic, his position as a Hawkesbury councillor in the 1990s, his volunteer roles at Hawkesbury Hospital, his directorship of our local Bendigo Bank, his membership of the Hawkesbury catchment management trust and his Scouting commitments. Like so many who receive these awards, it's based not just on one contribution to our community but on a multitude over very many years. There is much more that Paul has done, and it's an absolute delight to be able to acknowledge in this place his contribution to the Hawkesbury and wider community.</span>

We have great suburbs. A few weeks ago, though, in Mango Hill, in Deception Bay, I was joined by a volunteer and some of my staff to clean up graffiti in our electorate. Graffiti is a blight on our community, and it's a poor reflection on our area. The reality is that everyone needs to take greater care in our community, and it starts with simple acts of service.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to thank the people who helped me. I want to thank Didi from Enhance Painting for coming out and helping me paint over some of that graffiti. It was particularly noticeable on Deception Bay Road. It was really bad there and had built up over the years. It was also particularly bad at Mango Hill, down near the Mango Hill Market Place. I think it's important that people paint over this straightaway.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to thank Inspirations Paint at Kippa-Ring, Craig, the owner, and Amanda. Thank you for donating litres of paint to make this possible. They did this previously as well. There was a building at Kippa-Ring that had been sitting vacant for years. It was a commercial building that the owners wouldn't do anything about. The graffiti was completely covering the place, so I said, 'Look, do you mind if I get in and clean it up?' It was on a main road, on the corner of Elizabeth Avenue and Anzac Avenue at Kippa-Ring, and it was a really poor reflection on the community. I got in there with a team of volunteers and painted the whole thing black. It looked brilliant. Painting it black made it a lot easier to repaint over if kids were to tag it again. If it were tagged in white or green, it would be much easier to get out there and tag over it. If you do it immediately, people actually stop tagging it. It remained tag-free for about two years until it was recently renovated into a new commercial premises.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I say to people with private property: please paint back over your fences and back over your commercial buildings if they're tagged. It will stop. I say to the Queensland government: consider murals on the backs of places like the Bruce Highway. I noticed that a lot of the commercial buildings are being tagged there and that the Queensland government isn't doing a good enough job there. There are some TMR properties that aren't being cleaned. You can email Energex at custserv@energex.com.au. If you email the power pole that's being graffitied, they'll come and clean it. You can also call the council as well on 32050555 if you notice graffiti on bus stops and bins. More can be done to help people with art and murals in the community, but, as far as private property goes, let's clean it up and make sure that we have pride in our community.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms THWAITES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Jagajaga</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:57</span>):  At the last election, I was very pleased to be able to commit to delivering a Medicare urgent care clinic to my community. The Heidelberg Medicare urgent care clinic has now been up and running for some time, and it is making a real difference locally. The clinic is there for those times when people need urgent but not life-threatening care or when it's significant enough that you need to see a doctor or a nurse right away but not immediately life-threatening and you don't need to be sit in the emergency department at the local Austin Hospital.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've had so much positive feedback about the difference the Heidelberg Medicare urgent care clinic is making in our community. Earlier this month, I had the chance to visit the clinic with the Minister for Health and Aged Care. We heard from a local constituent named Helen, who told us how she had a fall and ended up with quite a significant cut on her head. She'd then gone to the urgent care clinic for treatment and received six stitches. Helen said to us that, from the receptionists through to the nurses and the doctor who helped her, everyone was so thoughtful and prompt in the care that she received.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We now know that between July 2023 and mid-February 2024, the clinic had more than 10,800 visits from locals. Around 70 per cent of those people who visited the clinic in the last couple of months have said that, if it wasn't there, they would otherwise have gone to the emergency department. We have data on the types of presentations that people are coming to the clinic with, including things like ankle, toe or foot injuries, finger, wrist or hand injuries, and abdominal or stomach pain, vomiting, nausea or fever. They're all serious things but things that people don't need to wait at an emergency department for. This tells us that the clinic is doing exactly what we hoped it would do. It is taking pressure off the emergency department at the Austin Hospital, it is providing an extended service seven days a week for urgent but not life-threatening care, and it is ensuring that people across my community can see a doctor or a nurse when they need to. I'm very proud to have delivered on this important service.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">More broadly, I know we still need to do more work on bulk-billing in my community, because Medicare, as we know, was neglected for nearly a decade under the Liberal and National governments. Our government is trying to rebuild that. I am pleased to say that early figures show our investment in bulk-billing—the largest ever—is making a difference in Jagajaga. In just two months, residents in my community saved $132,000 on 3,187 additional bulk-billed trips to the GP. That's a 3.1 per cent increase. I want it to rise further. I know there is still more work to do so that locals can see a doctor and be bulk-billed when they need to. But it is so important that our government tripled the bulk-billing incentive as part of our work to make bulk-billing more accessible to locals in my community and right around Australia.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It feels that every day we hear news of another climate disaster. The world has recorded its hottest year on record, the seventh mass bleaching of the Barrier Reef is underway, and 30,000 people in Victoria were recently told to leave their homes because of catastrophic fire risk. But, whilst our window to 'keep 1.5 alive' vanishes, we also face a second crisis here in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Cost of living is the issue that dominates every town hall meeting and every poll in every electorate in the country. Whilst many people want to talk about interest rate rises or an unfair rent hike, many others want to talk about their power bills. Over the last year, retail power prices have risen over 20 per cent. These power bills were driven up by our dependence on aging coal plants and expensive gas. But the very real pain that households are feeling is being weaponised by those who seek to blame renewable energy to delay climate action and to pit the regions against the cities in a new culture war. It is more important than ever that our actions to combat the climate crisis also address cost of living.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Luckily enough, we already have the solutions, because over three million households have been shielded from recent energy price rises. They're the ones with solar on the roof. They're people like Nick in Bondi, who installed solar when he renovated his home and is now saving around $150 a month. Nick's story is not unique. The average household with solar saves between $1,100 and $1,800 a year. They have cheap, clean energy off the roof and long-term financial certainty. But the opportunity goes beyond solar. Those who switch out gas appliances for more efficient electrical alternatives can reduce bills by between $500 and $1,600 a year. By fixing up home insulation, we can save even more. These actions are great for cost of living, and, by dramatically reducing our use of fossil fuels, they're also great for the planet. By reducing households' peak demand by up to three-quarters, they also reduce the risk that we overspend on transmission.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But over half of Australia's 11 million households are locked out of these opportunities to permanently reduce their power bills. Renters are six times less likely to have solar than homeowners. Their home is much more likely to have a zero energy star rating, because there's not much incentive for landlords to take action, and there are no laws that can tell them to do so. Renters are left frustrated and out of pocket. Apartment dwellers are 10 times less likely to have solar. They're blocked by financial and regulatory barriers, and we've seen them abandoned by government policy for too long. Those with lower incomes and low savings face additional financial constraints. Too many people are locked out of lower power bills, and too many people in regional and rural Australia are not yet seeing the benefits of the transition. It's not fair, and we need to act.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why I am today calling on the government to fund a people power plan to lower energy bills at the May budget. The plan should include, firstly, support for households who have been left behind, particularly renters, apartment dwellers and those on low savings or with low income. Secondly, it should include support for people in regional and rural Australia, who this transition cannot succeed without. Finally, it should include driving regulatory reform, including an end to new gas connections, minimum standards for rentals and mandatory energy performance disclosure. We need a multiyear, additional funding commitment that supports an additional half a million homes to electrify over the next three years. And it can be paid for by properly taxing windfall profits of the gas industry by lowering the deductions cap on the petroleum resources rent tax to 80 per cent.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bennelong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:05</span>):  I thank the member for Wentworth for moving this important motion today. Like us in government, she understands how important it is to transition our electricity generation away from fossil fuels and ageing infrastructure. She understands this and she supports this, and it's why she won her seat and the Liberal Party didn't.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Energy security is an important issue to discuss. Australians want us to work out the challenge of how we'll meet our energy needs whilst reducing emissions along the way. They voted out a government that had 22 failed energy policies, so we know that this issue matters to everyday Australians. Importantly, we know that Australians also want tangible solutions. They want and need dispatchable energy now—not a nuclear energy fantasy that is decades away. They want a shift away from fossil fuels because they know that low-emissions technology also delivers a reduction in wholesale power prices.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm pleased to inform the Chamber that this wholesale power price reduction is happening right now. In January this year, the Australian Energy Market Operator's update stated:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Record generation from grid-scale renewables and rooftop solar is triggering wholesale energy prices and greenhouse emissions to fall …</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The CEO of the Australian Energy Market Operator, Daniel Westerman, said that wholesale electricity prices on the east coast had halved from 2022 levels, reflecting the increasing roles that low-cost renewables are playing in daily generation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm part of a government that wants as many Australians as possible to access the dividend of renewable energy. Energy-efficient homes are not just beneficial for our environment; they offer tangible benefits for every Australian household. Electrified homes are cheaper to heat and cool, and, crucially, they are more able to access free and clean energy along the way. For people to access these benefits equitably, we know we have a lot of work to do. We need solar, batteries and wind to be accessible for everyone, whether you own your home or you rent, or whether you live on a farm or you live in an apartment. People should be able to access affordable and emissions-free energy no matter where they live.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since coming to government, we have worked incredibly hard to overcome the 10 years of climate denial and delay from those opposite and to get this energy transition on its way. We've been working very hard, and I'd like to also acknowledge the work of the crossbench, including the member for Wentworth, for their work in this space over the last two years. The majority of people elected in this place all want the same thing. We want cheaper energy, we want energy security that's deliverable now and we want the overwhelming majority of that new energy to be renewable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Contrast that to the alternative, to those who wasted their 10 years in government and who have chosen now, in opposition, to pursue their nuclear energy fantasy. With renewables, Labor wants cheaper energy, and the Liberals want nuclear, which has been proven time and time again to be the most expensive form of new power generation. Labor wants to deliver renewable energy now, whereas the Liberals want to wait 10, 15 or 20 years before their first reactor operates. Labor wants our new energy to be clean and emissions free, whereas the Liberals want to extend the life of dirty coal-fired power plants.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To enable renewable energy uptake in homes, we have to date committed over $1 billion to help households electrify. The Household Energy Upgrades Fund will, through financial institutions, offer low-interest and concessional loans to homeowners who want to install energy efficient technology. Not everyone has the $5,000, $10,000 or $20,000 needed to invest in this infrastructure at home. These low-interest loans will make it easier for homes to electrify and access the benefits of renewable energy. Under this plan, the Clean Energy Finance Corporation will partner with private financial institutions to offer concessional green loans, and there has been extensive interest in this program. I'm hopeful that the government can provide further updates throughout the year about these partnerships as we lay the groundwork for the widescale rollout of energy performance upgrades across households. On top of that, importantly, we've offered $300 million to improve energy efficiency in social housing properties across the state. This is just one of many policies that we've rolled out in under two years. We were elected to take action in this space. We have and will continue to do so.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="175696" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms STEGGALL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Warringah</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:10</span>):  I strongly support this practical motion calling for the funding of a people's power plan to accelerate the electrification of households. We are facing the twin challenges of emissions that urgently need to come down and households with high power costs, and this motion tackles both. Firstly, let's acknowledge the climate crisis we are in: 2023 was a year of record temperatures and, so far, in 2024 the temperatures just keep rising. Earlier this year was the hottest January on record in the world's oceans. Secondly, households face a cost-of-living crisis, with high energy prices driven by ageing coal-fired power and expensive gas. The recent ACOSS Heat Survey report indicates that over 1.8 million low-income homes can't afford the electricity to cool or warm their homes, putting them even more at risk of the health impacts of climate change. First Nations respondents were even more likely to be struggling to pay for essentials, such as energy and other bills.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a frustration of renting, not being able to take greater control of power via rooftop solar. Renters need better visibility on the energy efficiencies of rental premises, and the same goes for small businesses, who are often also renting. They are incredibly frustrated. In particular, the government's legislation giving small businesses access to instant asset write-offs and energy incentives to decarbonise has stalled for months, and yet it is due to end—even though it has not even taken effect yet—at the end of this financial year. It's ridiculous, and I call on the government to urgently extend the program.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I echo the call of the member for Wentworth for the government to implement policies that incentivise landlords and provide rebates to low-income households to install rooftop solar PV and batteries. Australia is the continent with the most abundant solar and wind. We must make sure that all Australians can take advantage of the bountiful supply that we have. We need to go faster to tackle climate change and emissions reductions. We need to reduce emissions by a minimum of 75 per cent by 2035 to have any chance of keeping warming in check. We need an equitable, long-term approach. We can't leave behind huge sections of our community—in particular, renters and low-income households.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need measures to incentivise landlords, home builders and people in regional and rural communities to decarbonise. Decoupling energy from fossil fuels will deliver savings and provide Australians with energy independence and protection from inflationary pressures. This is a no-brainer. By helping households decarbonise, we can reduce the average power bill by some $1,100 to $1,800 a year with rooftop solar, by around $500 to $1,600 a year with more efficient electrical appliances and by even more with insulation and improved energy efficiencies, yet we hear nothing from the government on improved building standards or mandatory codes. Even the social housing and the HAFF bills were silent on ensuring the coupling of measures to ensure energy efficiency.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a cost-of-living issue, but it is a health issue ultimately, as we are witnessing more and more extreme weather events more and more frequently. We know heat will bring health risks, and that adds more pressure to the system. It is a no-brainer for the government, in this May budget, to increase its support for the Household Energy Upgrades Fund and deliver an electrification-of-households program, a people's power plan. We can be ambitious; the government needs to do things like interest-free loans, which can offer a low-cost way to encourage homeowners and landlords to immediately access the savings from rooftop solar and accelerate emissions reduction. We need the Small-scale Renewable Energy Scheme; it was slated to end in 2030 and it needs to be extended. It supports consumers directly to use renewable energy to lower their bills.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thirdly, it should pursue small-scale renewable energy and battery projects, currently specifically excluded from eligibility for support from the Capacity Investment Scheme. This should be looked at as well. We know that we need some 15 gigawatts of storage by 2030. This can be achieved by having 30 per cent of households which have solar taking up batteries as well. Where is the government plan to deliver that? We have success stories about this in Warringah, from Colormaker Industries to Free TV Australia, and we have Zero Emissions Sydney North and Solar Alliance all working hard to electrify our households and small businesses. The government absolutely must do more.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GEORGANAS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Adelaide</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:15</span>):  I thank the member for Wentworth for raising this very important issue. Like this side of the House and the government, she understands that climate change is real, that we need renewables and that time is running out. We know that the 10 years of inaction by the former government caused prices to go up. There was no investment in renewables. Of course, if you were an investor in renewables, why would you invest when the government at the time, the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government, was divided about whether climate change was real? That was one of the starting points. If you were an investor in renewables, why would you have invested over that period of 11 years when they were in government? Thank God the government has changed and real action is being taken to reduce emissions, to ensure that energy prices are cheaper and to ensure that we do everything we can to use those magnificent things of nature—wind, solar, the sun et cetera.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll read out an email I received last week from a constituent of mine called Paul, a resident of the Adelaide federal electorate. Paul said: 'The $125 quarter concession impact was astonishing. My last electricity bill was $52.69, an amazing 71 per cent less than I would otherwise have received and the lowest bill that I have ever received in my life. But it gets even better. When the PM initiated the energy cap negotiations, it stimulated my energy supplier to initiate a "free electricity for two hours a day" offer, which means an additional $45-plus per quarter credit to my bill. If included, then this amounts to a whopping 76 per cent saving to my electricity bill. Thank you, thank you, thank you.' Those were Paul's exact words and they speak volumes about the impact of the action that this Albanese Labor government is currently undertaking. The truth is that the government has been making some big moves in this area. Initiatives like the Household Energy Upgrades Fund, the solar bank scheme and funding for social housing are making a real difference, and they're making a real difference in my electorate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Paul wasn't just talking about numbers here; he was talking about the real impact that government action is having on his life. It's about putting money back in pockets of hardworking Australians, making a real difference in their daily lives and, at the same time, reducing emissions. Consider the impact of solar panels: if you've got solar panels on your roof, you're already saving between 39 and 57 per cent on your energy bills. That's up to $1,350 per year. And, if you add a battery to your set-up, those savings shoot up to over 100 per cent—more than $2,000 annually. But the whole country benefits from cheaper energy through renewables: we reduce our emissions, which is the No. 1 priority for all of us, and, at No. 2, we have more players in the market with renewables, which will eventually bring prices right down. The whole country benefits from cheaper energy. Rooftop solar is driving prices down for everyone by reducing demand on the grid and cutting the need for expensive fuel sources during the day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">However, some people think that it's a good idea to put the brakes on renewables and to look at something called 'nuclear' 15 to 20 years down the track. We don't have time for 20 years down the track, but some people think it's a good idea. It will leave us in the dark as old coal plants shut down and make energy prices more expensive. They've even voted against helping struggling households with their energy bills, as we saw when we moved our energy bill about 18 months ago.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's time to stop blocking progress and start supporting cleaner, cheaper energy for all, and that's why this government is investing in upgrading our grid and unlocking more reliable power sources. We're making sure that when the sun goes down you still have electricity, without breaking the bank. We're helping low-income families and renters get in on the solar action as well. With initiatives like the household energy upgrades and solar banks, our aim is simple: we want everyone, regardless of their circumstances, to reap the benefits of energy upgrades. Improving the energy efficiency of social housing means putting money back into pockets. It's about introducing better technology, efficient air conditioning, upgraded hot water systems, improved lighting, and double-glazed windows. After years and years of neglect it's time to act, and this Albanese Labor government is acting. <span style="font-style:italic;">(</span><span style="font-style:italic;">Time expired</span><span style="font-style:italic;">)</span></span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The motion that I move today notes that the Albanese government's economic management has, among other things, delivered the first budget surplus in 15 years, something the former Liberal and National government promised but never delivered, and we have done so at a time when we know that Australian families, Australian consumers and the Australian public are doing it tough. They are doing it tough with the cost-of-living issues that are impacting every family across the country, and that's why, with a budget surplus in our first budget, there's a level of trust among the community—certainly in my community of Lalor—in this government and its economic management. They have seen us not just deliver that surplus but also deliver back to Australians in our cost-of-living relief, though energy bill relief, cheaper medicines, cheaper child care, the strengthening of Medicare, higher income support payments and the biggest boost to rent assistance in 30 years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As well as that, we are delivering Labor's cost-of-living tax cuts, which are incredibly important. These tax cuts will make a real difference for 13.6 million taxpayers who'll receive a tax cut—2.9 million more than would have benefited from Scott Morrison's plan from five years ago. It means 11.5 million taxpayers, 84 per cent, will receive a bigger tax cut. It means that 5.8 million women—that's 90 per cent of women taxpayers—will now receive a bigger tax cut. Nurses, teachers and truckies are some of the most likely to benefit, with more than 95 per cent of those taxpayers getting a bigger tax cut. Parents, particularly women with young children, will be meaningfully supported to return to work under the government's changes, through increases to their take-home pay. Under the proposed changes, taxpayers earning less than $45,000 will now receive a tax cut. For a family on an average household income of around $130,000 a year, with one partner earning $80,000 and the other earning $50,000, their combined tax cut will be over $2,600—about $50 a week. That will help those families with the cost of living.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's changes deliver a better and more progressive tax system as well. The plan returns bracket creep for taxpayers and does more to reduce the impact on those most burdened by it. By dropping two tax rates and lifting two thresholds, we're giving everyone a tax cut, providing $359 billion in help with the cost of living and returning bracket creep where we can do the most work, in Middle Australia. As a result, the average taxpayer will pay $21,635 less of their income in tax over the next decade. And that's not all this government has done.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government has also got wages moving. We said we'd get wages moving and we have. Real wage growth is back, and ahead of schedule. The Albanese government wants people to earn more and keep more of what they earn. We've highlighted time and time again what that means for communities. In communities like mine, there are families right now who have benefitted from the 15 per cent pay rise for workers in aged care, and there are families who now look forward to a tax cut to go with that 15 per cent pay rise. So lifting wages, reducing taxes, earning more and keeping more of what you earn—that's what this government's economic management is delivering.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And we have done that on top of the individual things around electricity bill relief. We all remember, after we were first elected, coming back for that December sitting to have the opposition vote against the measures that were going to make a difference and see electricity prices rise less than they would have without that legislation. We've introduced cheaper child care, which affects thousands of families in my electorate and is making a difference. For those at home, it may not feel like all of these measures, one by one, are making the boldest difference. But, generally speaking, they are, across the board, reducing the cost of living or limiting the cost of living.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have more Medicare bulk-billing. We've got a Medicare urgent care clinic in my electorate that's seen thousands of patients since it opened its doors. We've boosted income support payments. The fee-free TAFE has made a huge difference to communities like mine.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As well as that, the government is still facing the inflation challenges. The primary focus of the Albanese government is making sure that we support families across the country in this cost-of-living crisis so that they can earn more and keep more of what they earn.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Sturt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:26</span>):  I rise to address this motion about the economic situation in Australia at the moment. I come at it from the perspective that anyone in this chamber would, which is what I'm hearing in my own community from the conversations I'm having with constituents. On Saturday, I was doorknocking in Royston Park, a suburb in my electorate, and earlier in the week I held a listening post at the Newton central supermarket and had some really good and diverse conversations with constituents about the challenges that they've got at the moment. A very consistent theme came up: people in different ways, for different reasons, are finding it really tough at the moment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was speaking to a constituent that bought a home a bit over three years ago and has just had her fixed loan roll off to a variable loan and has been hit with an enormous increase to her household mortgage because, of course, interest rates have gone up so dramatically in the last few years under this government. I spoke to a gentleman while doorknocking who has kids in their late 20s who he said have effectively given up the dream of being able to save up to buy a house. He's very worried about how he can support them to do what he was able to do decades earlier, which was, at the age that they're at, already be a homeowner and about how vitally important homeownership was to economic independence and economic security when he was in that stage of life that his kids are now in. I spoke to a lady who is making difficult decisions when she goes to the supermarket about things she used to buy that she's not buying anymore. She's purchasing frozen vegetables instead of fresh at times and different meat that's just what she can afford within the household budget. So it is tough. Those are just three examples of many that I'm hearing. I'd be very surprised if other members don't hear the same things from their constituents.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think what constituents are looking for from government is not for them to congratulate themselves on how things are going, because no-one out there is saying, 'My life is really good at the moment.' They're saying quite the opposite. It is folly for governments to spin these situations and try to pretend, as this motion indicates, that people should be grateful for what this government is doing for them. I'm not getting that feedback from anyone. I get a lot of different stories and a lot of anecdotes about how things are tough, and they stretch across various issues in the household budget and in people's economic circumstances. But not a single person is saying, 'I feel like this federal government is really looking after us and has the right priorities at the moment and is doing things that are making my life better.' Everyone's talking about electricity prices going up, grocery prices going up, mortgages going up and rents going up. They're finding it tough to make the household budget work as it has in the past and having to make really difficult decisions, like cancelling family holidays, because those sorts of things that people look forward to, that are discretionary, have to be sacrificed in this very difficult economic circumstance that families are finding themselves in.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I caution the government against congratulating themselves on the economic situation in this country right now, trying to convince Australians that they're doing something about cost-of-living pressures and thinking that the people of this country should be grateful and should be thanking the government for what they're doing, because not a single Australian, no-one in my electorate of Sturt, and I'm sure it's the same for most other members—their constituents are not saying, 'We really feel like the government's on our side, helping us and supporting us at the moment.' I'm getting the exact opposite feedback. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We don't need motions like this from the government, which is completely inaccurate and incorrect, to suggest that Australians are benefiting from any policy decisions of the government. We need decisions that will actually help Australians with the things that they're worried about, and that is the cost of living across a whole range of areas. This government has policy levers available to it that it's choosing not to pull. That means that they're not on the side of Australians; they don't have the right priorities. They should be condemned for that. We in the opposition will keep standing up for Australians that are raising with us these very serious and significant challenges that they're finding in meeting the household budget under this Labor government.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="295588" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr GARLAND</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Chisholm</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:31</span>):  I'm pleased to speak in support of this motion moved by the member for Lalor, and I thank the member for bringing it to this place. After almost a decade of economic mismanagement, our government is getting things back on track, delivering the first budget surplus in 15 years—something, of course, that the former government repeatedly promised to do and repeatedly failed to do. This is no small feat for our government. Our economic plan is all about easing inflation and easing the cost of living at the same time that we lay foundations for growth in our economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recent figures show that we have made welcome and encouraging progress in the fight against inflation. But, as the Treasurer has noted, this is not 'mission accomplished', given that we know how many people are still under pressure. There is still more to do. But our responsible approach has made room for critical investments that boost the capacity of our economy and lay stronger foundations for growth, including in energy, housing and skills. We're ambitious for our communities. We know that people are under pressure because of higher global inflation and higher interest rates, and the economy is slowing in expected ways. We cannot undo nearly a decade's worth of economic mismanagement in just over 18 months, but we are making welcome progress.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our entire approach to the economy and the budget is defined by responsible economic management. We said that we would get wages moving again, and we are. Real wages growth is back and ahead of schedule. We believe that hardworking Australians should earn more—and this is great for our local economies too; it's more money to spend in our communities. We want people to earn more and keep more of what they earn.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Additionally, we know that, from 1 July this year, every single Australian taxpayer will get a tax cut. That is 13.6 million people who will receive tax cuts, thanks to Labor's tax plan, with 11.5 million taxpayers receiving a bigger tax cut than under the old government's plan. In my electorate of Chisholm, 81,000 taxpayers will receive an average tax cut of $1,640. This will make a meaningful difference to families in my community, including the thousands of nurses, teachers and hospitality workers that call Chisholm home. We are supporting the aspirations of all Australians to build a good life for themselves and their families.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our cost-of-living tax cuts come on top of the tens of billions of dollars in cost-of-living relief already rolled out and rolling out, including electricity bill relief, cheaper child care and increased rent assistance. We've also invested in more Medicare bulk-billing and cheaper medicines. We've boosted income support payments and invested in fee-free TAFE training, and we're getting to work on building more affordable homes. Our government is also expanding paid parental leave and making sure that wages keep moving.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is of course in stark contrast to those opposite, who just say no to any idea and have no real policies of their own. We want Australians to earn more and keep more of what they earn, while the opposition wants Australians to work longer and for less. The Liberals said no to cheaper medicines and to energy bill relief, and now they're saying no to lower taxes for Middle Australia. When it comes to the cost of living, those opposite have no genuine plan and always say no. It is all negativity, with zero policies. As the Treasurer highlighted last week, since coming to government the average amount of money that we will bank as a nation will be much higher than under our predecessors. We are more responsible and we're making sure that we've got an eye to the future and to the economic foundations we know we need to build now for growth.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm proud to be part of a government that's not only supporting Australians where and when it can but also delivering good economic management that lays a solid foundation for the future. I'm so pleased that the member for Lalor has brought this matter to the House today, and I'm very pleased to have had the opportunity to support it.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BROADBENT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Monash</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:36</span>):  I don't mind if the government have programs and they say things before an election campaign about what they're going to do in regard to housing. But don't then tell me 100 times that you're going to reduce the cost of power—as the previous member just said, they have a power reduction program—by $275. You said that time after time after time, and people in my electorate listened to you, understood what you were saying and supported you. A whole four per cent of them decided to move towards the Labor Party and away from my position. People thought, 'I'm going to be $275 better off if I vote Labor.' What has happened? They haven't had a $275 reduction.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But then Labor said, 'Oh, no, we've got five years to do that.' The trouble is that the Prime Minister didn't say that during the election campaign. He didn't say, 'In five years time I'll give you a $275 cut.' He just said, 'I'll give you a $275 cut.' It's sort of a reversal of the 'Mediscare' campaign from the previous election. It's a promise to say, 'I'm going to give you this,' but then they don't give it to you. You can understand that people are under pressure, and all the previous speakers have recognised that people are under pressure from power prices and a lot of state government costs, like your water and your electricity. When has the federal government come along and said, 'Here's what we can do for you'? It hasn't happened.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What happens in your new housing program, whatever it's called, which we just debated in the House and went through—it's another first home buyer type scheme; oh, it's the Help to Buy program—when the market intervenes, people can't pay for some reason, their interest rates go too high and they're under pressure?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I went to get a punctured tyre repaired, and the guy repairing the tyre said, 'You're the politician, aren't you?' And I said yes, but I was trying to hide it, with the way I was dressed. He said, 'Do you know my mortgage has gone up 1,500 bucks?' This guy is running and is part owner of a very good tyre business. They've always looked after me very well in Pakenham and always been great. He said: 'It's 1,500 bucks, mate. That's what it's costing me over and above what I was paying.' He said, 'I have to find that money.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I recently had a very well-paid person come to me and say, 'Russell, you don't understand how high the mortgage is that we've got to pay.' Well, no, I don't understand how high his mortgage is, because when I took out the mortgage on the small farm that I'm on it was $30,000. Then, in the next episode, from others that I've heard about, their mortgages went to $60,000, then $80,000, then $150,000 and then $200,000. When I asked a young girl who worked with me for a while, Priscilla, what she'd borrowed to get into her unit in Parkdale, or wherever it was, she said $400,000. I was in shock. Now people are borrowing $1 million. For some of the people these days who have borrowed that sort of money, a tiny change in interest rates is catastrophic. And they all believed that interest rates wouldn't change for a long time. As we heard from the member who spoke before, people come up to you and say, 'I've just moved from a fixed loan to a variable loan, and the price has gone through the roof for me.' And this has happened to thousands of people across Australia. I learned very quickly that people are now relying not only on their income but also on their savings. They're using up their savings just to survive at the moment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Governments should be very aware of the electorate when people are under pressure, because they will have regard for everything you say, all the time, about what you're going to do. And if you don't do it beware, because the people will be coming for you.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="132880" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr MULINO</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fraser</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:41</span>):  This motion deals with the way in which some of the significant medium-term global economic challenges that have hit Australia are being dealt with. A couple of years ago, some major international ructions affected all of the major economies in the world. There was the post-COVID supply chain issues and the illegal invasion of Ukraine, and the impact they had on energy prices and food prices. All of these impacts led to a global surge in inflation, which Australia wasn't immune from. That led to a cost-of-living challenge, which affected the most vulnerable in our community. The government made clear from the start that, in dealing with that challenge, the most important thing for the living standards of our most vulnerable people is to deal with inflation. What I want to talk about is the fact that the best way to deal with inflation is for fiscal policy and monetary policy to work together. If that doesn't happen, you are not going to deal with the underlying economic challenge that is impacting on people's lives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have seen a series of interest rate increases, which was unfortunately a necessary part of dealing with this broader economic challenge. In conjunction with that, the government has put in place a number of targeted but responsible measures, which have provided assistance to the most vulnerable. There have been a number of components of that—rental assistance, cheaper energy bills, cheaper medicine and assistance for child care. In the labour market, there have been a series of very important measures, including the government supporting the case for an increase in the minimum wage, which I might add those opposite opposed, tooth and nail, both in the election campaign and since. The government has also supported a material increase in wages for people—mostly women—working in the aged-care sector, and we've strengthened workers' rights and workers' voices through a series of important industrial relations bills.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All of these measures have meant that people are taking home more and that people are getting direct assistance, but it's important to note that the way in which the government has provided that assistance has not added to inflationary pressures. This is something which has been confirmed by the Reserve Bank, by Treasury modelling and by all of the major economic commentators out there, including all of the chief economists at the big four banks, and on and on it goes. The government has provided assistance, as it should—and the people in my own community have been talking about the way they've been struggling—working hand in glove with the Reserve Bank.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we also find is that the government has adopted a responsible fiscal position on short-term fiscal uplift—in other words, the increase in revenues, compared to what was forecast, that arose on the government's balance sheet as a result of a stronger than expected labour market and stronger than expected revenue from resources, at least in the previous financial year. The government has banked the vast majority of that. In fact, it has banked far more of the cyclical uplift that the previous coalition government did. It has been managing finances in a way that is very responsible. It's doing it in a way that puts downward pressure on inflation but, at the same time, allows the government to provide targeted assistance to the most vulnerable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's the government's overall approach, and we see that inflation has in fact come down materially from a reading of around 8.4 per cent on a monthly basis some 14 months ago to a monthly reading of less than four and a quarterly reading of 4.1 per cent. So inflation has come down a long way. It's not mission accomplished, but it has come down materially. At the same time, while it's very unfortunate that unemployment has risen, it has risen less than had been forecast. So in terms of the narrow path that we're trying to walk to reduce inflation and to do so with the least possible disruption to people's purchasing power and to the labour market, we have managed to achieve that in a way that's better than what most had forecast would be possible 18 months ago. So the strategy the government is putting in place is a responsible strategy but also one with targeted assistance to those that need it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then of course there are the changes to the stage 3 tax cuts, which complement all those measures and do it in a way which improves bracket creep—and also labour supply, by around 930,000 hours per week. So this is a responsible and effective overarching economic strategy. The job is not done, but we are well on the way.</span>

They've distanced themselves from the realities of the Australian economy that surround them. They look out and see a world that isn't actually there; they don't see the real world, and that's how you get a motion like this—commending themselves on economic management. What they don't see is a world where grocery prices have gone through the roof—walking down those aisles at the grocery store, with mum and dad asking themselves, 'How much will it cost this time?' and knowing that the answer is always 'more'. They don't see the world where young Australians still want the great Australian dream of homeownership. They don't want government ownership of their homes; they want homeownership, and they can't afford it. Prices continue to go up, and there's their inability to save to meet the deposit demands, let alone to service growing payments.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They don't see a world where the rental market is so tight and expensive that it has absolutely crushed the ambitions of young Australians who are renting now but who want to be homeowners in the future. They don't see that. But they could, because the facts are out there. The facts are out there on Labor's economic management. Electricity costs are out of control; in some areas, electricity bills have risen by nearly $1,000. Western Sydney is hit particularly by that increase. And for a government that came in promising wage growth, real disposable income has fallen 7.5 per cent. People are working harder and getting less for it—what they can actually purchase is going backwards. Australians are now paying tax revenues that are 23 per cent higher; Australians are paying 23 per cent more tax to the government. That's money out of Australian pockets; working Australians are paying more and more tax. Prices on almost everything have increased by 9.8 per cent. They could see this; they could get outside the Canberra bubble, see the real world and see these price increases—they're out there. This is not economic management: interest payments on mortgages have almost tripled since Labor came to government. Think of those young families who have purchased the great Australian dream, who have got in on the property ladder but who are now seeing their interest repayments triple. Productivity has fallen 5.4 per cent, the biggest recorded fall since we started recording productivity. It's the biggest fall we've ever seen—and of course productivity is directly connected to real wages. If productivity goes backwards then real wages go backwards, and Labor have proven that point.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But Labor look outside all this; they look across all this and see economic management, and they come in here to boast about it. They're in the twilight zone; they're in a world of wonderous imagination but horrendous financial pressure. It must be an entertaining world to live in. But for the rest of Australia—those who aren't on the conga lines of staffers and union officials awaiting their appointment to the great Labor machine—who have to work for a living, sometimes outside air-conditioned offices—</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">As Labor approaches their third budget while they're still trying to look somewhere else for blame, they're poorly managing migration. Five-hundred thousand people came to Australia in 12 months—the greatest influx we've ever had—driving house prices and rents up at a time when we've got an all-time low in housing approvals. They've made energy market interventions that haven't worked. No-one has gotten their $275 reduction. Prices have gone up. And worse—these interventions have resulted in massive taxpayer payouts. Just to make things a little bit worse, they've introduced terrible IR legislation that has reduced labour market flexibility, will continue to reduce labour market flexibility and will push productivity further down, which is going to push down real wages. This is economic management, apparently.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just to top it off, I speak to the people of Groom in what I like to call Prado country. We've got our fantastic new ute tax. A Prado will go up $13,000. If you want to go with the Land Cruiser, it's $25,000. If you like the Ranger, as I do, it's $18,000 more. The tradies—the people doing the work, building this great country, out there sweating in the hot sun and paying their taxes—are going to be paying more. Worst of all, to wrap this up in a neat little bow, this government has introduced $209 billion of additional spending. At a time when the RBA is trying to take money out of the economy, they're pushing money back in.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lingiari</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:51</span>):  Just in continuation—organisations in our regions, and particularly in the bush, are the most important drivers of social cohesion and opportunity in the regions and in communities. It has been the modus operandi of coalition governments for a few decades now to try and bring in bureaucracy approved competitor entities from outside. Sometimes they claim not-for-profit NGOs, sometimes a favoured entrepreneur. That replacement entity gets the contract or contracts, and the local community organisation shrivels up. It is usually then that any governance problems which may have existed get worse.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm not suggesting there haven't been a few larger entities which have gotten themselves into difficulty without any outside pressure or assistance. But, when it happens, it isn't some phenomenon unique to Indigenous corporations. In the Northern Territory, there have been several organisations, such as NAAJA and the Northern Land Council, that need to look at why they are there—for the advancement and welfare of the people that they purport to represent. A failure to do this will be at their demise.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to calls for an audit, which were in the motion moved, I would like to suggest an alternative audit. The audit I would suggest would be put into practice and could be fostered and agreed to by a coalition government, especially when it comes to Indigenous affairs. There is a piece of legislation that could be extended to deal with some of these anomalies, and that is the PGPA Act. Under this act are the Public Governance, Performance and Accountability Rule 2014 and other federal legislative instruments that establish the requirements and procedures necessary to give effect to the governance, performance and accountability matters covered by the PGPA Act. In my opinion, and for what it is worth, it is time to transition all organisations that receive Commonwealth funding to be accountable under this legislation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The second thing they've called for is a royal commission into child sexual abuse in Indigenous communities. I am just as committed as every member of the federal parliament to ensuring that perpetrators are detected, prosecuted and punished and that victims are protected and supported. Just as importantly, the values and mindsets of cohorts within the community who can become potential offenders need to be challenged and changed so that future victims are protected. I think having a royal commission is just a strategy for delaying and not taking action.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The cashless debit card has been reinstated in vulnerable communities. I don't comment too much about communities outside of my backyard, so I'll let others speak in relation to places outside of the Northern Territory. But, in the NT, people have become income managed since the intervention. They are stuck with the BasicsCard. The cashless debit card is pretty much a nonissue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Summing up, I do want to acknowledge the important leadership and deep commitment shown by the Prime Minister, Minister Burney and Assistant Minister McCarthy to address across this country of ours, but particularly in the Northern Territory, the obvious inequity that has been happening across Indigenous affairs in this country for a long time. Maybe, when people stand up and point the finger at Labor, they should take note of the other fingers that are pointing at themselves. Many of them have just downplayed the severity of the issues facing the Northern Territory for a decade. I think that sometimes, particularly in relation to this issue, we've got to come to a place where both sides need to agree that we have, in this country, probably the biggest crisis facing Indigenous affairs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it is imperative for both sides to put aside the politics, the finger pointing and the bickering and to work together to try and get the best outcome. That's what my constituents say to me: 'Why can't you politicians in federal parliament sit down and just work through a process where we're going to get better outcomes on the ground in our communities?' This is true. Sometimes, we've just got to let go of our own ideology and the politics and look at what we need to do to try to get the best outcome, particularly if we're looking at generational change. In a lot of communities that I travel in, suicide rates are still too high. We need to start looking at that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, on that note, I just hope that we can close the gap.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PITT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hinkler</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:56</span>):  I, of course, move to support the motion by the member for Durack and, in particular, the acknowledgement that it was the Labor government that spent $450 million on a divisive Voice to Parliament, and, not only that, they removed the cashless debit card from trials around the country. I want to acknowledge the work of the members for Grey, Durack and O'Connor because they are the individuals who actually lived through the implementation, the rollout, the development and then the removal of the cashless debit card in their electorates—an actual element which works. It's a policy that works and a policy that was supported enormously by local communities. We saw the Labor government wanting to implement a voice to parliament across the country, and they're now, after the defeat of the referendum, talking about local voices, but they won't listen to the local voices on the cashless debit card. This is a policy which is difficult. It is tough, but it works.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We should look at the reasons we implemented it, particularly in my trial site area of the Hinkler electorate. We started that trial in January 2019. It ended in September 2022 after the Albanese government repealed the legislation. Eighty per cent of recipients' payments went on the card and 20 per cent into their bank account. The 80 per cent couldn't be used to buy alcohol, gamble or use illicit substances because recipients didn't have cash.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Here's one of the prime reasons we implemented it. In September 2017, when Hinkler was announced as a trial site, the statistics were very, very sobering. Of those who were under 30 on welfare at that time, 90 per cent had a parent who had been also on welfare in the last 15 years—the majority of which were on welfare for at least nine of the last 15 years. Without any intervention, it was projected that 50 per cent of those under 30 on welfare would still be on income support in 10 years time. They are the reasons that we support tough policies, like the cashless debit card—because we are failing the vulnerable in our community. We are failing them, and yet the Labor government has taken away something which works. They ran an enormous scare campaign, and I'll come to that in a moment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, in terms of support, we ran any number of consultations and discussions. It was even tested by the local newspaper with research and polling, and the lowest number I ever saw was 65 per cent support. In fact, it was as high as 70 per cent in some places. Rents were being paid. There were increases in the purchases of food and items for kids. Support organisations were saying that they were handing out less welfare support. These are the things that actually happened on the ground for real people with real kids in real communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We saw in March 2023 the Labor Party issue what they call their 'local services plan', and guess what it did? It verified the reasons the CDC was rolled out in the first place. There were five priorities. The first was data sharing. We would have done that, but the Queensland Labor state government wouldn't give us the data. Next were: collaboration; alcohol and drug use and mental health; family and domestic violence; and employment. In 2020 at the state election the then Palaszczuk government actually committed to building a rehab and detox facility in Bundaberg. Guess how much of that is built? A duck egg, none, zero—not delivered; construction still hasn't started.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are for doing things that matter. We are for moving with policies that will actually make a difference. We see that the Labor Party has now implemented what it calls 'voluntary income management', where 50 per cent of the payments go onto a card. And guess what? It's the same card, with the same provider, with the same technology, operated by the same financial institution—all of the issues that the Labor Party complained about when the coalition was rolling it out. It's the same. They haven't changed it. There was a scare campaign that age pensioners would be going onto the CDC. Well, from the most recent data, from 29 December 2023, in the Northern Territory, guess who's got age pensioners on the cashless debit card? The Labor Party. There are 18 of them. In fact, they've got 7,384 individuals in the Northern Territory on the CDC. But in my electorate, where we had some 6,000, making a real difference, the number is now 16. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've had a look at the complaints from the Labor Party right through the campaign and all the way through previous terms of government. They were all about how much this card cost per individual. Can you imagine the differential between 6,000 participants on the card and 16? It is enormous. It is absolutely outrageous that those opposite would run a campaign based on elements which they themselves then delivered. They have put age pensioners on the cashless debit card. They have used the same provider. They have used the same technology. The only difference is that there are now 7,000 individuals in the Northern Territory using the CDC. If the coalition are returned to government, we will reinstate the cashless debit card.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HVP" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PERRETT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moreton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:01</span>):  The member for Durack has said that the Voice to Parliament referendum was 'divisive', language that is parroted by all those on that side. They mean divisive in a pejorative sense, in a black-and-white sense, in a First Nations and non-First Nations sense. Obviously the nation divides every election day. We make a decision, we cast a ballot and then we unite. It's no big thing to actually make a decision, especially when it comes to changing the Constitution. An idea—taking something to the Australian people and saying, 'This is something you should consider'—should not be something that scares people. The fact that our birth document does not mention First Nations people is surely something all sensible people would want corrected. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the most divisive thing that I saw about this constitutionally entrenched and budgeted-for process was the misinformation peddled by the member for Durack and her colleagues—not all of her colleagues but some of her colleagues. For example, Senator Price from the Northern Territory, on referendum day, Saturday 14 October, was actually in my electorate of Moreton, on the south side of Brisbane. She was hard at it, spreading poisonous words and misinformation at some of my local booths, standing amongst some of the poorest people in Brisbane, before going off to party with a couple of millionaires that night—unbelievable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I think about the 'yes' campaign in Moreton, it makes me feel very, very proud, because people of all ages and political persuasions turned up in large numbers to take part in a grassroots, community based campaign, and none swanned in on jets from the Northern Territory; they were all locals. Most had never doorknocked before, and most were not political. They were nervous but passionate. It was their shared values that motivated them to doorknock and to talk to strangers about why they were voting yes, because they believed in constitutional recognition for our First Nations people and for the opportunities for change that a Voice to Parliament could provide—a simple advisory body that could help solve a wicked problem.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Obviously the people of Australia said, 'Not yet,' but we know that change is in the wind. This group of people in Moreton, like the broader 'yes' campaign, were peddling hope, a positive vision for a better future and the acknowledgement and honouring of the 65,000-year history of our First Nations peoples. There was no dog-whistle division in Moreton. The 'yes' campaign brought people of all descriptions together in a very positive environment. The Albanese government is now focused on our deep and unwavering commitment to working with our Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander community and taking action to address entrenched inequality. Surely that's something that we can all agree on?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the months since the referendum, the Minister for Indigenous Australians met with community members across the country, as well as the Indigenous affairs ministers from every state and territory. Indigenous Australians want action, not more reports and a punching-down by hypocritical, shortsighted politicians looking for cheap political points. They don't want another royal commission into child protection and nor do the 157 stakeholders working in the child protection sector. Instead, we listened to their recommendation for the appointment of an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children's commissioner to work on the scourge of child abuse and ensure that every child has the right to grow up safely and healthily. They don't want another audit on Indigenous affairs spending, especially when there have been more than 20 audits since 2014. The National Indigenous Australians Agency has already begun implementing all of the Auditor-General's recommendations to ensure strong governance and accountability in programs and services, and this will be backed up by a new integrity branch.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What Indigenous Australians want is action on health, jobs, education, housing and justice. The Albanese Labor government listens to First Nations communities. We are working and collaborating with them to design and implement the programs that they want and that will work. The remote jobs program is creating 3,000 jobs with proper wages and decent conditions over the next three years. We want to double the number of Indigenous rangers by up to 1,000 jobs by 2030. Our fee-free TAFE courses attracted over 14,000 First Nations students, opening up pathways for future employment, diverse opportunities and, importantly, purpose and wellbeing. And $100 million is been invested in urgent work on new and existing housing and essential infrastructure in the Northern Territory homelands. Obviously, we must always put First Nations leaders at the centre of all such decisions. Under the Albanese Labor government, First Nations people will go forward.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="198084" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr RICK WILSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">O'Connor</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:06</span>):  I rise today to support my very dear and valued colleague the member for Durack on the motion which she has moved in this place predominantly addressing some of the issues around closing the gap. Those of us who represent electorates that have large populations of very remote Indigenous communities, where I think everyone in this place would agree the level of disadvantage is completely and utterly unacceptable and third-world in its nature, just want to see the improvements that we need to make. Many things have been tried from both sides of politics in, I believe, good faith in all instances. There is no doubt that people in this place, on all sides and from all parties, want to see major improvements made.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Having said that, I've seen lots of these programs that have been rolled out in my electorate fail quite dismally, to be quite honest, and fail the people who deserve help the most. As I say, that is those people living in my very remote communities such as Warburton, Warakurna, Laverton and Leonora. These are places not known to many Australians, but certainly to the people living live in those communities it is their land, it is their home and it is their culture and lifestyle. We need to support them and provide them with the amenities that we all enjoy in broader society while enabling them to live in their home territories and their homelands and to live their traditional lifestyles.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are programs that we have tried. There has been a multitude of them. In the town of Leonora we discovered that there were 53 separate programs targeted at children. In Leonora around 800 people live in the township. There would be maybe 100 children in the town. So we've got one program specifically targeted at children for every two children. We've never been able to identify the amount of actual expenditure on those programs, but I would say that the amount of money per child being spent in the town of Leonora would be eye-watering. So, while we've seen many programs, we have seen many that haven't necessarily been particularly successful.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Children in the town of Leonora are still not attending school in the numbers needed for them to achieve and move on. That's not to say there aren't some success stories. There are some wonderful children in Leonora. When I was in Leonora recently with Senator Kerrynne Liddle, I met with a young Indigenous girl who was off to Murdoch University. She studied years 11 and 12 via SIDE learning, which is remote learning. There is no year 11 or 12 at the Leonora District High School. So there was this beautiful young girl, with all those hopes and fears and nerves about moving to the big smoke and going to university, and I wished her the very best of luck. That was a success story. But, more broadly, we are seeing an abject failure in policy in this space. That is why I support Senator Jacinta Nampijinpa Price's call for a royal commission into these programs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to know what is working and what is not working. The previous speaker, the member for Moreton, said, 'Oh, we just need to ask the people that are delivering those programs.' Well, quite frankly, they are the last people we need to be asking. Of course, they have a vested interest in talking up their book; they have a vested interest in telling the government that the millions and millions, in fact, billions of dollars being invested in this space are being well spent and achieving the desired result. Well, patently, they're not achieving the desired result. Those people who live, work and travel in my electorate and who see those remote communities firsthand would be able to tell you that those programs—I think it's up to $30 billion worth—are failing dismally. We need to look closely at how these programs are being rolled out, why they are succeeding in the odd cases they are succeeding and why they are failing in the many cases they are failing.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GOSLING</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Solomon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:11</span>):  Last year, the government delivered on its election commitment to put the Voice to Parliament to a referendum and to put it to the Australian electorate. While it may not have been the outcome that many in our country had hoped for, we respect the decision that was made by the Australian people. I certainly do. This motion proves, though, that the only people still politicising the results of that referendum are those opposite. They accuse the federal government of having no plan B for Indigenous affairs. I reject that really weird assertion, given that for 10 years they had no plan A, B, C or D—no plans at all. When they did have a plan, it was for an intervention. I worked as part of that intervention. There was very minimal benefit to that enormous expense, but it also came at the expense of the disempowerment of a whole generation of First Nations people in the Northern Territory; that's the reality. What those opposite love to do is paint those out there in First Nations communities with the same brush, and that did a lot of damage.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All we hear is relentless negativity from those opposite, for opposition's sake. Opposition raised to a performative art form, dividing Australians with every opportunity they get. Those opposite's big vision for Australia, particularly when it comes to First Nations people, is to have a royal commission. They had a royal commission into youth justice that came out of the Don Dale Detention Centre in the Northern Territory and then didn't fund a dollar of putting the recommendations in. If those opposite got back onto the Treasury benches, we wouldn't see anything happening at all. I agree with those who say that we need to talk to the experts. Again, those opposite aren't that keen on talking to the experts, but they love fanning fears of woke corporations like the big two, particularly the big, bad Woolies that decided not to sell a particular type of flip-flop. So they thought, 'Let's tell everyone to ban that organisation.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Meanwhile, we're looking into both of the big two and getting the ACCC to do an inquiry into them. We're not so worried about flip-flops and the culture wars. We want to see the big two stop ripping off Australians. We all know the cost of living is expensive. But, again, after 10 years of those opposite doing next to nothing and getting us in the situation we're in, we find ourselves having to act on a whole range of issues. So I reject that we have no plan B—especially from those opposite.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is an entrenched inequality in this country. There's entrenched poverty in a lot of communities. We have been acting since the referendum, and any fair-minded person, any person looking at the state of affairs in Australia, would see that the Minister for Indigenous Australians has been out consulting, as have Senator McCarthy and Marion Scrymgour, my colleagues in the Northern Territory. They've been out there all across Australia and, in Marion's case, all across the Territory. The priorities are clear: health, jobs, education, housing and justice.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're not just listening to them; we're acting on their advice. The new Remote Jobs and Economic Development Program will change lives in remote communities. After a decade of those opposite and their failed CDP programs that did next to nothing to lift people up in those communities, we want real jobs out in those communities, and it'll be a game changer. We're also investing $4 billion in housing in remote communities. Again, not enough was done by those opposite over 10 years. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's what real plans mean. You fund them. You fund the initiatives in housing, education and health that will improve lives, and you make real jobs—real jobs like the ones we're going to see First Nations Territorians working in in the Northern Territory. That's what leadership is.</span>

Last year the Labor government devoted their time and energy to championing the Prime Minister's divisive Voice to Parliament proposal. They told us that Indigenous Australians needed our help and that the divisive Voice was the only way to close the gap and to improve the lives of Indigenous Australians. Yet the Voice was defeated soundly at the ballot box by everyday Australians who did not want to be divided by race. It cost Australians $450 million, and, even if it had been successful, it would not have achieved anything to close the gap in this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since that point, despite being in government, Labor have offered no alternative solutions to the problems plaguing Indigenous Australians. In the months since the Voice, they have proposed no new legislation for issues specific to Indigenous Australians. As is so often evident with this government, it had no plan B. Labor had no practical solutions, despite the coalition proposing multiple. When Senator Jacinta Nampijinpa Price and Senator Liddle tried to push for a committee inquiry and audit into spending and accountability in Indigenous communities and land councils, those calls were rejected by the government. The government could not even look into whether any money is being wasted, and of course we know that millions of dollars are being wasted across this country. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When the opposition leader called for a royal commission into child sex abuse in Indigenous communities, the Labor government ignored these calls. Programs which were working in vulnerable communities, such as the cashless debit card, have been scrapped, and, when the plight of these communities is raised with the government, they tie themselves in knots to explain why these communities are experiencing increases in violence. It's clear that the Labor government has no plan for Indigenous Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last month, we again sat in this House as the Prime Minister spoke on the annual <span style="font-style:italic;">Closing the </span><span style="font-style:italic;">gap</span> report. He acknowledged that not enough is being done to change the confronting statistics and improve the lives of Indigenous Australians. But, yet again, Labor offered no real solutions. The government's new remote jobs program has no modelling or proper planning. Aboriginal justice organisations like the North Australian Aboriginal Justice Agency are in turmoil, and the problems of crime, domestic violence and alcohol and drug abuse continue to grow every single day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's clear that there is more work to be done in order to close the gap in my electorate and improve the living conditions for Indigenous communities in Bowman. I've spoken in this House before about how, just 38 kilometres from Brisbane's city centre, on North Stradbroke Island, many Indigenous Australians live in near Third World conditions. Many of these areas predate European arrival as sites of Indigenous habitation, yet the current residents have no official tenure over the land they occupy. In the settlements near Amity Point, Myora reserve, One Mile and Two Mile, Australians are living in informal settlements with no established roads, mains electricity, running water or sewerage. Some of the dwellings are well maintained and built, but others are often made up of scrap materials or extended from mobile homes and are usually powered by generators.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In One Mile, one council-supplied skip bin is provided for the weekly waste of over 60 people who reside there. Some of these encampments are on unallocated state land, but most are on land subject to native title. These homes cannot be formally sold, leased, secured or insured. I worry for the welfare of my constituents living in these encampments. I worry for the severe bushfire risk that they face. I worry about the lack of security, both financial and physical, that these properties provide their owners. And, with the complete lack of housing options within North Stradbroke Island, I worry that this situation will only get worse.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Indigenous elders on the island are looking to solve some of the problems in this area, and I've met with them regarding their Aboriginal rights of residence program, which could help these communities invest in essential infrastructure and enable true ownership of their homes. They are proposing practical action—the sort of action the federal government could have supported, if it hadn't wasted $450 million on a failed referendum. The Voice would not have helped the people of One Mile or these other settlements, and a lot of the people living within those communities rejected the proposal at the ballot box.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians deserve a government who brings practical solutions to the table to fix the issues plaguing Indigenous Australian communities. I call on the government to take practical action to enable and support communities across the country to deliver real solutions on the ground.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is Endometriosis Awareness Month, and I want to formally thank the member for Bendigo for bringing this motion to the House to give us an opportunity to highlight not just the issues but also some of the history around this House's approach to endometriosis and to go through, in some detail, the response from the Albanese Labor government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me first pay tribute to a former member for Canberra Gai Brodtmann and the work that she did—often in partnership with the member for Maranoa, who was representing the opposition—to raise awareness in this federal parliament about the impact of endometriosis. Now, thanks to their work, we all know that it takes a huge toll in terms of not just the mental and physical health but also the quality of life for women who suffer from endometriosis. It is a highly individualised disease, and the symptoms and impacts range significantly from person to person. But it's estimated that endometriosis affects at least one in nine Australian women and has an extensive, devastating impact on the daily lives of sufferers, with people experiencing an unacceptable average wait of seven years before diagnosis. Their pain can be similarly complex and debilitating. Research has also shown that one in two Australian women experience pelvic pain and that half of those women do not discuss their symptoms with their doctor, despite significant impacts on work or study. I have been in this place for 10 years, and I'm finally a member of a government that has not just a commitment to gender equity but also a laserlike focus on gender equity and gender data in our health system.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to mention the national Women's Health Summit that occurred last week, on 14 March, led by the Assistant Minister for Health and Aged Care, the member for Cooper, Ged Kearney. The national Women's Health Summit came about because there was an advisory council on women's health to raise issues. It wasn't just about endometriosis but about the way women are experiencing our health system and the sector so we can get clearer data about the way our health system is responding to women's health issues. Endometriosis is like a microcosm of that; as this motion says, women are going for seven years before diagnosis. I know we've heard these stories time and time again in this place, but the fact of the matter is that waiting seven years for that diagnosis can mean that women have missed a significant amount of work or have given up employment because of the guilt they feel about not being able to go to work every day, not knowing when it's going to strike or when the pain is going to be so bad that they can't present for work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So this is incredibly important and the government's response to this is incredibly important. As the motion says, it:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… acknowledges that the Government is addressing endometriosis at a national level with a significant $58.3 million package for endometriosis and pelvic pain announced in the 2022-23 budget, including:</span>
              </p>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The importance of these clinics is quite simple. They bring into an existing practice considerable expertise in this specific area. Rather than women going to their GP or hunting around the country for a GP that understands their condition, they can now identify a clinic to attend. Even with only 22 around the country, that's 22 more than there were when we took office. Women know there's a clinic where the expertise will be available to them. They can walk in, as a patient, and know that they're going to talk to somebody who's informed, who has been involved in the research and who has the practice capacity to diagnose them and ensure that they're getting the support they need. We've also given access to new Medicare funded MRI scans to assist investigations for infertility for those with severe endometriosis. And we're developing an endometriosis management plan and other measures to better support those affected with endometriosis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to congratulate the many endometriosis patients, their families, organisations and health sector leaders for their continued advocacy on endometriosis awareness and education. I say to women in my electorate—young or middle aged—that it's time to take this disease seriously. Get yourselves to the clinics in Melbourne and make sure that you're getting a diagnosis and your treatment.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs McINTOSH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lindsay</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:27</span>):  The personal stories of endometriosis have helped this place get a better understanding of it and to really fight for more funding. Those stories go from the pain which impacts people's lives, both personally and in their working lives—that feeling of just needing to suffer through it—to fertility issues and, in the case of some, life-threatening issues. I'd like to acknowledge the member for Forrest for bringing this and her own personal experiences to this place so that we can have a greater understanding through the work she has done through her own family's experiences. This place is all the better for the advocacy of people like the member for Forrest and also the former member for Boothby and others. They have not stood back quietly, even though this has been a quiet issue traditionally. It has been very much front and centre in this place. I want to thank the member for Bendigo as well for leading the Parliamentary Friends of Endometriosis Awareness along with the member for Forrest.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One in nine women lives with endometriosis. It often begins to affect young women in their teenage years and the condition impacts around 200 million women worldwide. Approximately half of endometriosis cases will be challenged with fertility issues before a formal diagnosis is made. And, as has been said already, it can take around seven years for a diagnosis—and all the while, the woman is in pain. Many young women don't understand that the extreme pain is not normal and that they should seek help. Unfortunately, the direct causes of endometriosis are still not known and, whilst we work towards further understanding endo—particularly the cause, treatment and a cure—awareness is key. It isn't an issue that should be kept in the shadows at all, and we need to keep having those conversations. Education is an important piece in the health space. Providing talks and information to young women about looking out for signs and speaking with a GP is critical to ensuring that they get help early on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, personal experiences are key to understanding the impact it has on so many women's lives, both here in Australia and around the world. It is a debilitating condition, and there are much-needed advancements in the medical industry that need to take place to ensure diagnosis and adequate support is provided to all women with endometriosis. The coalition is pleased to see the government commit to funding our party's policy package of $58 million for endo and pelvic pain. However, we are concerned that the government's approach is only providing a limited boost to the current existing services. Investment is vital for women's health across the country. There are so many women, particularly in our outer urban areas, and in regional and remote areas, who are impacted by geography, unable to afford treatment and continue to suffer. There are so many out-of-pocket costs associated with endometriosis for women, and this is before they are even diagnosed. Procedures for diagnosis, check-ups and treatment can be invasive for many women. The coalition's commitment was the largest investment in endometriosis treatment and research in Australia and, once again, I'd like to commend the member for Forrest for the work she did in ensuring this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Furthermore, the former coalition government invested a record $353.9 million in the 2021-22 budget to support women's health. This included funding for research to find a cure for endometriosis and to support women experiencing this often hereditary disease. Specialised women's pain clinics, which are being built in every state and territory, were introduced by the coalition in 2022. Women's pain clinics have experts, which are extremely important for women suffering this condition.</span>

Your experience has been heard and we are grateful for it. We are working on ensuring a better future for young women who will be diagnosed with endometriosis in the years to come.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macquarie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:45</span>):  I asked my daughter if she had any words she'd like me to share with the parliament today when I spoke about endometriosis. She texted me back this morning and said: 'Endometriosis is in the too-hard basket for most doctors. Not once has a doctor explained the state of my body in such a way that I could explain it back to you. I don't know how damaged I am, I just quietly live with pain. Often, it's been the discussions with my female friends where I've learned the most about my diagnosis. We sit together and compare the breadcrumbs of advice and information we've each received from our doctors. We compare surgeries and pain remedies, but even between us it's frowned upon to talk about the pain too much. We all have the pain, but how sad is that?' That really does sum up what women across my community have told me about their experiences of living with endometriosis and pelvic pain. As we mark Endometriosis Awareness Month, I want to say thank you to the sufferers, their families and the advocates who have not stopped pushing for greater support, awareness, education and treatment about endo.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Endo is a progressive chronic condition that starts at puberty and can continue beyond menopause. On average, it takes seven years to be diagnosed and treated for endometriosis. Women are told that heavy periods are normal and that the extreme pain they are enduring is just part of being a woman. This process has left many distressed, frustrated and, sadly, has caused some women to lose trust in our healthcare system. Research has also shown that one in nine Australian women suffer endo, while one in two experience pelvic pain and that half of those women don't discuss the symptoms with a doctor. That's why I'm proud to be part of a government that's taking action so that endometriosis sufferers don't have to tough it out alone.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the start of this month, I welcomed the Assistant Minister for Health and Aged Care, Ged Kearney, to the Blue Mountains to mark International Women's Day with a health forum. We put gender bias in our healthcare system under the microscope. We were joined by women of all ages from across the electorate, including the Blue Mountains Women's Health &amp; Resource Centre, to hear firsthand from women about their experiences accessing the support that they need for endo and many other conditions. I'm thankful to the many women who took the time to share their deeply personal stories, including on the debilitating and often silent impact of endometriosis. I know that being part of this government means we'll continue to work towards ensuring practical steps to combat medical misogyny and to better support women through their journey to diagnosis and treatment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to battling endo, in its last budget the Albanese government included a $58.3 million package which covered a Medicare MRI item for investigating infertility related to endometriosis, the development of an endometriosis management plan and the establishment of 22 dedicated endometriosis and pelvic pain clinics across the country. I'm very pleased that we now have one of these officially open in Western Sydney. It opened just three weeks ago at the Rouse Hill Town Medical &amp; Dental Centre. Last week, I caught up with Simon Taylor-Cross and Dr Sneha Wadhwani, who is the Evoca Women's Health clinical director at Rouse Hill, to talk more about the clinic and what they've seen in the first few weeks of operation. While the clinic is in its early days, they've welcomed women from right across Western Sydney, including from the hills of the Hawkesbury. They've all gone there to meet with a team of people with expertise and knowledge. They're seeing women at different stages of their journey, with some in their early teens through to women in their mid-50s. Some are women who've had disappointing medical experiences previously and some have had surgery, while for others it has been their first serious discussion about endo. I'm so grateful that they will get a good start to that journey.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What's key at these clinics is the multidisciplinary approach, with nurse practitioners, GPs specialising in endo and pelvic pain, physios and other allied health professionals all geared to a holistic response. I'm sure for many women this will have been the first time in their lives that someone has listened to them explain their experience with debilitating pain from endo and believed them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was heartening to hear the clinic's unwavering commitment to delivering sensitive, understanding and transparent care for patients from the beginning, with every single staff member having had specialist training by the Pelvic Pain Foundation Australia. I hope this will be a place where women get the best experience in this terrible condition.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to acknowledge the suffering, crippling pain and impacts on the lives of the one in nine women—recent research shows it could be as low as one in seven women, so the prevalence is increasing—that advocates are now saying are suffering from endometriosis. I understand that the rate of hospitalisation has doubled amongst women aged 20 to 24 in the last decade. As we know, it is a progressive and chronic condition for which there is currently no cure.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to acknowledge my colleagues the member for Boothby and the member for Canberra, who worked closely with the coalition government to develop and introduce the first ever National Action Plan For Endometriosis, with record funding directed to improve diagnosis and primary care support to help more women find appropriate care and better manage the impact of endo on their lives, on their families, and on their social, work and study lives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In that 2022-23 budget, the coalition announced funding for 22 new specialised endo and pelvic pain clinics in every state and territory. This commitment was the largest ever investment in endometriosis treatment and research in Australia. I'm pleased that the Labor government has continued with this policy and has introduced the pelvic pain clinics, but you can understand that I'm desperately disappointed and frustrated and hurt for the women in my electorate that there is not one in the south-west of WA, one of the fastest-growing regions in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've previously shared my daughter's very personal endo experience, and I'm constantly approached by women who are doing their best to live with endo every day. I have the greatest respect for the courage and the determination of the women who literally live and work with endo every single day, with the excruciating pain—with the lower back and abdominal pain, the exhaustion, the bloating and the nausea, and, far too often, the fertility problems.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently, I heard from an amazing young woman, Brooke Gibson, who lives in Busselton. She has overcome so much in her endo journey but has refused to let the debilitating effects stop her from being a proud member of the Souwest Jets team, playing in Western Australia's netball league. She's also studying to become an occupational therapist. But she's grappled with endometriosis. It took her many years to receive a definite diagnosis. Unfortunately, this is not uncommon. It's often seven, 10 or more years, during which time the damage caused is well advanced and sometimes irreversible when the actual diagnosis is made. Brooke says her greatest struggle was with the health professionals who simply did not understand endo or had not been educated to diagnose endo.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my first speech in the parliament on endo, I asked every GP and health professional to please take these young women seriously. I know it can be difficult to diagnose, but, for goodness sake, I asked them, 'Can you please take these young women seriously or send them to an experienced gynaecologist who actually specialises in endometriosis?' Brooke is just one of the young women who would have benefited from a dedicated pelvic pain clinic in the south-west of WA. There is absolutely no doubt that the struggle to access or receive accessible treatment and care is much more challenging and often impossible in regional and remote parts of Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I just want to give a special shout-out to every young woman with endometriosis and mature-age woman who has realised later in life that she has endometriosis. The clinics themselves need to really be able to deliver. I want to see much more pelvic pain education in schools so that our young women know what is not normal and when to seek and get the help that they need early in their lives so that they don't have to suffer in the way that so many others before them and right now are suffering.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, our regional Australians, our women in regional and remote parts of Australia, are already facing additional and significant challenges in accessing medical and health services and support. It is no different with endometriosis. In fact, it's far worse. So these areas actually should be prioritised. They don't have all of the services that are often available in cities and outer-metro areas. They are much more isolated. So I'm going to ask the government to, please, prioritise those regions outside of Sydney for pelvic pain clinics.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Endometriosis is defined as endometrial glands and stroma that occur outside the uterine cavity. These endometrial lesions are typically located within the pelvis but can also occur in other parts of the body. They can occur in places like the bowel, the diaphragm and the pleural cavity, which is the bit that lines the lungs. They can cause symptoms that range quite significantly and can be very, very severe and debilitating for women who are suffering from endometriosis.</span>

                  </a>  As I was saying, endometriosis has a peak prevalence among those aged 25 to 35. However, it has been reported clinically in premenarchal girls and also in postmenopausal females. Really, this is a disease which affects women right across the lifespan—especially with some of those other symptoms I was talking about.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Some of the common symptoms of endometriosis that have been reported include things like: chronic abdominal and pelvic pain; bloating and pressure; severe dysmenorrhoea and dyspareunia; heavy menstrual bleeding; and infertility. These are just some of them, but there are additional symptoms if the endometrial lesions affect areas outside the pelvis. If they're affecting the bowel then there is bowel and bladder dysfunction—pain, urgency and frequency in urination; abnormal uterine bleeding; lower back pain; and chronic fatigue, just to name a few. The constellation of symptoms that can occur with endometriosis is vast and affects every patient differently.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll just go through some of those. Dyspareunia can suggest the presence of deep endometrial lesions or peritoneal lesions. We think of the urinary symptoms that I was just describing. That can suggest bladder endometriosis. Diarrhoea, constipation and abdominal cramping can suggest bowel lesions. Abdominal pain can result from endometrial lesions in one of the less common sites, the abdominal wall. These are some of the rarer ones. The endometrial lesions can actually affect the thorax or chest cavity, causing things like recurrent chest pain, haemoptysis or the coughing up of blood and also pneumothorax, in which the lung can collapse and cause significant respiratory distress in patients. This isn't a disease that affects one part of the body; it can affect multiple parts of the body, and that's why early diagnosis and management of this condition is absolutely vital so that women are able to live healthy and productive lives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Going into general principles of the treatment and management, that can include things that maximise medical treatment but also minimise the need for recurrent surgical intervention. Each treatment plan definitely needs to take into account the clinical presentation and severity of symptoms of all patients.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hughes</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:47</span>):  I rise to speak on this motion on endometriosis and thank the honourable members for Bendigo and Lalor for bringing this motion before the House. I also thank the member for Robertson, who has spoken so well on the medical issues around endometriosis, and the member for Forrest, who has been a co-chair of the Parliamentary Friends of Endometriosis Awareness for many years, as well as all the other members who have spoken and will be speaking on this important issue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a matter of profound importance to women's health and wellbeing. It's a condition where tissue similar to the endometrium, or lining of the uterus, grows outside of the uterus. It's often under-recognised and not diagnosed. It's a chronic condition that affects a staggering one in nine women in Australia and approximately 200 million women worldwide. The symptoms often emerge during teenage years. A laparoscopy is the only way to confirm that endometrial tissue is present.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yet, despite its prevalence, the causes of endometriosis remain elusive, and the journey to diagnosis is far too often fraught with delays, averaging around seven years. Endometriosis is not just about menstrual pain; it's about a pervasive, debilitating condition that can severely impact a woman's life. Half of those living with endometriosis will also have fertility challenges before a diagnosis is made. It has been described as pelvic cramps akin to labour pains—throbbing, gnawing and dragging pain, often extending down into the legs. Its toll extends beyond physical suffering to financial burden, with an annual cost to Australian society of around $9.7 billion per year, primarily attributed to lost productivity, as well as $2.5 billion in direct healthcare costs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recognising the gravity of this issue, the coalition has been at the forefront, when in government, of addressing endometriosis. In 2018, it launched the National Action Plan for Endometriosis, which provided a crucial blueprint for action. We have supported and welcomed the decisions of the Albanese government to uphold the coalition government's former budget measures, including$16.4 million for the establishment of endometrial and pelvic pain GP clinics in primary care settings throughout the country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also welcome the government's decision to maintain the former coalition government's commitment to invest $25 million in a new MBS item for pelvic MRI scans. We know this is such an important issue and such an important investment for women across the country who need better access to this critical support. Access to resources and informed healthcare choices are paramount for women battling endometriosis. We must equip both patients and healthcare providers with the necessary tools and guidance to navigate this complex condition effectively. In particular, more work needs to be done—particularly with the education of GPs. As we observe Endometriosis Awareness Month this March, let us recognise the pivotal role played by organisations like Endometriosis Australia. Its tireless efforts in research, advocacy and support are invaluable in easing the burden carried by those enduring the challenge of endometriosis, and I note that it recently launched an excellent podcast called <span style="font-style:italic;">L</span><span style="font-style:italic;">iving with Endo</span>.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, let it be known that the coalition remains steadfast in its commitment to improving the lives of Australian women and girls affected by endometriosis. We will do this in a bipartisan way; health should be way above politics. Together, let us continue to raise awareness, drive research and provide unwavering support to alleviate the burden of this debilitating condition. I take this opportunity to acknowledge particularly the tenacity and courage of Australian girls and women suffering and living with endometriosis every day. My sister Jacqui and my friend Jess are still playing sport, working, studying, caring for children and caring for parents. I say to them that we'll continue to approach this debilitating medical condition in a bipartisan way to bring about better treatments and, hopefully—finally—a cure. Thank you.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">For centuries, women around the world have suffered from severe and debilitating pelvic pain month after month, year after year, often being misdiagnosed, ignored, or indeed not believed at all. They've been told, 'It's all in your head,' or, 'It's just part of being a woman,' or, 'It's just the family curse.' They have suffered in silence as a result. Most severe pelvic pain is endometriosis. It isn't just bad period pain, but too often it's been dismissed as such. Endometriosis is a debilitating disease where tissue lining grows outside the womb and can grow into other parts of the body, including bowel and bladder. It has even been found in the skin, joints, lungs and brain. It can cause unbearable pain and problems with a woman's fertility. Many women experience heavy bleeding, pain with bowel motions, painful intercourse, nausea and vomiting. And it affects women in all aspects of life, including schooling, work, sport, relationships and mental health.</span>

                  </a>  It is indiscriminate and it affects at least one in nine women of all ages and races and every socioeconomic status. There is no known cause, no cure and no preventive medicine, and the disease can take, on average, seven years to be diagnosed. That's a very long time for a woman to be in pain, without a diagnosis and accurate treatment. Until recently, there was very little understanding of endometriosis or pelvic pain in the medical community. In 2021-22, there were 40,500 endometriosis related hospitalisations in Australia, 82 per cent of which were women aged between 15 and 44. That's 18 out of every 1,000 women in this age group being hospitalised for endometriosis or related conditions.</span>

We are taking practical steps to improve diagnosis and treatment, and in the last budget we included a $58.3 million package for endometriosis and pelvic pain. We're supporting endometriosis research, creating awareness in the community, supporting medical professionals with best-practice guidelines and information for treating patients, and developing an endometriosis management plan that can be tailored to individual experiences. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Significantly, as committed, the government has now completed the rollout of 22 dedicated endometriosis and pelvic pain clinics across Australia, where women are listened to, believed and holistically supported in their journey to be pain free. There are now clinics in every state and territory that are supported by specialised GPs and professionals with experience in women's health and endometriosis. In my electorate of Newcastle, there is a demand for specialised endometriosis and pelvic pain services. I'm pleased that, through the funding this government has provided, we are working closely with our local public primary health network to support doctors in best-practice diagnostics, care and treatment and to better inform the community of this serious issue.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I rise today to draw attention to the rapidly expanding illicit tobacco trade within Australia. I think most of the public would not be aware of its far-reaching impacts. he illicit tobacco trade within Australia is a multibillion-dollar—that's with a 'b'—illegal industry. In my view, and in the view of many others, we need to do much more to address this very serious issue. We have various agencies—Commonwealth and state—that have committed significant resources over the years to try and deal with the issue, with varying degrees of specific success but very little discernible impact on market supply.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But I would like to recognise those agencies, both federal and state law enforcement agencies, and, having done the work in the past—and my colleague from Wide Bay, who's next to me, has as well—I appreciate the difficulties that law enforcement agencies face. Despite the establishment of the Illicit Tobacco Taskforce by the coalition back in 2018, efforts have been compromised by the inability to disrupt the supply chain. It's extremely difficult, and unfortunately, when people think of illicit tobacco, they don't put it in the same terms as, say, cocaine or ice. It therefore doesn't get the attention that is needed to address this multibillion-dollar illicit industry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unlike other illicit substances, this particular criminal commodity can actually be measured against the government purse. In 2022, a report estimated that 23.5 per cent of all tobacco consumption in Australia—almost a quarter of all tobacco consumption—was illicit, resulting in a staggering $4.2 billion tax loss to the Commonwealth. In addition to the lost government revenue, we've seen direct negative impacts on legal tobacco retailers in general stores. I've spoken to numerous owners of legal tobacco shops. They are losing hundreds of thousands of dollars a month because of this illegal tobacco industry. These are people who pay tax and who employ people in our communities—legitimately and legally.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the same time, whilst these legitimate industries have lost over $300 million in retail over the last two years, the fact that we're not seeing seizures on the border is contributing to this illicit tobacco industry. In the first six months of 2023, tobacco sales declined an additional 10 per cent. I'd love to say that's because people are giving up smoking, but the fact is that the 10 per cent relates to illicit tobacco.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another very serious consequence of the illicit tobacco industry is organised crime syndicates using the illicit tobacco industry to fund more serious crimes, such as cocaine, ice and human trafficking. What we've seen, over the past 18 months to two years, is an increase in turf wars and serious crime, including firebombing, particularly in Melbourne and Brisbane, to protect their turf.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I call on the government to increase the penalties for tobacco offences, to work with the states and territories to implement compatible licensing systems and to ensure that multijurisdictional responses can be adequately funded because, without the simultaneous implementation of those three measures, we're not going to make a dent in this illegal industry.</span>

The funding is for a new model that will span three key areas: enhancing preborder intervention to stem the flow of illicit tobacco to Australia; enhancing detection, disruption and destruction both at the national border and alongside our state and territory partners for enhanced domestic enforcement—and this also includes trialling new AI-enabled technology to detect the illicit tobacco threat and complex concealments at the border; and connecting all key stakeholders across the Commonwealth, states and territories, and across health and law enforcement to improve our collective effect.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The funding outlined on 14 January of this year is in addition to the support already provided by the government in funding the Illicit Tobacco Taskforce. This taskforce forms part of a broader Border Force response to the threat of illicit tobacco and contributes to a whole-of-government effort by proactively targeting and disrupting significant and serious actors and organised crime groups that deal in this illicit trade. Our border agencies are seizing record numbers of illicit tobacco. Last financial year, Australian Border Force made over 120,000 detections of illicit tobacco, seizing over 1.77 billion cigarettes and over 867 tonnes of loose-leaf tobacco. And Border Force is on track to seize even greater quantities of tobacco this year. But what are we doing beyond border enforcement—because that alone won't eliminate the issue throughout Australia or, indeed, in the state of New South Wales, because it is a complex and it is a multifaceted issue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government, the Albanese Labor government, is tackling the issue head-on, working with justice and law enforcement, those in health portfolios, and state and territory governments. I want to come back to the fact that we are working to dismantle these criminal syndicates that have a significant part of their trade in the illicit vape and tobacco space.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that illicit tobacco and, in particular, illicit vapes can have a significant effect on a person's health. I've seen it in the emergency department. I've also seen it in my time in the intensive care unit. One of those illnesses, particularly with vapes and illicit vapes, is a condition called EVALI, which is e-cigarette or vaping product use associated lung injury. EVALI is linked to these illegal vapes and how they heat up the vapour, which can then destroy the lung parenchyma, or the functional units of the lungs. What happens is that these electronic cigarette and vape cartridges can be refilled with illicit substances from illicit sources, and they can be contaminated with vitamin E acetate, and that is really strongly associated with this EVALI, the lung injury associated with vaping and the like. And that's not just from observational studies where patients have had imaging and pathology testing; this has actually been from bronchoalveolar lavage—fluid samples that have been obtained from infected patients. Fluid from their lungs has been taken as a sample and sent to pathology, and that's had a direct link back to this lung injury. That's one example of how illicit vapes can have an effect on patients throughout Australia. It's also been associated with the development of acute eosinophilic pneumonia—again, an inflammatory issue that affects the lungs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Both of these have a significant impact on a patient's respiratory function and also have an effect on a patient's ability to combat infection and, if they have an infection, to clear that problem with their lungs. This is a really, really big issue that we have seen with illegal vapes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why we've taken the time to ensure that there are penalties in place for those people that are breaking the law. Looking at the maximum penalty for illicit tobacco offences under the Customs Act, it's 10 years imprisonment and a monetary penalty of five times the duty evaded. The maximum penalty under the Taxation Administration Act is up to 10 years imprisonment. So there are significant penalties that are in place. This is a big issue throughout Australia, and this government is committed to ensuring that people aren't affected by illicit tobacco and vapes.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr LLEW O'BRIEN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wide Bay</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:20</span>):  I rise to speak on the motion in the name of the member for Cowper relating to illicit tobacco and vapes in our community and the sale of them. As we've heard from speakers previously, it is a major problem in all of our communities. It's continuing to spread. It really does represent a failing of government on a number of levels. I'm not suggesting for a minute that this is something that has started since the last federal election. I'm not casting aspersions on the other side for that. This is something that has been happening for a long time. Governments at all levels have failed to step in and stop it. What we've had is a health approach—an approach towards smoking and the health related aspects—an increase in excise and the measures that have been introduced. That's all good and well, but, at the other end, we haven't had the policing, the enforcement and the awareness around the illicit market, which has burgeoned, absolutely exploded, with the unaffordability of legal tobacco.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate alone, in Wide Bay, I've had two shops firebombed—firebombed, in Australia! It's something we don't often hear about. In Victoria last year, there were over 30 shops firebombed. As a former policeman, when I hear that it's organised crime—very sophisticated syndicates, with resources—firebombing the shops, targeting people who aren't earning the right amount of money for their commitment to this illegal trade, what I think is, 'You can't hide a fire bomb, but how many people are being stood over and beaten up who are not going to go to the police, because they've been threatened by an organised crime syndicate or gang?' To use an old expression, they get their kneecaps broken, and they're threatened: 'If you go and tell the police, we're going to get your family.' Well, you're never going to hear about those.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a failing of government, because we have turned what is a health issue into a major crime issue. We've got gangs and syndicates with international reach that are plying their trade. When you look at the numbers here—$4.2 billion of excise and millions of tonnes of tobacco being seized—this is a problem that we need to address. As I said as I started my speech, I want to work with the government to stop this. At the end of the day, there is something that people need to remember here. When you go in and buy these cigarettes, this illicit tobacco, you might think to yourself, 'Stuff the tax man; he is taking money off me. I'll get around that and buy these illicit products,' but you've got to remember that these transactions are not victimless. With that transaction to buy that illicit tobacco, a bit of that money is going into the coffers of an organised crime syndicate who are dealing in human trafficking and the prostitution of young and vulnerable women. All of these heinous offences are also contributed to by the same gangs that are giving you your cheap cigarettes. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, I'll do anything I can to work with the government and to talk to all levels of government to bring about change because this is a problem that has the potential to harm Australians. In both a smoking and a health way it's been a failure, but now in a crime way it's a failure.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HVO" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr NEUMANN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Blair</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:25</span>):  Engaging in the illicit tobacco trade is a very serious offence, and it deprives the Australian community of the kind of funding that we need for our hospitals, schools, infrastructure and essential community services. Tobacco is illicit when it's grown, manufactured or produced in Australia without an appropriate export licence, even if that tobacco is intended for personal use, or when it's imported into the domestic market without customs duty being paid. It's illegal to grow tobacco in Australia without the appropriate excise licence, and in Australia there have been no licensed tobacco growers since 2006 or manufacturers since 2015.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The illicit tobacco market has been a growing concern for law enforcement around the world. It's a key concern here in Australia and also for health agencies. It undermines tobacco control policies designed to reduce levels of smoking, and it involves organised criminal gangs, as the member for Wide Bay said so eloquently, who are involved in the importation, manufacture and distribution of illicit tobacco products. The WHO Framework Convention on Tobacco Control was the first global health treaty developed in response to the tobacco epidemic. It's an evidence based treaty that reaffirms the right of all people to the highest standard of health. The convention came into force in February 2005, and it has 181 signatories, including Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are generally two types of illicit tobacco products produced: loose-leaf tobacco and pre-rolled cigarettes. The first type is often called chop-chop, or molasses tobacco, and the second is counterfeit tobacco or contraband tobacco. This is so prevalent in Australia. There is no level at which tobacco consumption could be considered healthy in this country. I applaud the sentiment of the motion and the seriousness with which people on both sides have taken to the issue today. The reality is that we've had to play catch-up, and that's the truth of the matter. For our part, the government have put in place a range of strong measures and serious resources to address the problem.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a trade engaged in by organised criminals across the country, and it's growing very rapidly. Organised criminals are ignoring the law and opening shops that sell these products without fear of prosecution, and that's happening all too often. This is undercutting legitimate businesses, and many have come to see me. I've met retailers in my electorate who are concerned about the impact of the illicit trade on their business.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government is ramping up compliance to address illicit tobacco and work with the relevant agencies. In January we announced a major Australian Border Force crackdown on the importation of illegal tobacco to ensure we put a tough cop on the beat, and there was a massive increase of $188.5 million over four years to deliver a new compliance model in partnership with the states and territories. Under this new national approach, the ABF will lead Commonwealth, state and territory organisations in a coordinated effort. This is a strengthened package. When we were in opposition we did support the previous government's creation of the Illicit Tobacco Taskforce, in July 2018, and the motion acknowledges that. It's all about deterring illegal tobacco use and distribution and sending a clear message to crooks and syndicates that dealing in illegal tobacco is a serious offence involving a serious tax crime, and people should be aware of that. There are long periods in jail and high penalty units.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This new model strengthens our existing efforts by working in partnership with the states and territories, and I want to assure the member for Cowper that we will work across jurisdictions in this space. In my home state of Queensland we've introduced a licensed scheme for the sale of tobacco, and it makes it an offence to supply illicit tobacco or for retailers to even store illicit tobacco, including with severe penalties for doing so. Of course it's not just a budgetary problem; it's a health challenge and a challenge to our border security. It's estimated that, every day, about 50 people die in Australia of a smoking related illness.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have to reduce the availability of illicit tobacco, and that's critical to tobacco control. We know that the main driver involves criminal activity, but we need to engage in a health response, and that's why the things that we did when Nicola Roxon was the health minister, like plain packaging and education programs, were so critical. Increased investment in health to get people away from the scourge of and addiction to tobacco was so important. It's about enforcement on the one hand and a health response on the other. That's why the Albanese Labor government is so committed. We need to work together across parties and jurisdictions in this space. We need to make sure the ABF have the ability to stop illicit tobacco at the borders and before it ever reaches our shores, our air or our seaports. We need to stamp it out to the best of our ability, with criminal prosecution at the state and federal levels.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="300147" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr VIOLI</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Casey</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:30</span>):  It's a pleasure to rise and speak on and pay tribute to the member for Cowper for this very important motion. As a society we're becoming more and more aware of the challenges illicit tobacco poses for individuals and the health of our society. At the moment, it is having impacts through increased crime. I know, in my community, we recently had a tobacconist firebombed, and that store was destroyed. It's the flow-on effect to other businesses around there. I know a bit of an icon in the Seville community, Branded Burgers, is next door to that tobacco station. They still haven't opened weeks and months after that firebombing, as their store was damaged in that fire. Innocent businesses have been impacted across the state. In my community, it's had a significant impact.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But not just the stores are impacted. You need to remember that CFA volunteers in my community had to go out and risk their lives—risk danger through chemical contamination and things like this—to make sure that fire was put out and didn't spread to other buildings that were all connected through that strip of shops. I want to pay tribute to the Seville CFA and the other brigades from Wandin, Hillcrest, Gruyere and Coldstream that came to support them when that Seville fire happened. It's an example of the ripple effect if we don't get illicit tobacco, which is driven by organised crime, under control.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One thing we don't talk about too often is that the crime is very much in our face. There is a significant economic impact as well, with $4.2 billion in lost revenue to the government through illicit tobacco, because they're not paying the taxes and excise. That's significant money that could be spent on other initiatives, like health initiatives, getting the budget in better nick and spending money on schools and hospitals. That is money that should be going to worthy causes that is not, because of illicit tobacco.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are lots of other negative impacts that we sometimes don't talk about. Talking to many retailers in my community, across the state and across the country as well, we're facing a situation where families and small-business owners are coming to a really difficult choice that they have to make. We need to acknowledge this reality for these businessowners. If you have a legitimate convenience store, retail outlet or IGA—those kinds of stores—and you sell tobacco, if an illicit store moves into your community, your sales will drop significantly overnight. I'm not a huge fan of smoking. I never have been and never will be. But it's a legal product the use of which people choose to partake in. If a business is selling it, in many cases what's happening is that a family business has taken on a loan and potentially put their house on the line. They're watching a significant driver of their revenue and of the foot traffic into their stores drop, as people buy other products that drive sales in their store. Many families are now faced with a choice: do I continue to follow the law and watch my business go under, or do I start to join in this illegal activity? We need to clamp down on the illicit tobacco industry to make sure businessowners and families aren't faced with that tragic choice.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've got options. Something was raised with me just last week by a retailer. We all remember the plain-packaging laws that were bought in previously. There's a $10,000 fine for every packet that doesn't meet the regulation. The reality is that the packets that come in from overseas and are sold illegally don't meet those regulations. This is an opportunity for the government to work with the appropriate authorities at state and territory and council levels to start blitzing those small businesses that are breaking the law and selling packaging that doesn't meet those regulations. If you start to blitz and fine them $10,000 for every packet, word's going to go out pretty quickly and they are going to start to take those products off the shelf.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to act. This response has been too slow. There's this existing lever, as I have just mentioned. There is the Illicit Tobacco Taskforce that the previous government brought in in 2018. There are many more options and many more levers that could be pulled. But, again, we are seeing this government be too slow to react and too reactive. It's letting others push this agenda. The member for Cowper's driving this agenda because this government is, again, asleep at the wheel. It is the Australian people, the people in my community, who are put in danger because of that. </span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr ANANDA-RAJAH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Higgins</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:35</span>):  As I've said in this chamber before, I saw the physical effects of nicotine addiction up close and personal when I practised in a hospital. It results in accelerated atherosclerosis, which pretty much affects every single blood vessel in the body. Large organs are affected as well as small organs and everything in between. It results in stroke, heart attack and peripheral vascular disease, which then leads to serial amputation. The health effects of nicotine addiction are well recognised but probably less so are the societal hazards, although they are now becoming more evident in our streets and suburbs, particularly in Victoria.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The damaging effect of illicit tobacco in Australia is complex and requires a coordinated response across multiple jurisdictions, state and federal, as well as multiple departments. The illicit tobacco trade includes the unlicensed production or importation of tobacco plant or leaf and manufacturing of tobacco products. These activities are conducted by highly adaptive criminal organisations and can involve violence, including arson and assault, and result in evasion of tax and duties needed for the provision of other government services, such as, for example, health care or education. This unlicensed access to tobacco products by Australians of all ages results in worsening nicotine addiction.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was the Labor government under Gillard and health minister Nicola Roxon that introduced plain packaging. It was a world first. Labor governments have a proud legacy of tobacco control. That one single intervention drove smoking rates down and it has been picked up by multiple other countries around the world. Now we are in a fight for our lives with respect to illicit tobacco. As a government, we are tackling the issue head on by working across justice, law enforcement and health portfolios, as well as state and territory governments. The Australian Border Force has seized illicit tobacco being imported into Australia that has equated to over 1.7 billion illicit cigarettes and over 867 tonnes of looseleaf tobacco—it's mind-boggling—in the last financial year alone and local raids of illegal suppliers has produced quick wins. The Illicit Tobacco Taskforce across the Australian Border Force, ATO, the Department of Home Affairs, the Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre and the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission, as well as the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions, are targeting these criminal syndicates that are having the greatest impact in Australia and tackling activities at all points of the supply chain—offshore importation and production and domestic manufacture and sale.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We hear criticism that we are not doing enough when in fact we are doing a lot and it is being coordinated across multiple facets, multiple jurisdictions and multiple departments, such is the complexity. The syndicates are highly adaptive. There's so much money flowing through these syndicates. But we owe it to the Australian people to try to smash them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Penalties are significant. For example, the maximum penalty for illicit tobacco offences under the Customs Act is 10 years imprisonment. It comes with a monetary penalty of five times the duties evaded or both. In January of this year the Albanese government announced a major Border Force crackdown on the importation of illegal tobacco and $188.5 million has been committed over the next four years to the Australian Border Force to deliver a new compliance model, in partnership with states and territories.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Border Force will lead Commonwealth state and territory partners in a coordinated effort to tackle all aspects of illicit tobacco. The model has three prongs. The first is to stem the flow of illicit tobacco into Australia. This means that the ABF, with international partners, will work to target and disrupt illicit tobacco in source and transit countries before it even reaches our borders. We will boost ADF capacity to combat illicit tobacco trade at the border, and we will bring together stakeholders to deliver a coordinated, multi-agency and multijurisdictional response across states and territories.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">
                  </span>As I said, this is only one facet of the broad agenda that we have with respect to tobacco control. We are also targeting vapes, as this is a scourge for our youth that is essentially a gateway drug into nicotine addiction. In the middle of this year we'll be introducing legislation to finally see these vapes off our streets and out of our suburbs. We would like to ensure that our schoolchildren can go to school without being targeted by vape stores.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="7K6" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ENTSCH</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Leichhardt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:40</span>):  I rise to speak on this motion about illicit tobacco, which is certainly a matter of significant concern not only in my electorate but across our nation. The burgeoning illicit tobacco trade is an issue that affects public health, economic stability and law and order in our country. We're all aware of the staggering financial implications of this illegal trade—billions lost in potential revenue, a sum that could boost our public services and infrastructure. The issue runs deep—deeper than just the taxation revenue gap. It's a matter of national integrity and public safety. The reality we face is one of organised crime flourishing under the veil of the illicit trade, where the hard work of our law enforcement is continually undermined by the increasingly brazen and whack-a-mole style resilience of their operations. The current situation is deteriorating rapidly and requires greater attention and decisive action from the government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The real-world ramifications of this issue are best articulated through the experiences of small-business owners like Pamela, who owns a series of legitimate tobacconist outlets in Far North Queensland. Her account and those of many others in the industry paint a stark picture of the rapidly growing challenges faced by law-abiding businesses due to the rapid growth of the black market. Pamela describes the increasing struggle to survive being viciously undercut by illicit operators, who are brazenly operating in broad daylight whilst avoiding tax and evading the strict and onerous regulatory controls that ordinary tobacconists must adhere to.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With around 50 black-market retail shops operating in Far North Queensland, and nine in Cairns alone, the scale of the problem is undeniable. The solution is not to raise the tobacco excise even further, as Minister Butler has sought to do in recent times. We are only pushing the legal operations to the brink while forcing smokers to the black market and denying ourselves taxation revenue in the process. The pricing disparity between legal and illegal tobacco products is central to this issue. Illegal operators can procure a 20-pack of cigarettes for as low as $1 or $2, while legal operators face excise and GST of $28 per pack. Consequently, while a 20-pack of cigarettes from black-market operators can cost as little as $10 or $15, the cheapest legal retail option is significantly higher, around $33. For roll-your-own tobacco, illegal operators often sell a 25-gram pouch for $20. This is particularly concerning when considering that the legal operators, on the cheapest 25-gram packs, face excise and GST costs alone of $52 per pack, pushing the retail price to around $57. The margin that legal operators have to work on is razor thin, while the black-market operators effectively have an unchecked licence to print money.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As well intended as those opposite might suggest the new federal tobacco excise increases are, the fact remains that this approach is fundamentally flawed and, in many cases, leads to significantly worse outcomes for all involved. If the government is going to charge an astronomical amount of excise on a product, it has to be prepared to back it up with an extraordinary law-enforcement regime. Right now there is far too much illicit tobacco getting through the border. Illegal operators are unperturbed by the insufficient law-enforcement efforts, and they are quite literally making more money than the drug trade. We're seeing routine bombing, ram raids and escalating violence against tobacconists all across the country. The government seems to be quite content to send legal tobacconist operators to the brink of bankruptcy. All the while, ex-smokers are returning in droves and handing over their cash to these brazen, violent criminals. The government needs to get its act together on this issue. It's absolute madness, and it's getting worse. It needs to be stopped without delay.</span>

Executive Director Adam Zarth described the property boom within the Illawarra as being great news for investors and property owners but terrible news of first home buyers, renters, low-paid workers and the many employers who rely upon them. You don't have to look too far to see this reinforced in the pages of our <span style="font-style:italic;">Illawarra</span><span style="font-style:italic;">M</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ercury</span>, painting a distressing picture of what is all too common and familiar in our regions.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">How we house Australians is at the forefront of my mind and at the forefront of the mind of this government.

This includes the single biggest investment in social and affordable housing in more than a decade, with the $10 billion Housing Australia Future Fund. It is now established, and the first round of applications closes this week.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">On top of this, the Albanese Labor government's expanded Home Guarantee Scheme has supported more than 100,000 people into homeownership since the election, including over 1,500 people in the Illawarra, Shoalhaven and Southern Highlands. The scheme—comprised of the First Home Guarantee, the Regional First Home Buyer Guarantee and the Family Home Guarantee—helps eligible homebuyers secure finance sooner, through government support and deposits of as little as two to five per cent. We know that the family home and the structure inside it may look very different to how it did when I was a child. It is imperative that governments can adapt policies to keep up with a changing society. That is why, last July, we opened up the First Home Guarantee and the Regional First Home Buyer Guarantee to joint applications between friends and family members, not just single, married or de facto applicants.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The CoreLogic <span style="font-style:italic;">R</span><span style="font-style:italic;">egional </span><span style="font-style:italic;">m</span><span style="font-style:italic;">arket </span><span style="font-style:italic;">u</span><span style="font-style:italic;">pdate</span> for February 2024 revealed that average housing prices have increased by 44 per cent over the last five years. In the early 1990s, it would take the average Australian about seven years to save for a deposit for a typical dwelling; now it takes almost 12 years to save the same amount. That's why we introduced legislation to establish a national shared-equity scheme, called Help to Buy. Eligible participants will only need a two per cent deposit for Help to Buy, and the cost of a mortgage will be reduced by up to 40 per cent for low- and middle-income earners. We know that many renters could maintain a mortgage but can't afford the deposit. This will help more Australians get over the hurdle of a deposit and enjoy ongoing savings thanks to smaller repayments.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Standing in the way are the Liberals and the Greens political parties, delaying real progress and hurting real people. The HAFF was held up for six months whilst those opposite procrastinated. Every day of delay meant more Australians without a roof over their head. Mandy Booker, the formidable CEO of the Wollongong homeless hub, invited politicians who had blocked the HAFF to join her frontline staff and explain to the 13 children currently in crisis accommodation and the 57 children in transitional accommodation why they do not have a home to go to.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">To those opposite, I say: stop standing in the way of vital support which will help renters into the security of homeownership. The Albanese Labor government have a mandate to deliver this critical new support, and we know that it will be life changing for tens of thousands of Australians. Addressing the housing crisis is part of our larger agenda to make sure that no-one is left behind or forgotten.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 1 July this year, Labor will deliver a tax cut for every Australian taxpayer. We want Australians to earn more and keep more of what they earn. The changes mean all 13.6 million taxpayers will receive a tax cut—2.9 million more than would have benefited from Scott Morrison's plan five years ago.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hughes</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:50</span>):  I rise to speak on the motion brought by the member for Cunningham relating to the Labor Party's supposedly broad and ambitious housing policy. I do thank the member for bringing this to the House's attention because, yet again, it is an opportunity for me and for those on my side to point out some of the failures of the government's housing policy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">First of all, this motion focuses on the Home Guarantee Scheme, which was of course started under the former coalition government. I do commend the honourable member and indeed the government for continuing this very successful program initiated by the former coalition government. But, otherwise, I'll use this opportunity to speak against this motion and again highlight the government's flawed housing policy which, it has said, will deliver 1.2 million homes over five years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That was said by National Cabinet, the Minister for Housing and the Prime Minister late last year. But, a bare couple of weeks later, New South Wales Premier Chris Minns came out and said that he can't meet his government's target of 75,000 per year. For the government to build 1.2 million new homes over five years it would need 240,000 homes to be built every single year for the next five years. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a great shame that the government cannot and will not deliver on this policy, because housing affordability in this country is a national crisis. The crisis has well and truly peaked under the Labor government. It is a national shame that millennials and generation Z have all but given up on the great Australian dream of homeownership. The high cost of housing is mostly due to a lack of supply, and this motion is silent on this pervasive problem. The Labor government is silent on how to solve supply. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let us just look for a moment at what has happened under this government. The number of loans provided for the purchase or construction of new homes has fallen to the lowest level since the GFC in 2008. The number of first home buyers remains at the lowest level since the Gillard government. The ABS has highlighted that the September 2023 quarter was the weakest quarter of construction in more than a decade. The data also showed a significant 1.7 per cent drop in detached houses that commenced construction in the 12 months to September 2023, and lending for new homes remained at a 20-year low in September 2023. In addition, new house building approvals have dropped to a decade low. Further escalating the housing affordability crisis, we've now seen 12 interest rate rises since Labor's election, which have added an extra $25,000 to an average mortgage of $750,000.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This motion brought by the member for Cunningham also speaks about the Help to Buy program, but this is a small, niche program, open to only 10,000 households each year for four years. It's going to cost the Commonwealth $5.5 billion, and, as always, with Labor's policies and legislation, the devil is in the detail. Most of this detail has been omitted. It's said to be a shared-equity scheme where new buyers will share ownership of up to 40 per cent with the Commonwealth government. This means that the government will own almost half of these people's property. We don't think this is something that Australian's want. Shared-equity schemes in the UK have just folded because the government ultimately found that it was simply inflationary. The eligibility criteria has been set by the government as $90,000 income for a single person and $120,000 for a couple, but what happens if they receive a significant pay rise? Do they then have to opt out of the scheme? Do they then have to repay the money? What happens with repairs and maintenance? The government is silent on all of these details.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Federal Labor said that it would cap the scheme at $950,000 in metropolitan New South Wales. In my electorate of Hughes, you pretty well cannot buy a property for under $1 million, so there is nobody in my electorate that would be able to avail themselves of this scheme. Therefore, I say that the government still has it wrong on housing policy. The Help to Buy scheme is not going to help most Australians—1.2 million homes in five years is a pipe dream.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PERRETT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moreton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:56</span>):  The Albanese Labor government is committed to taking action on housing to support more Australians to own their own homes and to ensure renters get a fair deal. The challenges in the housing sector today were not created by Labor, but we take responsibility to urgently deal with them. We're addressing a decade of dithering by the former coalition government by committing $25 billion in new housing investments over the next decade. What are the coalition and the Greens doing? They're intent on saying no to reform and no to action to resolve housing issues. The message to aspirational homebuyers is clear: the coalition and Greens don't want to help you into a home. The only thing they're saying yes to is the delaying of measures that will make real differences to Australians either looking to buy their own home or needing to access a rental property.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor understands how crucial it is to have a safe and stable place to live. We know that everyone needs somewhere to call home and that everyone needs to know the roof over their head is secure. That's why the Albanese Labor government has an ambitious housing reform agenda and why we've already made significant progress.  Labor expanded the Home Guarantee Scheme by widening eligibility requirements to the First Home Guarantee and Family Home Guarantee schemes, which means that more people are able to secure finance sooner with government support, and the Family Home Guarantee was opened up to eligible borrowers who are single legal guardians of children, such as aunts, uncles and grandparents. The Home Guarantee Scheme has supported more than 100,000 people into homeownership since May 2022, with almost one in three first home buyers accessing the scheme. We also delivered the new Regional First Home Buyer Guarantee three months ahead of schedule, in October 2022, and assisted more than 15,000 people into homeownership.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government's housing agenda is also having a positive impact in my home state of Queensland. The Miles Labor government is making Queensland the first jurisdiction to progress the Help to Buy legislation, which is now in the Senate. Nationally, Help to Buy will support 40,000 Australians, over four years, to buy a home. Eligible homebuyers with a deposit of just two per cent will benefit from an equity contribution from the government of up to 40 per cent, or 30 per cent for existing homes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am calling on the Liberals and the Greens to say yes to the 40,000 aspirational Australians who are waiting for a chance to make their homeowning dreams come true and to pass this crucial legislation. Labor is leading collaboration with the states and territories to help them meet the target to build 1.2 million new homes over five years, from July, through $3 billion new homes bonus and the $500 million Housing Support Program. This is in addition to the Housing Accord, which supports states and territories to build 10,000 affordable homes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To the more than 30 per cent of Australians who are renting a home: Labor has your back! The $10 billion Housing Australia Future Fund will provide 30,000 new social and affordable rental homes. That's building on the $2 billion Social Housing Accelerator for 4,000 new rental homes. Our better deal for renters gives renters extra security. For the first time in Australian history, we're moving towards a nationally consistent policy to require genuine reasonable grounds for eviction. We're also leading efforts with the states and territories to improve conditions for renters. We're focusing on the development of minimal rental standards, and we want these standards to limit rental increases to once a year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor knows that times are tough, so to assist with the rising cost of rent we've increased the maximum rate of Commonwealth rent assistance by 15 per cent. Labor is also providing additional support to those experiencing homelessness, with a $67.5 million boost to homelessness funding through the National Housing and Homelessness Agreement. All these reforms amount to the most significant action on housing issues in a generation. As my good friend, the Minister for Housing, said:</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Brisbane</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:29</span>):  In Brisbane and around the country, we are in an acute housing crisis. Today I would like to share the story of one Brisbane constituent in particular: Michelle, who lives on the north side of Brisbane. She's a single mum and essential worker, a nurse. Over the past two years, Michelle has had her rent increased by 150 per cent and is now spending more than 60 per cent of her income just on rent. My team spoke to Michelle on her birthday. She called and said that she couldn't afford to celebrate in any way. She couldn't even afford dinner that night. This hardworking nurse is faced with the prospect of being unable to remain a reasonable distance away from her child's school or her workplace. Faced with diving into debt or homelessness, Michelle expects she will need to leave Brisbane for somewhere more affordable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Essential workers have been priced out of our cities, and this is completely unsustainable. The Greens have proposed a public property developer that would see the government build homes to sell and rent at below-market prices. This would help so many first home buyers and renters like Michelle. We need ambition when it comes to tackling the housing crisis, and right now we are not seeing it from this government. People like Michelle and people right across Brisbane deserve so much better.</span>

However, Ramadan this year will be different for many in my community. It will be a much more solemn month, overshadowed by Israel's military operation as it enters its sixth month, causing one of the largest humanitarian crises of the 21st century.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The level of destruction that we are seeing in the Occupied Palestinian Territories is harrowing. In Gaza, 1.7 million people have been displaced, and the death toll now sits at more than 31,000. More than 12,000 of those are children. Children are dying of malnutrition. This is unacceptable. More children have been killed in Gaza in the last five months than in all conflicts worldwide in the past four years. Gaza has now become the most dangerous place in the world if you are a child, according to UNICEF.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Israel must let in more humanitarian aid. There are tonnes of supplies sitting at crossings, being denied access by the Israeli government. There must be an immediate humanitarian ceasefire, and there must be an enduring two-state solution with an independent Palestinian state. This is the bare minimum needed to alleviate the suffering of the Palestinian people.</span>

I'd like to congratulate the following winners: World Street Eats, Enginuity Power Solutions, Merch Window, Clifford Craig Foundation, illuminate Education Australia, Casalinga Gourmet Meats, Walker Designs, Beta Park Bouldering, Zanetto Builders, Junction Arts Festival, Cavalletti Communications, Du Cane Brewing and Launceston City Mission.</span>

This specialist GP clinic offers services in women's health. The brains behind the bubble, Dr Natasha Vavrek, has truly built an exceptional healthcare service, and the additional recognition of being awarded Young Professional of the Year is very fitting.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was also wonderful to see Jimmy Tsinoglou AM and Josef Chromy AO recognised with an induction into the hall of fame and life membership respectively. Jimmy, also a former mayor of Launceston, arrived from Greece in 1955 and worked for the hydro scheme for three years before starting his first shop in Charles Street in 1966. Josef's story of arriving as a refugee in Australia from the former Czechoslovakia is renowned. He's also so deserving of this rare life membership. My hearty congratulations go to all winners and to Jimmy and Josef.</span>

Holi is a festival that symbolises the vibrancy, unity and boundless spirit of our diverse community. Holi is not just a festival of colours; it transcends boundaries, bringing together people of all backgrounds, ages and beliefs in joy and friendship. It is a celebration of renewal, forgiveness and the triumph of good over evil. It symbolises the arrival of spring, a time of new beginnings and fresh hope. It teaches us the importance of letting go of past grievances, embracing each other with open arms and spreading love and happiness in abundance.</span>

In today's world, where divisiveness often threatens to overshadow our shared humanity, Holi serves as a powerful reminder of the values that unite us. Happy Holi.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This week showed exactly how much Australians want their government to listen to them. Four days ago I put up a petition calling on the government to fix HECS debts. Already, in four days, more than 55,000 people of all generations and from all states—nurses, teachers, small business owners, professionals, students and retirees—have signed that petition. In four days we have generated what we think is the single-biggest public request ever to address the dreadful problem which is HECS debts. This is our government's chance to show that it is listening to young people. I've asked to meet with the Minister for Education this week, and I will provide him with that petition in person.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is our chance to fix HECS debts. The more people who sign that petition before I meet with the minister, the harder it will be for him to ignore it. Fixing HECS, making housing affordable, making groceries affordable or taking effective action on climate change: there's a lot that we can do to make the next generation feel proud of us. There's a lot that we must do.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macquarie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:36</span>):  It's called 'placement poverty'—that period university students enter when they have to do a work placement to complete their degree but also have to give up their regular paid work to do it. Whether they're teachers or nurses, or one of the many professions where the work placement is mandatory, these students lose out for up to a year across the life of their degrees.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've seen this firsthand. My nearly-30-year-old son Harry returned to uni as a mature-age student to do a full-time primary teaching degree and faces this multiple times a year. He loves the prac experience but he doesn't love what it does to his already-tight student budget. It means sacrificing regular weekday work, and if you already rely on weekend work as part of your income then there's no time to pick up extra hours. Students tell me that it's often parents who provide assistance during these times so that they can pay their rent and eat. But not every student has that option, so I am urging for paid placements. As the recent report from the Universities Accord said, this is one of the things we need to do to help students with the cost of living and to help people from poorer backgrounds to get through uni and not quit simply because they can't afford to do their compulsory placements. It's one of many changes that I'll be urging for so that we give students a quality tertiary education.</span>

But, unfortunately, our local community has not been left unscathed by the Queensland crime crisis. This is the result of unsuccessful policy and a broken system created by the state Labor government. It's ruining livelihoods, hurting families and tearing communities apart. Bonner locals reach out daily to tell me about the crime in their homes, neighbourhoods, sporting clubs and small businesses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just recently, Marilyn, from St Pete's Pantry, rang my office to tell me that they had been broken into, not once but twice. St Pete's is an extraordinary charity in Wynnum which supports the most vulnerable in our community. Their mission is to make sure that no-one goes hungry and, during the cost-of-living crisis, their mission is more important than ever. Whilst, luckily, no-one was hurt, their laptop, which is used by volunteers, and the Bonner Bright Star Award, which they won last year for services to our community, were stolen. I have been able to organise a replacement medal for Marilyn and the team at St Pete's Pantry, but many items are not so easy to replace.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our community deserves better; Queenslanders deserve better. We need a state government which is going to prioritise our safety and which has a plan to overcome this crime crisis. We need a change in Queensland, which is why I'm backing David Crisafulli and his team to make our homes and communities so much safer.</span>

I'll fly in from Canberra at about midnight, have a couple of hours kip and then be out doing the walk, which is 14.5 kilometres, from RAAF Base Darwin out to Robertson Barracks, the home of the 1st Brigade. This walk was started by Dan Hilliard from Mix 104.9 FM, for the March On Challenge, which is the Soldier On fundraiser and contributes to their awesome work of providing mental health services and connections for those transitioning from the ADF into civilian life and for anyone in the veterans and families communities. Soldier On is one of the service providers at the Mates4Mates Veteran and Family Wellbeing Centre that opened in Stuart Park in Darwin last May. I've had the pleasure of spending a bit of time there at Mates4Mates with the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Matt Keogh, and the Assistant Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Matt Thistlethwaite, and seeing firsthand the tremendous work being done by Soldier On, Mates4Mates and the other service providers. As a fourth-generation veteran, I know how important this work is.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Casey</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:41</span>):  It was an exciting weekend in the Yarra Ranges, with many fantastic community events that I had the pleasure to attend and hold stalls at. I started with the Upwey Belgrave RSL's inaugural Family Fun Day and Volunteer Expo. It kicked off in the Dandenong Ranges. It was great fun. It was wonderful to see so many locals there looking at how they can support community organisations in Upwey, Dandenong and the surrounding areas.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then it was Celebrate Mooroolbark, where I had the opportunity to abseil, thanks to the Mooroolbark Scouts group. Ten metres was high. I did survive, and it's good to be here—I didn't need the member for Robertson's medical expertise, luckily! But it was great fun. It was wonderful to see how empowered the Scouts were as abseilers. They were great coaches. I was in good hands. I got to spend some time with my family. My daughter was wrapped to be the judge in the baking competition. She was a very harsh critic, but there was lots of great food there. It was a wonderful time for our community to come together, so congratulations to Renae, the committee and the volunteers on another successful Celebrate Mooroolbark event on Sunday in our community.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gilmore</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:42</span>):  On Friday 8 March we celebrated International Women's Day. I want to give a shout-out to two local International Women's Day events that I proudly attended. In the morning, I attended the IWD breakfast at Nowra High School, where I was proud to deliver the keynote address. It's been 42 years since I started year 7 at Nowra High School, and I couldn't think of anything more delightful than returning to my old school on International Women's Day. I was met by the very capable young female student leaders, teachers and community members. I was particularly impressed by the diversity of community members attending from many local organisations, like health, housing and homelessness workers, and a good contingent of women from HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Albatross </span>and HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Creswell</span>. And it was great to hear from previous student Lisa Horner.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My next IWD event was at Willinga Park, Bawley Point, and was hosted by the Women's Connection of Milton Ulladulla. It was so lovely to see over 100 women from right across our region at this event, from local women as Rural Fire Service volunteers to workers, business owners and many local organisations. Surfing legend and local Pam Burridge was the guest speaker, and Pam talked about her very real and interesting endeavours to achieve equality for female surfers. As one of the organisers said, we don't have to go too far to find inspirational women in our community. Congrats, Nowra High School and the Women's Connection of Milton Ulladulla.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fisher</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:44</span>):  My 19-year-old intern Zac wrote an honest reflection on the great Australian dream. Like so many young Australians, he's worried that his generation will not be able to own their own home. Here's what Zac says:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">However, after almost two years of lacklustre action regarding housing supply from this government it seems that it is no longer a dream but instead a farfetched fantasy.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Our next generation of doctors, teachers, builders, and engineers face a housing market that seems insurmountable.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">In the 12 months to February, the average price of a home rose by close to nine per cent.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">This is greater than wage growth and has pushed home loans to record amounts.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">At the same time, cash rates have skyrocketed following the election of this government, adding thousands of dollars to interest repayments—</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The average Australian mortgage holder is now paying $24,000 a year more in interest payments than they were when we were in government. That's $24,000 after tax—</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Aston</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:46</span>):  Over the past month, I've had the opportunity to visit some of the community groups in my electorate that help people who are really struggling. Food banks, community hubs and neighbourhood houses are critical resources for people to be able to feed themselves and their families, as well as providing educational facilities. They're great places to meet new people and make friends.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've met people like Martina and Nicole. They operate CHAMPION, an acronym for Community Hub and Meeting Place in Our Neighbourhood, which helps provide food relief to the good people of Aston. They celebrated their 10th year just a month ago. CHAMPION are assisting around 400 people per month, with nearly half of those being children. What makes this place different to other relief agencies in the area is that there is no healthcare card needed to access this vital service.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Like I mentioned, it isn't just food that these wonderful organisations have to offer. It's also a sense of connection and belonging. These services are also similar to the ones offered by people like Emily and Keira. They run the fantastic Orana Neighbourhood House, which helps the community foster friendships and grow gardens together in Wantirna South, near where I live. Orana is a place where people can come together to offer each other friendship, encouragement and support. I thank these groups for the fantastic work that they do for the community of Aston and all the wonderful friendships that they foster.</span>

I knew Dean through his role as president of the Lions Club of Ashwood-Mt Waverley. In his first email to me in his capacity as president of the Lions Club, he wrote: 'If you become aware of a member of the community in need, please reach out.' This epitomises Dean's enthusiasm and drive for helping others. He was passionate about attracting new members to the Lions Club of Ashwood-Mt Waverley so that the club could provide more support to people in need in our community. I witnessed firsthand his steadfast determination to be of service and help others. I stood with Dean to sell Christmas cakes at the end of last year.</span>

I wish to extend my heartfelt condolences to the Lions Club and to Dean's family at this difficult time, including his children, Bailey, Lachlan and Greer, and his parents, Neville and Julie, and everyone that knew and loved Dean. Vale, Dean. We will miss you.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mallee</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:50</span>):  I rise today to speak about the need for a heavy vehicle bypass for Mildura in Sunraysia in my electorate of Mallee. On Thursday, I hosted the first round table with stakeholders to support a business case to make a Mildura heavy vehicle bypass a reality. Without trucks, Australia stops, and truckies travelling the Sturt Highway between Adelaide and Sydney are crawling through the many traffic lights on Deakin Avenue or through the seven roundabouts in Benetook Avenue Mildura.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A heavy vehicle bypass will make national transport more efficient, demonstrating Mildura's tri-state importance. A strategic heavy vehicle bypass requires a new bridge over the Murray River. It will shorten freight movement between Adelaide and Sydney by an estimated 40 minutes, getting truckies home sooner and under less pressure. Diverting the B-doubles, B-triples and B-quads out of our bustling regional city will also make local roads safer for schoolchildren, locals and tourists who enjoy the hospitality of our fabulous Mildura CBD.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mildura's heavy vehicle bypass would come at a tiny fraction of the Allan Labor government's '$50 billion Suburban Rail Loop', which has blown out to an estimated total cost, at this point in time, of $96.4 billion. I raise this as a matter of importance.</span>

YMCA ReBuild is a social enterprise in Braybrook that provides training, mentoring and jobs to young people caught in the justice system. In Victoria, the reoffending rate for young people is more than 50 per cent within the first four months of their release. For young people involved with ReBuild, it's less than five per cent. Take Jack, who was in and out of jail from the age of 15. Ten years on, when he decided to change his life, ReBuild was there for him. He's now thriving, having worked on construction and landscaping projects for the past nine months.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">At Ravenhall Correctional Centre, ReBuild staff teach skills, including carpentry and woodworking. The chess sets, furniture and plant pots the young men make are sold through ReBuild's online shop, with proceeds providing more training and job opportunities. On their release from Ravenhall, the men are given wraparound support from a ReBuild case manager. They can also get a job with ReBuild's maintenance team and receive mentoring from qualified crew leaders until they are employment ready.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since 2010, more than 400 young men and women from diverse and challenging backgrounds have gained employment and skills through YMCA ReBuild. This is yet another example of a high impact social enterprise in my electorate.</span>

It began in Adelaide where I attended with the committee chair, Rowan Ramsey MP, and other members of the committee. We heard from around a hundred South Australian growers, progressing to Western Australia in the electorates of O'Connor and Durack where between 600 and 700 people attended the events, culminating in a huge day on the Friday at the Wagin Woolorama, Western Australia's premiere sheep event.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to report on some of the findings of the committee. Firstly, there was anger that Minister Murray Watt has not made the effort to visit regional Western Australia and talk to the farmers whose livelihoods he's about to irrevocably damage. There was also fury that the report of the phase-out panel, which conducted a tour early last year, has not been made public. The feeling of the meeting was that they would like to re-tender their submission to the coalition committee for tabling in the parliament, which we will do. There was serious frustration that WA farmers are not recognised for exporting the highest animal welfare standards in the world to the world, and there were many heartbreaking stories of the financial pain already being suffered on farms due to the collapse in confidence which has impacted saleyard prices. On the day we were at the Katanning saleyards, over 200 sheep had to be destroyed, as they had no commercial value.</span>

Addressing this issue is complex and requires a sustained effort from the government. I'm proud to say that I organised a women's safety roundtable with the Minister for Social Services last week in my electorate of Tangney. We brought together various grassroots organisations from my electorate and beyond to discuss views on the prevention of domestic violence and to listen to stories of survivors and the outcomes that these organisations are achieving. It is essential to keep connecting with grassroot organisations within our community, noting that every one of the attendees continue to work tirelessly to address domestic violence against women and children.</span>

While working in Townsville, in the northern part of my electorate, I had the privilege of a private tour by Wulguru Group's director, Bob McKay, to see the progress of their brand-new rail manufacturing facility. Under the previous coalition government, the group was awarded funding of $11 million through the Northern Australian Development Program. This funding was awarded to establish a new industry or to significantly grow the value of an existing industry and contribute to regional transformational change. The facility, which is under construction, will manufacture rail carriages and components of all configurations which are currently being imported from countries such as China and India. These rail wagons will help increase north Australia's freight capabilities and will be made to meet the demands of the agriculture, resources and general freight industries.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The previous coalition government saw the need to invest in local industries and develop sovereign manufacturing. If COVID has taught us anything, it is the importance of Australian-made. It is an impressive facility, and I'm proud to say it's based in my electorate of Dawson. The team is leading the way, all while creating jobs. Thanks for the tour, Bob, and I look forward to visiting you again soon.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Boothby</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:57</span>):  I'd like to update members on the progress of some of our important local projects in our Boothby, in no particular order. The urgent care clinic at Marion opened in November last year and has already seen over 3½ thousand people. That's 3½ thousand people who didn't have to go to Flinders ED. We've opened an endometriosis clinic at Glenelg, and that's life changing for so many women. We've reopened, after redevelopment, the reserves at Weaver Street, Ballara Street and Hawkesbury Avenue, which have been completely transformed into green spaces with exciting playgrounds and community facilities. I was present at the turning on of the tap for the City of Marion's off-farm water efficiency project. South Australians will remember opposition leader David Speirs selling us up the river on the Murray-Darling Basin Plan when he was environment minister, instead of standing up for South Australia's interest. Shame!</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week we announced the site of the community battery in Edwardstown, the first of many in Boothby, I hope. And we recently turned the sod on the new Eden Hills scout and Rotary hall. We're replacing halls that literally had highlighted holes on the floor so children didn't fall through them. The Majors Road on/off ramp, which will take thousands of cars off Brighton Road every day, is underway. Marion Road and Cross Road tram overpasses are about to start, and we've got new beds opening at Flinders and Repat hospitals. What have I forgotten? Tax cuts for every taxpayer.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Flinders</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:59</span>):  I rise to thank the small businesses who turned out in force to welcome the member for Farrer, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, to Flinders last Friday. Together we visited the nation's best coffee roasters, Little Rebel, to see the production of their beautiful blend of beans. A great innovator, Little Rebel serves up a delicious flat white, great merchandise and—my absolute favourite—a dispensing machine on the front porch in case the<span style="font-style:italic;"></span>unthinkable happens and you run out of beans on the weekend.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We then headed to Boatshed Cheese, a family business in the industrial estate which makes its own goat, buffalo and cow milk cheeses. Sarah and Becky run a tight operation. The cheese is fresh and scrumptious and accompanied by local artisan produce sold directly to visitors who may drop in and also to our local restaurants and cafes and further afield. Then we dropped into the world-famous Bass &amp; Flinders, 100 per cent female owned and run. CEO Holly Klintworth also runs the Australia Distillers Association. Bass &amp; Flinders is the gin sponsor of the Melbourne International Flower and Garden Show this weekend, with their bespoke addition Bloom Gin.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we joined friends at a small-business round table filled to overflowing in the boardroom of Smart Business Solutions. Construction, horticulture, hospitality, disability services, retail logistics, transport and vocational training all explained to us how hard they are doing it right now. Mortgage and business loan stress after 12 interest rate rises under this government, surging land tax under their comrades in Spring Street and the cost-of-living pressures are closing the family wallet shut.</span>

Thousands of men, women and children are being injured and thousands are dying every day. It is catastrophic. The health system has collapsed. Most hospitals are out of service. There are significant shortages of fuel and water, meaning that emergency medical and surgical services have ceased operations throughout Gaza. Think about this: surgeons are undertaking major surgical procedures and interventions without anaesthesia or analgesia. Patients and medical staff are being injured and killed. MSF doctors—that's Doctors Without Borders—function and operate with the principles of impartiality, independence and neutrality. As a doctor, I can't begin to imagine what it's like to provide care in this environment. People throughout the region do not have access to clean drinking water and food, meaning that dehydration and malnourishment are the norm. This will mean that men and women cannot function or heal and children will not develop into the adults they deserve to be. For the sake of life, people need access to food and water, humanitarian aid must flow and medical staff and services must be able to operate in safety. For the sake of life, this conflict must end.</span>

We all know that behind every member, senator and councillor stands a team of generous and dedicated volunteers. This weekend they came out in full force, and I'm incredibly proud of our efforts. We saw a significant swing in Inala, and I commend Trang Yen for her dedication and hard work.</span>

They are both stand-up, experienced and hardworking community leaders who will no doubt get the job done.</span>

For the last 72 years, Wynnum Manly Ward has been taken for granted by Labor. During this election, locals took a stand. While we don't know the official result yet, either way, Alex has reminded Labor not to take Bayside voters for granted. Alex eagerly listened to locals and energetically stood up against Labor and the Greens, with integrity and positivity the whole way. Well done, Alex, Adrian, Trang, Darren and all the candidates who stood for the LNP. It was a great weekend and a great result.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyons</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:04</span>):  The Australian Tourism Awards were held over the weekend, and I was thrilled but not surprised to see tourism experiences and operators in Lyons so well represented amongst finalists and winners. First, congratulations to the BIG4 St Helens Holiday Park on being selected as a finalist in the Caravan and Holiday Parks category. Big congratulations also go to the Granary at Richmond Hill, taking out the bronze award in the Self-Contained Accommodation category. I know Fiona and Nick were thrilled to make the finals and to win the bronze, and I'd like to take this opportunity to thank them for the care and hard work they have put into that property since making the move to Tasmania about 14 years ago. Silver in the Excellence in Food Tourism category was awarded to the Truffle Farm, home of Australia's first black truffle, which you can find just outside Deloraine. Last but certainly not least: a big shout-out to Bangor Vineyard Shed at Dunalley, who took out the gold in the Tourism Wineries, Distilleries and Breweries category, a well contested field. Congratulations to Matt and Vanessa Dunbabin and their fantastic team at Bangor. These awards represent the gold standard of tourism in this country, and I'm very proud to have tourism experiences and operators from Lyons being recognised and celebrated in such a way.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Longman</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:05</span>):  I rise tonight to speak on behalf of the South Sea Islander community in Queensland. It was brought to my attention over the 12 months ago that the Queensland Museum had in its possession ancestral remains and secret-sacred objects of South Sea Islanders. Queensland United South Sea Islander Council Incorporated, or QUASSIC, have been trying to work with former Premier of Queensland Annastacia Palaszczuk and Minister Leeanne Enoch to repatriate these remains to their country of origin so that traditional South Sea Islander customs and traditions can be honoured.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I encouraged the QUASSIC committee to give the Queensland state government a reasonable opportunity to respond, but it's well over 12 months on and there's still no movement. The Kanaka program was indeed a shameful part of our history in Queensland. However, to their credit, members of this community have quietly gone about their inquiries in a respectful way, which, sadly, has got them nowhere. I'm asking the Queensland government and the federal Minister for International Development and the Pacific, Pat Conroy, to act on this respectful request and ensure that these remains are returned to QUASSIC ASAP on behalf of the nations that they represent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While I'm at it, I was disappointed that the federal government funded Jeremy Donovan, an Australian First Nations man, on a tour to the South Sea Islands but neglected to fund one of the many South Sea Islander descendants of the Kanaka program to join him on the tour. They never even had the decency to engage with QUASSIC and advise them of his visit. Shame!</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Higgins</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:07</span>):  Endometriosis is a chronic disease that affects one in nine women. Because it can implant anywhere in the abdomen and pelvis, causing scarring and bleeding, the symptoms are diverse, ranging from pain, diarrhoea or constipation and painful sex to heavy periods, bleeding from the bladder or bowel, and tummy bloating. The important thing is to keep a diary of symptoms; it will help with diagnosis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Diagnosis is universally late, taking on average seven years, by which time women and girls have suffered from chronic, sometimes crippling pain, mental health problems, career or relationship disruption and the devastating impacts of infertility. Given these unacceptable sequalae, the Albanese government has committed to the establishment of 22 dedicated endometriosis and pelvic pain clinics around Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Endometriosis is the poster child of how women are treated in the health system. Gender bias in health is real, confirmed by a survey of 3,000 women, showing that two out of three women reported health related bias and discrimination. As a former doctor I saw late diagnoses and misdiagnoses all too frequently in women, ranging from cancer to heart disease. Women present differently and get overlooked, dismissed or, at worst, gaslit. The Albanese government's National Women's Health Summit aims to change these outcomes and perceptions. If you need to know more, shun the influencers and head to a reputable website, like the Jean Hailes Foundation.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">McPherson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:08</span>):  Today I'd like to raise the concerns that have been raised with me by many people in my electorate in relation to illicit tobacco. I've been on the record a number of times raising concerns about illicit tobacco products and what they do to our local communities. I'll divide what I'm going to say into two parts.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's clearly the role of the Australian Border Force in making sure that illicit tobacco products are not coming across the border, and there's the need to make sure the Australian Border Force is properly resourced to do that work. We don't want illegal products coming in, and there is significant evidence that illicit tobacco is often used to test the drug routes into this country. We know that the hardened criminals and gangs are very likely to use tobacco to check whether or not it's possible to bring significant truckloads or container loads of product into this country, and we need to get on top of that to make sure that we are getting drugs off the street.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At a local level we have legitimate sellers of tobacco, our retailers here, who are losing significant amounts of money because tobacco is effectively being sold under the counter. We need to crack down on this and make sure that we have appropriate taskforces in place to deal with this. I will stand by those people in my community who are losing tens of thousands of dollars in trade every single month.</span>

There was an electric buzz in the room at Mineral Resources Park, the home of the mighty West Coast Eagles, on 8 March. This was because I co-hosted the Swan International Women's Day awards and breakfast with Jacaranda Community Centre. The breakfast brought together over 230 local women and allies from all across the electorate. It was incredible. It was an inspiring morning, and we held this because we wanted to celebrate the amazing achievements of women in Swan.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Calare</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:11</span>):  The year was 1990: the Holden Racing Team won its first Bathurst 1000; 'Nothing Compares 2 U', by Sinead O'Connor, was No. 1 on the Australian music charts; and the Central Tablelands Woodcraft club, affectionately known as the Woodies, was born. Over the past 35 years, the Woodies have become an invaluable part of the Bathurst community. Each of the 85 dedicated members share a passion for woodworking and enjoy forging great friendships while making an important contribution to their community. On any given Wednesday, Friday or Saturday, you'll find their workshop, on Dorman Place in Kelso, humming with the sound of saws and lathes, as dozens of woodworkers tinker on personal or community projects. The Woodies are currently repairing and restoring some garden chairs for St Catherine's residential aged care in Bathurst.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently, I caught up with members of the Woodies at the Bathurst Heritage Trades Trail, including with new member Judith Malo. The group is a fine example of how community spirit, a solid collection of power tools, a bit of timber and a cup of tea or two can transform communities for the better. The Woodies also run regular how-to workshops and encourage people of all abilities to discover the joys of woodworking.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I give a big thankyou to the Woodies committee, including President Ian Jackson, Vice-President Doug Kinlyside, Treasurer Chris Curry, Secretary David Tonkin and committee members Peter Brennan, Jim Hallahan, Ron Cambey and Harry Howard, for all of the hard work that they put into ensuring that the Woodies continue to go from strength to strength. Well done to the Woodies, and thank you for all that you do for Bathurst and our region.</span>

Father Nicolaos has served the Greek community of Newcastle with distinction through his work at St Demetrios Greek Orthodox Church since 1973. Born in Greece in 1934, Father Nicolaos had wanted to be a priest from a very young age, but, as he recalls, there were 'not many' churches when he first arrived in Australia, at age 19. Eventually an opportunity arose to be ordained for the City of Newcastle, and, after getting his wife, Nina's, permission and visiting Newcastle to meet with the Greek community, Father Nicolaos and his young family moved from Sydney four weeks later.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now in his 90th year, and having retired as a local priest in 2021, Father Nicolaos continues to lead the chant every Sunday in church, proudly supported by his four children and 10 grandchildren. He has dedicated his life to the service of others, not only through the church but also as a long-term volunteer for local organisations including Meals on Wheels, the Northern Settlement Services, the Ethnic Communities Council and Lifeline. Thank you, Father Nicolaos, for making Newcastle your home for more than 50 years and for your lifetime of service to our community. We are deeply indebted.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's time for Science Meets Parliament. As both an MP and a STEM professional, this is literally a time when my two worlds collide, and, as collision theory explains, for a chemical reaction to occur, particles must collide with one another. So I see this engagement between policymakers and STEM professionals as an exciting opportunity where scientists and STEM professionals can share what is at the forefront of Australian scientific discovery. What I hope is that in return policymakers react with more evidence based decision-making.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have said this before: science in practice today is the technology of tomorrow, and I continue to see that STEM improves our lives in the electorate of Swan. At the inaugural Swan International Women's Day Awards, Swan Scientist of the Year was awarded to the very talented Dr Parwinder Kaur. Dr Kaur is an associate professor in biotechnology; founder of a startup; and is advising JETSI. The coolest thing is that she also maps DNA. This is critical for our understanding; we need to know our genetic past to help solve problems of the future. This is groundbreaking research, and it's important for Australian biodiversity and agricultural advancements.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Parwinder is also an advocate for science communication. She's doing this by bridging the gap between complex research and public understanding, and this is what Science Meets Parliament is all about. The Albanese government is putting science at the forefront of our decision-making, and I will continue to encourage that this happens because I'm passionate about STEM. Amusingly for my staff, we ended up going to Scitech for our 2023 Christmas celebrations. For those who don't know, that's the WA version of Questacon—a bit smaller though! It's where my copper and tellurium shirt is from. People might think it says 'CuTe', but nerds will know what it actually means! While I'm the only STEM professional in my electoral office, it's clear that my passion for science is rubbing off.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On a serious note, I know that science was at the forefront of helping us function as a nation during the pandemic: vaccines were developed at unprecedented rates; network engineers connected us so that scores of people could work from home; and we saw local innovators and manufacturers develop health and safety gear when our global supply chains broke down.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Amber was one of the nominees for one of Swan's International Women's Day science awards. She was nominated for her work and her volunteering in the health profession during the COVID-19 pandemic. She helped the community to keep people safe and informed—an example of the unsung work often done by STEM professionals. Amber was also recognised for her achievements as an exemplary scientist in a predominately male field.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know firsthand that women are underrepresented in the field of STEM. Scientifically, I know that diversity is strength and I see a future where Australia is a STEM superpower. But to do this we need to broaden the mix of STEM professionals. Labor recognises this, and that's why we're working to promote STEM to diverse communities and to provide pathways to it for people from all walks of life. Labor's first step is the Diversity in STEM Review. This review will guide changes to STEM programs to widen their appeal to more women and people from diverse backgrounds.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the next two days, as the Science Meets Parliament meetings continue, I encourage all members of this House and of the other place to explore the opportunities that science and STEM have to offer—to understand the real tangible difference that science makes to people's lives and to listen to the scientists who are at the forefront of discovery and change. We need to understand how we can collaborate to forge a future of scientific wonderment, where science forges a better life for Australians and secures a stable economy. To do this, the Albanese government has backed in the future by backing scientists and by investing in national STEM institutions and education programs. I hope that everyone enjoys Science Meets Parliament.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs ANDREWS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">McPherson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:20</span>):  Can I start by thanking the member for Swan for putting forward this excellent motion, which gives us an opportunity to reach out across what is often a very divided place here and talk about things that are important to the future of Australia, so thank you very much for that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst I was listening to the member speak, it crossed my mind that there will come a day when I am no longer a politician, but I will always be an engineer. Often I laugh and say, 'Given the opportunity of introducing myself as a politician or an engineer, which one would I choose?' I generally choose 'engineer', given the opportunity. I do that for multiple reasons. But I'm very proud of the fact that I did study engineering—and that my elder sister is a graduate in agricultural science. She's got a master's in ag science and psychology—and multiple things, to be honest! She was a STEM professional who encouraged not only me but many other people to follow a STEM pathway.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The substance of this motion, in my view, is really talking about the opportunity for parliamentarians to engage with scientists. Of course, during this week we have the opportunity, as individuals and collectively, to meet with many great scientists. I would also encourage everyone here to do all that they can to take the opportunity to meet with the scientists and listen to what they are saying about the areas in which they have specialised. Some have incredibly deep knowledge that they have garnered over many, many years. We have an opportunity to learn from them and look at what the potential practical implications will be at the intersection between industry and science, which I will come back to.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Deputy Prime Minister and I established Parliamentary Friends of Science well over 10 years ago now, and we have co-chaired it since that time. He and I have done all that we can, in a very bipartisan way, to encourage our colleagues to meet with scientists, to engage with science, to understand all that science can deliver for this country. I think that we would all agree that where we saw science most recently at its best was during the COVID pandemic, when, as a nation, we relied so heavily on so many scientists from so many backgrounds. I can remember taking the call from the minister for health at the time, Greg Hunt, when he said that we needed to manufacture invasive ventilators here. I remember him telling me that we needed 20,000 invasive ventilators—and, quite frankly, we weren't even sure that that was going to be enough at the start of the pandemic. But what happened was that our industrial specialists, our manufacturers, led by our scientists, came together to work out how they were going to make those ventilators here in Australia, and they achieved it. They delivered exactly what was asked of them. They basically started from scratch, because, as we would all remember, it was very difficult to get products in and out of this country. So it was almost a first-principles design from those scientists and engineers who were involved in building those ventilators. Then we saw the work that was being done more broadly across the health sector, with so many professionals stepping up to make sure that they did their very best to keep Australia as safe as they possibly could. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are really very simple and perhaps topical examples of the interaction of science with our everyday lives. I think that it's incumbent upon all parliamentarians to ensure that they are supporting the various science agendas that have been put forward by successive governments. I thank the current government for the work that they're doing, and I would like to reflect, in the last minute or so that I have here today, on some of the work that was done under the coalition government to support science in our communities. The stand-out for me was probably the $1.1 billion National Innovation and Science Agenda. At the time it was quite groundbreaking in terms of what it was doing with industry, innovation and science, and in some of the work that was established there. Things such as crowdsourced equity funding legislation, the $200 million CSIRO Innovation Fund and tax incentives for early-stage investors actually were really positive things to do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What I would hope is that over the coming years we all work together to make sure we build on the strengths of the past and we look forward to all that we can do to ensure that science has a key role in what we are doing here in this country.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Chisholm</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:25</span>):  Of course, this week marks Science Meets Parliament, an event that has become an important one on the Canberra calendar for more than two decades, and an annual highlight for parliamentarians. Science Meets Parliament is open to all Australian STEM professionals in academia, industry and government. This includes PhD students through to leaders in the STEM sector. I'm very grateful to have the opportunity to speak about this today, and I thank the member for Swan for her motion. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Science Meets Parliament provides the opportunity for parliamentarians to directly engage with Australian scientists and is increasingly becoming a powerful vehicle for deep engagement between the STEM sector and policymakers. It plays a crucial role in building relationships and helps to bring STEM expertise deeper into the service of the nation. Activities in the parliament this week include expert-led professional development, a welcome reception, a parliamentary forum, a national gala dinner, a televised National Press Club address and opportunities for delegates to meet in small groups privately with parliamentarians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Science &amp; Technology Australia is Australia's peak body in science and technology, representing more than 225,000 scientists, engineers and technologists. It goes without saying that Australian scientists and science both save and improve lives. I really want to congratulate the team at Science &amp; Technology Australia for all their terrific efforts in pulling together what is sure to be yet another fantastic week for Science Meets Parliament participants. This year's event is the biggest yet, accommodating 391 delegates, 154 early- and mid-career researchers and representatives from 105 federal electorates.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government is on the record as stating that we both recognise and support the contributions that Australian scientists and science make to our nation. Not only does science play an important role in helping Australia solve some of its biggest challenges but it also plays such an important role in bringing diversification to our economy. Indeed, Minister Husic, during Science Meets Parliament activities last year, stated:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Science isn't a nice-to-have only when times are good. It is essential to the prosperity of this country. To our national wellbeing. To being a modern economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my own electorate of Chisholm, we are so fortunate to have some truly outstanding and world-class science organisations, and scientists and researchers based at organisations such as the CSIRO and the Monash Victorian Heart Institute. Earlier this month I had the great pleasure of hosting Minister Husic in my electorate at ANSTO's Australian Synchrotron for a Monash Precinct Network round table. We discussed a range of topics with the minister, including access to the National Reconstruction Fund for small and medium enterprises and ways to support Australian science and manufacturers, to help innovative companies to scale up and to build STEM aspirations in young people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've also seen the value of science meeting parliament in initiatives like the STEM Ambassadors Program. This has allowed me the opportunity to connect with Dr Julia Gilmartin-Thomas, an expert in medicine safety and dementia research and Chisholm's local STEM ambassador. Not only has this program allowed Julia to gain a better understanding of policymaking processes but it has provided me with an improved understanding of the application of science. I really look forward to all of my meetings with Julia and our continued engagement through the STEM Ambassadors Program, including through an allied health research forum later this year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government believes that, by employing Australians' research skills and expertise, we can create new economic opportunities for the country and become a global STEM superpower. Every day in my electorate I see the opportunities with, as I said before, the world-class researchers and world-class scientists there, who want to work in collaboration with one another to help solve the problems that confront our nation and our region. Our government wants to ensure the next generation of scientists has all the skills it needs to solve tomorrow's problems, and events like Science Meets Parliament allow us to take big strides forward and build important and deep relationships between policymakers and scientists.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="300147" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr VIOLI</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Casey</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:30</span>):  Science, industry and innovation form the cornerstone of Australia's economic prosperity. These sectors drive advancements in technology, infrastructure and productivity. They foster growth and competitiveness on a global scale. Through scientific research, discoveries are made that lead to groundbreaking innovations and create new products, services and industries. And industry relies on innovation to remain dynamic, adapt to changing market demands and stay ahead of competitors. This symbiotic relationship fuels economic development, generating jobs, attracting investment and enhancing Australia's reputation as a leader in many fields. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no doubt that, with the economic challenges we face as a nation, we need to invest in science and innovation and industry more than ever, and that's why many in the industry are worried. This motion notes the importance of science in helping Australia solve some of its biggest challenges and diversifying the economy. But I know industry is worried and scientists are worried due to reports earlier this month of some unrest in the cabinet about spending. To quote the <span style="font-style:italic;">Age </span>article:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Industry, Science and innovation Minister Ed Husic had complained directly to Albanese that the cabinet's powerful expenditure review committee—responsible for overseeing ministers' submissions for budget measures—was shutting out ministers from decision-making.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Husic also raised concerns about what he saw as the influence of the committee of two unelected bureaucrats, finance department secretary Jenny Wilkinson and Treasury secretary Steven Kennedy. Some critics claim the pair are holding the government back from spending on Labor policy initiatives. That's a concern for industry—at a time when we need to invest in science and back science, the minister is at war with the Treasurer and the Expenditure Review Committee about what funding will go into this important area. It's another example of the Albanese Labor government failing to understand this new dynamic economy that we operate in. Nothing shows that more than their lack of appointing a minister for the digital economy. There is a need to drive industry, to drive capital investment and to continue to drive those innovative products we have and we require. Again and again, this government is missing these opportunities to drive economic growth for our country. So I hope the member for Swan, who moved this motion and is passionate about science, speaks out tomorrow in caucus and asks the Prime Minister and the Treasurer if they are actually going to back science and put money behind it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to commend Science and Technology Australia for the important work they do. The Science Meets Parliament event is a great event. It's one of the events that I've really enjoyed since becoming a new member of parliament. I particularly want to thank and acknowledge Professor Geoff Brooks from the Swinburne University. He's a resident in Casey. Over the last 12 months, he's been working with me as my science expert through this program. It's been great to talk to Professor Brooks about his different areas of expertise, but he also has the ability to connect me with other experts. One of the things I admire about Professor Brooks is that he knows what he knows, but he's also willing to admit when he's not an expert in an area, which is something we should also do. It's an example of the importance of science and technology and the importance of elected officials relying on experts while also understanding that experts have expertise in that narrow area. Professor Brooks said to me that he looks through problems with a straw, and we need to look broader than that. I appreciate his advice and his counsel.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I look forward to speaking on a panel at Science Meets Parliament on Thursday to share my experiences since being elected. I'm looking forward to meeting and engaging with some scientists that are coming to my office this week. We in Australia have a strong scientific community. It's important that we respect them, that we engage with them, that we listen to them and that we continue to work with them. The Science and Technology Australia event is one of these really important forums to continue. I note, as the member for McPherson said, that the Deputy Prime Minister is a co-chair of the Parliamentary Friends of Science. I hope he can also lend his weight to the member for Swan's work in talking to the Treasurer and the Prime Minister and making sure that science and industry gets the support it needs from this government to help alleviate some of the significant economic challenges we face as a country.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Riverland is Australia's largest wine region area by area and by tonnage. The Riverland GI is 4,105 square kilometres. It includes 22,032 hectares of vineyards. The main varieties grown in the region are shiraz, chardonnay, and cabernet sauvignon. The wine industry is one of the major economic drivers in the Riverland. It's worth around $400 million to the broader economy. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The region produces wines that are consumed in over 70 countries, from both commercial and boutique operators. The Riverland has traditionally exported as much as 3.6 million litres of wine, worth around $10.4 million. In the last decade, however, market factors have seen reduced demand for commercial wines from Australia, significantly impacting on the region. The lack of demand has seen prices for Riverland shiraz, cabernet and merlot fall from around $700 a tonne to just above $200 a tonne in 2023. I've also heard anecdotal evidence of prices as low as $120 a tonne. Prices are expected to fall further in 2024. There is a global oversupply of wine of about three billion litres a year—that's three times Australia's production. This is due to a number of factors: heightened awareness of the importance of health and wellness, competition from other alcoholic beverages, fewer wine drinkers drinking less wine, inflation, cost-of-living pressures et cetera. Australia has the equivalent of 859 Olympic swimming pools worth of wine in storage—that's close to three billion litres.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I wrote to the state and federal ministers in 2022 about the looming crisis bearing down on Riverland wine grape growers, then again in 2023, and again earlier this year. Each time I was met with a standard response talking about efforts to improve trade with China. This freight train has been bearing down on the industry and, despite calls for action over the past 18 months, state and federal governments have been too distracted, or too complacent, to notice. Growers are now at crisis point. Growers in the Riverland are rightfully angry. They've been ignored by those opposite, and now they're being told that trade with China will be the silver bullet that will fix all of their problems. This is blatantly dishonest and, quite frankly, insulting to multigenerational growers, who work their guts out to keep their businesses afloat. Those opposite need to level with growers. No single market will fix this problem.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Global wine production has exceeded supply since 2014. If we look to international examples, there have been plenty of attempts by various wine sectors to trade out of this global oversupply; they have all failed. As far back as 2006, France was dealing with excess production of some 750 million bottles of wine. Growers in Bordeaux have stopped tending to vineyards that are no longer economically viable. Bordeaux's wine industry estimates that 2,000 to 3,000 hectares of vines have been simply abandoned. Abandoned parcels can be reservoirs for the spread of disease. Today, Bordeaux faces the removal of a further nine per cent of the region's vineyards—some 9,500 hectares. Winemakers in Bordeaux are eligible for 6,000 euros per hectare in aid from the French government, either to help pay for the uprooting of their entire vineyard or to convert parts of their wine property to other agricultural pursuits. Well-established, mature markets such as Bordeaux can't even trade out of this crisis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the US, industry leaders have called for growers to remove 50,000 acres, around nine per cent of California's wine-grape-bearing acreage, to achieve market balance. The president of the peak industry group in California, Allied Grape Growers, says they are 'structurally oversupplied' and 'have to adjust their acreage down'. Without government intervention to support growers in this critical period, our sector will experience forced exits; widespread vineyard abandonment, which could lead to significant biosecurity risks; the attrition of younger generations in the affected areas; and adverse mental health consequences, quite obviously.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Government must stop wasting time and must urgently support Australian wine grape growers with a targeted financial support package to help eligible vineyard owners adapt to changing market conditions. We want productive, sustainable agricultural sectors that drive economic growth and feed the nation. I urge those opposite to support growers in the Riverland to keep growing. Don't let them flounder until they've got no choice but to sell their water as desperate sellers. Keep farmers farming.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BRIAN MITCHELL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyons</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:40</span>):  I thank the member for Barker for this opportunity to speak about Australia's wine growers, and it'll probably be no surprise that I'll spend my time talking about the situation in my electorate and across Tasmania. It is a serious issue. Australia is the fifth-largest wine producer by volume in the world, and the hundreds of dedicated producers and the 160,000 people who work in the industry produce excellent product. It's some of the best wines in the world, in fact. In Tasmania, we have more than 200 individual vineyards, and the industry more broadly supports 3,600 full-time equivalent jobs. You may recall, Deputy Speaker, that I just gave my 90-second statement and congratulated Bangor on winning gold in the Australian Tourism Awards for the amazing work that they do with their very high-quality vineyard down there in Dunalley.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A report commissioned by Wine Tasmania at the end of last year found that Tasmania was the only state whose grape-growing workforce grew over the past decade, and it was up by 74 per cent. The same study reported the state's wine industry was tracking to grow to $2 billion annually by 2040. In 2022, the average value of Tasmanian wine grapes was a record-setting $3,237 a tonne, compared to the national average of $630 per tonne. Of course, as the member for Barker has indicated, many growers are now getting much less than that—indeed much less than the cost of production—for what they're growing. But in Tasmania it's a success story.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm always pleased to be able to celebrate the success of the industry in my home state, but we aren't being honest. We aren't being honest about the challenges the industry has been facing over recent years. The total value of Australian wine exports declined by 2.4 per cent to $1.9 billion in the year to December 2023. But the 2023 figures tell only part of the recent story, with exports down by one-third compared to 2021. The decline in exports has been caused, in large part, by ongoing trade disruptions in some of our major overseas markets.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr BRIAN MITCHELL:</span>
                  </a>  The member for Barker doesn't want to hear it, but it's a simple fact that there has been major trade disruption. There are also other shifts occurring, with ongoing changes in consumer preferences having a major impact on prices for the traditional red grape variety that's prevalent in our inland grape-growing regions. It's also a simple case of supply and demand. There's a hell of a lot of supply and there's not the demand to feed the supply. It's basic economics.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the government's primary focus is to support the industry to build long-term sustainable demand for Australian wine, through market diversification and expansion. Introducing and establishing Australia's world-class wine into new markets will help address the imbalance between supply and demand over the long term. There is no short-term fix, and I'll tell the member for Barker that there is no silver bullet. It's a long-term complex problem. Like in all agricultural industries, trade will continue to be critical for the future of our wine industry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is helping industry to grow long-term sustainable demand for Australian wine, through improving market access and trade diversification. The Agricultural Trade and Market Access Cooperation program assists the industry to build long-term sustainable demand, with $3.3 million, through three grants, to Australian Grape &amp; Wine and more than $1.1 million, through two grants, to the Australian Food and Wine Collaboration Group, which includes Wine Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government also continues to pursue ambitious free trade agreements and supports greater demand for Australian wine. The Australia-United Kingdom Free Trade Agreement entered into force on 31 May 2023, for example, eliminating all tariffs on Australian wine. Similarly, an Australia-India economic cooperation trade agreement entered into force on 29 December 2022 lowered tariffs significantly and established a joint dialogue, and the government is negotiating a more comprehensive agreement with India, which of course is a massive potential market.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Closer to home, the Wine Tourism and Cellar Door Grants program supports cellar-door operators to upgrade infrastructure, regional employment and increased demand for Australian wine. Round 5 of that program provided $10 million to 209 wine and cider businesses across the country, of which $500,000 was awarded to Tasmanian operations, including several in my electorate—Derwent Estate, Freycinet, Nocton, Pooley, Stefano Lubiana and Josef Chromy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are doing a lot to support the industry. We acknowledge the serious challenges the industry is facing. But we are there, standing with them, to shoulder the burden.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Nicholls</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Nationals Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:45</span>):  I rise to support the motion put by the member for Barker and acknowledge the serious pain that is going on in his electorate and others due to a range of factors affecting the global wine industry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The wine industry is a significant employer and economic driver in my electorate of Nicholls. We have a number of different wine areas. One is the Nagambie region, an hour-and-a-half drive north of Melbourne. It's got historic wineries and vineyards, such as Tahbilk, which still has vines that were planted in the 1860s and managed to survive the Barossa onslaught and are still producing today. There is also the more modern—when I say 'modern', I mean from the 1970s—winery of Mitchelton. It's not just the wineries in that region but all the contract growers that supply them. I also have the northern end of the Heathcote wine region, which is grown on the wonderful Cambrian soils on the Mount Camel range. Also, there are wineries over at Dookie. Dookie, where I did my agricultural science degree at the University of Melbourne, has been a significant player in research and development in the wine industry over the years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Barker is right: we face a terrible oversupply crisis. This has happened before, and there are issues with this. When a commodity is very much in demand, people want to grow a lot of that commodity. That's fine if we are talking about annual crops, but the challenge with horticulture is that it takes a long time to establish horticultural developments, whether they be apples, pears, peaches or, indeed, wine grapes. People put them in when the prices are good and they get some of the years of those good prices and then we end up sometimes with an oversupply. Some of the taxation treatment in the mid- to late 1990s of agriculture probably didn't help. I think that's something we can all analyse when we go forward and think about how we encourage agricultural production.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to talk about the impact also of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan and the changes that the new Labor government have made to that in going after extra irrigation water. These winegrowers are going to be on their knees. They are going to be what the government will call 'willing sellers', but they are not really willing at all. They will be forced to sell to the government through desperation. I have said in this place so many time since I was elected that, when you take that water away from these communities, what was once grown is no longer grown and there's a massive drop in production. It could be production of wine grapes but it could be production of something else.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These communities rely on that irrigation water in order to be able to sustain themselves—the schools, the community facilities and the families who have lived there for generations. I am really worried about what happens when the government comes in and says, 'You're on your knees; sell us your water,' instead of going in and saying: 'The wine grape industry is going through a really difficult time. We want you to keep your water and we're going to help you to diversify into another industry.' If you do that then the community stays, the schools stay, the people stay, the employment stays and new crop and new industries are developed. I think a government with a long-term view of the future and that really cares about regional communities would do that. It would go in and say: 'Your industry, not through your fault, is really struggling at the moment due to a global oversupply. We are going to help you diversify.' What I worry about with this government is that it will say, 'You're on your knees; sell us your water,' and basically that will mean communities have a massive reduction in population and everyone goes to Adelaide or Melbourne looking for a job. That's not the Australia that I want to see. I want to see a government supporting Australian regional communities to weather these really difficult agricultural shocks.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">
                  </span>It has been discussed that trade can improve the situation for the wine industry. Whilst that's true to an extent—and I commend the previous government on the free trade agreement negotiations—I don't think we can trade our way out of this. There's been a lot made of the relationship with the Chinese, but their wine consumption was declining anyway. I really think that the government needs to have a strategic approach. It needs to make sure it focuses on helping these communities, not trying to close them down.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms COKER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Corangamite</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:50</span>):  The wine industry, we all acknowledge, is important to Australia and to my region. It's a source of significant exports, with a total value of $1.9 billion in 2023 alone. The industry also delivers local jobs, substantial tourism visitation and diverse business opportunities and contributes to regional prosperity. In my region I have more than 60 quality wine producers. Most are estate grown, and many rely on exports to support their profit margin, so it is pleasing to note China's interim decision to lift tariffs on Australian wine imports.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government continues to pursue free trade agreements and other things to promote our wines and increase our exports to the world. We want to support greater demand for Australian wine. We're delivering a free trade agreement with the UK, eliminating all tariffs on Australian wine, and we're also securing a trade agreement with India, significantly lowering tariffs and establishing a joint dialogue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Domestically, a range of supports remain available for wine growers who are doing it tough. We have the Farm Household Allowance Program, which is available to farmers and their partners in financial hardship. This program has already provided over $800 million in payments to farmers and producers, including fortnightly payments and additional allowances such as rent assistance, case support and farm financial assessment. The program also includes a $10,000 activity supplement to develop skills and increase capacity for financial self-reliance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Moreover, the Regional Investment Corporation delivers the government's concessional loans to the farming sector, offering low-cost, low-interest loans. Farmers and farm-related small businesses meeting eligibility and lending criteria can apply for loans of up to $2 million for farmers and up to $500,000 for farm-related small businesses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm also pleased that agriculture ministers from all levels of government have agreed to establish a viticulture and wine sector working group. This group is important because it shows that all levels of government recognise the significant challenges facing our wine grape growers, particularly in the inland regions. The working group will include industry experts from Wine Australia, Australian Grape &amp; Wine and other industry experts and will provide recommendations to the federal and state agriculture ministers to address the challenges facing our growers. The working group will visit regions most impacted by the oversupply, including the Riverland in South Australia and the Riverina in New South Wales, and will report back to agriculture ministers by the end of April 2024. I would urge the working group to also come to Corangamite and hear from our local wine producers. The government will continue to work closely with industry, state governments and Wine Australia to monitor the situation and ensure growers have the tools, support and information they need to make decisions about their future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Additionally, the Agricultural Trade and Market Access Cooperation Program assists the Australian wine industry to build long-term, sustainable demand. The program has provided over $3.3 million through three grants to Australian Grape &amp; Wine and over $1.1 million through two grants to the Australian Food and Wine Collaboration Group, which includes Wine Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, I acknowledge there are challenges facing our wine sector, including changes to consumer preferences and global economic pressures. I look forward to the working group's findings, and I look forward to lobbying to ensure that we can do more for our wine growers. They are important, and they create jobs and financial benefits for our regions, just like mine in Corangamite. We are taking action and we are enhancing opportunities for the export of wine. We're supporting local producers with a range of financial support programs, and we're working with other nations to deliver fair trade agreements that enable greater exports and to develop new markets across the globe. We must do this because we have amazing Australian wine and we need to encourage our winemakers to stick with it. We are supporting them in every way possible.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mallee</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:55</span>):  I rise today with a sense of urgency to speak to the member for Barker's motion and to address the pressing challenges facing our highly valued wine grape growers in my electorate of Mallee. Our wine grape industry is in crisis, and it is imperative that our growers are supported to ensure the sustainability of our regional communities. The Mallee is bearing the brunt of a structural imbalance in wine grape supply and demand.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Murray Valley Winegrowers harvest report showed that independent growers were collectively paid 40 per cent less than they were in 2022. This equates to an average loss of income of $122,000 for each of the 300 wine growers in the region—well down from the $245,000 gross income during 2021. When you consider that some wineries offer growers as little as $120 a tonne and that production costs are about $300 a tonne, despite what on face value looks like a large gross income, many growers are left running at a severe loss. In Sunraysia, in the broader Murray Valley wine grape region, the Murray Valley Winegrowers chair, Chris Dent, said recently, 'We are such a powerhouse for the whole industry, regularly producing around 70 per cent of the national crush.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Furthermore, the looming threats of forced exits, water buybacks and widespread vineyard abandonment pose not only economic risks but also significant biosecurity hazards and mental health consequences for farmers. I echo the sentiments of the Leader of the Nationals, David Littleproud, who rightly emphasises the need for fairness in the marketplace and to ensure that our farmers are not left to bear the burden alone. The proposed code of conduct for those that buy produce from Australian farmers is a step in the right direction, offering much-needed transparency and protection for our primary producers. In many cases, growers are not getting paid for as long as six months, highlighting the shortcomings of industry self-regulation in this instance of concentrated market power.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese Labor government must safeguard the future of our horticultural industry and the families that underpin it. In the Mallee, our wine growers are facing unprecedented challenges exacerbated by Labor's industry-killing water buybacks and the recent wine grape oversupply. These pressures have pushed our already struggling industry to tipping point, and Labor is standing idly by while our farmers and farming communities suffer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In contrast, the coalition stands shoulder to shoulder with our rural communities. The coalition's Wine Tourism and Cellar Door Grants initiative gave wine grape growers practical support, and more than $760,000 was granted to 15 wine operations in the Mallee alone. This strategic support not only provided the necessary funds for growers to improve their cellar door offerings, but the grants improved the visibility and reputation of Mallee's wine production on a national and international scale. For regional Australians, an election cannot come soon enough. The coalition will address Labor's appalling ambivalence to our primary industries and farmers in particular. I'm proud to say the Nationals dragged a reluctant Albanese Labor government to hold an ACCC inquiry into the supermarket sector, and already the evidence coming forward demonstrates the need for reform.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What's Labor's solution for our farmers? Tax them more. The biosecurity levy before the parliament will hit these struggling wine grape growers with more of the cost of handling the biosecurity threat brought by foreign competitors sending their product into our country. The Nationals have pushed for a container levy to fund biosecurity, imposing the cost where the threat actually emerges, but, no, Labor wants to hit Aussie farmers for 10 per cent more than their 2020-21 levy contributions, kicking them while they're down. Unlike Labor, the coalition highly values the immense generational contributions of our wine growers to the cultural, economic and social fabric of regional Australia. Their resilience and hard work embody the spirit of our community, and it's our duty to stand by them in their time of need. I call upon the government to heed the voices of our wine growers and take decisive action to support the sustainability and prosperity of our industry.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr REPACHOLI</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hunter</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:00</span>):  I want to talk about Australia's amazing wine industry. It's a big deal globally, and it shows how dedicated and tough Aussies are. Australia is the fifth-biggest wine producer in the world, making some of the best wines ever tasted, and the Hunter Valley is a major contributor to that. Our wines are enjoyed everywhere, thanks to the hard work of over 160,000 people in this industry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While we revel in our success, we must also confront the challenges that have beset us in recent years. It hasn't all been smooth sailing. We've been facing some really tough times lately. Our wine exports have dropped, and grape prices have fallen sharply. The total value of Australian wine exports declined by 2.4 per cent to $1.9 billion in the year to December 2023. But the 2023 figures tell only part of the recent story, with exports down one-third compared to 2021. The average red grape prices have dropped below the cost of production, from $650 per tonne in 2020 to $277 per tonne in 2023.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Changes in what people want and trade problems have made things tricky. The decline in Australian wine exports, coupled with the plummeting grape prices, paints a sobering picture. Trade disruptions and shifting consumer preferences have reshaped the landscape of our industry, demanding adaptability and innovation from all stakeholders. When they stopped, our exports to China were worth over $1.1 billion each and every year, and it was an industry that was growing in terms of the export potential. This week we have an interim decision which says that the wine industry will again be able to export to China freely. That will make an enormous difference for jobs, particularly in the Hunter.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that some of the wineries are under real pressure, yet, in the face of this adversity, the Australian government remains steadfast in its commitment to support our wine industry, through initiatives like the Agriculture Trade and Market Access Cooperation, ATMAC, program, which strives to cultivate long-term sustainable demand for Australian wine. We provide more than $3.3 million, through three grants, to Australian Grape and Wine, and more than $1.1 million, through two grants, to the Australian Food and Wine Collaboration Group, which includes Wine Australia. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The idea is to create a long-lasting demand for Australian wine by selling it to more places and making better trade deals. We are continuing to pursue ambitious free trade agreements and support greater demand for Australian wine. In May we entered into a free trade agreement with the UK which eliminated all tariffs on Australian wine. In 2022 we entered into a trade agreement with India which lowered tariffs significantly and established a joint dialogue, and we are currently negotiating a more comprehensive agreement with India.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">But we are not just helping on the global stage; we are also supporting our own grape growers who are struggling financially. Programs like the Rural Financial Counselling Service offer help and advice to farmers and small businesses in trouble. Rural financial counsellors are qualified professionals who can provide support that is unique to a primary producer's situation, at no cost to the client. There are also special payments and loans to help them through tough times. Programs such as the farm household allowance and concessional loans from the Regional Investment Corporation provide essential lifelines to those facing economic hardship. The program has already provided over $800 million in payments to farmers and producers, including fortnightly payments and additional allowances, such as rent assistance, case support and farm financial assessments.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm particularly heartened by the collaborative efforts of all levels of government and industry stakeholders in establishing the viticulture and wine sector working group. This initiative underscores our collective commitment to address the challenges confronting wine grapegrowers, especially in inland regions such as the Riverland and Riverina. Through collaboration and cooperation we endeavour to devise effective solutions and chart a course towards a brighter future for our industry. There are challenges the sector continues to face, but it can be confident that the Albanese Labor government is working closely with the industry, state governments and Wine Australia to monitor the situation and ensure that growers have their rights—the right tools, support and information they need to make decisions about their future.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="300147" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr VIOLI</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Casey</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:05</span>):  Firstly, I want to commend the member for Barker, not just for this motion but for his passion and advocacy on this issue. We can't overstate this: this is a crisis. When we listen to those opposite, it feels like that meme of someone sitting in a house when the house is burning and they say, 'Oh, everything's fine.' This is a crisis, and let's be really clear and understand that it's not just because of the tariff that China put on Australia. That's not the core issue at play here. When that tariff went on in 2020, France, Chile, Italy and Spain all saw declines in their sales to China. The Australian market stopped overnight and those four significant countries also lost sales. This is the structural challenge that the member for Barker has been talking about, and it needs a significant response. But we're not seeing a significant response from this government. That's the frustration for those on this side and for those in Barker in the Riverland who need support.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my community of Casey we have the Yarra Valley, which is a strong wine-making region. In the 12 months to December of 2019 our exports were 1.4 million litres—about $25 million in value. China represented about $16½ million of that. In the 12 months to December of 2023, Yarra Valley exports were at 360,000 litres and $8½ million in value. In our community, we're fortunate; as the member for Barker knows, we're at the higher-end premium market. We've been impacted, but not as much as many others in the community. This is the frustration for growers and farmers. In this time of crisis the minister for agriculture won't go and visit communities and understand the challenges that they face. He won't visit and see firsthand the impact and the devastation for the families and generational businesses in crisis. He won't have the decency to visit them and at least offer some moral support if he isn't going to offer any financial support.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At a time when our industries are struggling and on their knees, there's another decision by this government that defies belief and defies common sense: the Export Market Development Grant program will not be delivered for the wine industry in the financial year 2024-25. This grant is for individual businesses and representative bodies to drive export market development. This is a time when they need it more than ever. It's crucial for the industry. They're on their knees and this government is pulling a crucial program to deliver exports. I spoke recently with Wine Yarra Valley CEO Caroline Evans, who, along with Barossa Australia, McLaren Vale Wine and Tourism Association, the Margaret River Wine group and the Adelaide wine region, wrote to the Minister for Trade, the Hon. Don Farrell, about reinstating the program. They had an opportunity to meet with his office recently, and they were told, 'Too sad, too bad, bad luck.' There will be no program this financial year, for 2024-25. If they're lucky, the government might announce a new program in mid to late this year for the next financial year, 2025-26.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've talked about the challenges with China. The positive is that those tariffs are hopefully coming off. So, at a time when a market is opening to give a little bit of a hope, those development grants—that money—is crucial to re-entering that market. I've worked in exports before. It's not like the tariffs come off and tomorrow you walk back into Shanghai or Beijing and the sales are there. You've got to set up networks. You've got to re-advertise. You have to invest. This government is pulling export investments from an industry right when they need that money to invest. China is declining, as I've already said, but it's still a big market and it's better than nothing. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an example of this government not understanding agriculture and not understanding industry or exports. Our industry is in trouble. It needs support. It's not getting support. It's worse than that; this government is making their job even harder. The industry has been abandoned, and it is unacceptable. It's time for the minister to step up. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sleep is often an afterthought for many Australians. Despite our supposedly laid-back lifestyle, we often find ourselves on the go and pressed for time every day, and no more so than in this parliament. As a result, our sleep suffers, as does our overall health. As a parent, a grandparent, a paediatrician and a politician I've seen firsthand how a lack of sleep affects those around me, including me and my family. As a paediatrician I've often sat in my office and heard from rather hollow-eyed parents about the sleep of their newborn or their toddler and how it's affecting them, their families and their health.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Inadequate sleep and sleep disorders can have serious health complications. It can lead to conditions such as cardiovascular disease, hypertension, diabetes, cognitive decline and deterioration, and other health conditions such as multiple sclerosis. With health issues, prevention is the answer, and it should be the key focus of how we deal with sleep issues. This is particularly important for my electorate of Macarthur, as we have many individuals working in roles that have shiftwork, that have overnight or late-hour shifts, such as in emergency services, public transport services and the logistics industries. Even in my own industry of health we've seen how people can be affected by long shifts, poor sleep and having to deal with family life as well as the long working hours. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I firmly believe also that every member of this House would acknowledge the importance of sleep. I don't know how many of our colleagues have come to see me about their poor sleep and the difficulty they're having coping with the workload of a parliamentarian or a staffer. My good friend the member for Fremantle, Josh Wilson, and his staff travel from Western Australia each sitting week and need to adjust their own body clocks every sitting week to deal with the long travel time and the lifestyle of a parliamentarian and parliamentary staff.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd also like to thank the member for Fremantle for seconding this motion. Together we are rather minor celebrities—although he is much more of a celebrity than me—as we feature in this Wednesday's episode of the SBS documentary <span style="font-style:italic;">Australia's sleep revolution with Dr Michael Mosley</span>. We've had our sleep study, alongside those of the member for New England and Senator Jacqui Lambie, and we got some surprises. I can say that I'm not the least healthy member of that quartet, but I didn't do well, much to my surprise.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was proud to serve as the deputy chair of the Standing Committee on Health, Aged Care and Sport in the last parliament, and I'm proud to now serve as chair of the committee. In the previous parliament, it was alongside my friend the former member for North Sydney and then chair of the committee Trent Zimmerman that we produced the report on our inquiry into sleep health awareness in Australia. We found that almost four in every 10 Australians were not having enough quality sleep, which comes at an obvious cost to the country and to the economy but also to the individual's health. There was also a Deloitte report from 2016 with the finding that, during that period, the Australian economy lost $66 billion due to inadequate sleep.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our report, which was appropriately entitled <span style="font-style:italic;">Bedtime reading</span>, contained 11 recommendations that sought to address the impact of poor sleep hygiene and inadequate sleep on the Australian community. Our recommendations were: better recognition of sleep health as a priority health and wellbeing issue; revised guidelines and processes for addressing inadequate sleep; and a review of available sleep health services and therapies in Australia, including eligibility requirements for these services and mechanisms by which they are funded. We also suggested the listing of supporting medication for sleep disorders under the orphan drug program, including medications for things like narcolepsy. We suggested changes to sleep health education and training for GPs and specialists and an increased focus on research into sleep health and sleep disorders through the Medical Research Future Fund and the NHMRC.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to also thank the previous Minister for Health and Aged Care, Greg Hunt, for working with us and supporting our inquiry, and also the present Minister for Health and Aged Care, the Hon. Mark Butler, for his work in recognising the importance of how good-quality sleep can reduce the risk of chronic diseases. Importantly, our government is supporting the wideranging scope of the inquiry recommendations and is supportive of work already underway. We support further measures to make sure that funding is put in place for this.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms WARE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hughes</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:16</span>):  I rise to speak in favour of this motion brought by the member for Macarthur, and I thank the honourable member for bringing this important issue about sleep health to the parliament. Overall, I thank the member for all of the work that he does as Chair of the Standing Committee on Health, Aged Care and Sport, where I am privileged to serve with him.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sleep health should be recognised for its importance in preventive health and wellbeing alongside other things such as fitness and nutrition. Studies have shown that it is just as important. Approximately one in five Australians are estimated to be affected by major sleep disorders, and these can include obstructive sleep apnoea, insomnia, restless leg syndrome, circadian rhythm disorders and central disorders of excessive sleepiness. Anyone who unfortunately, like me, wakes regularly at one o'clock or two o'clock in the morning, tosses and turns and then tries to function the next day knows the importance of the role that sleep plays in our being able to carry out and live our very busy lives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As well as the immediate effects of fatigue, sleep disorders may also contribute to other health conditions, and these can include diabetes, obesity, mental ill health and cardiovascular disease. Other causes of sleep deprivation include work-life challenges, excessive screen time and poor mental health. It is essential to promote sleep as a foundation of ensuring positive health and wellbeing outcomes in combination with good nutrition and healthy exercise.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I do note that the House Standing Committee on Health, Aged Care and Sport in 2019 was tasked with inquiring into and reporting on sleep health awareness in Australia. Particularly, the committee looked at five main areas: the potential and known causes, impacts and costs of inadequate sleep and sleep disorders on the community; the access to support and treatment available for individuals experiencing inadequate sleep; education, training and professional development available to healthcare workers in the diagnosis, treatment and management of individuals experiencing inadequate sleep and health disorders; workplace awareness, practices and assistance available to those who may be impacted by inadequate sleep or sleep disorders, particularly focusing on rostering practices for shiftworkers, for example; and, finally, current national research and investment into sleep health and sleeping disorders. The final report made 11 recommendations to the Australian government in relation to national health priorities, guidelines for workplaces, the MBS, the orphan drug program, market competition, research, the role of GPs and specialist treatments, and community awareness, particularly among vulnerable groups.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Overwhelmingly, though, the committee recommended that the government prioritise sleep health as a national priority and recognise its importance to health and wellbeing hand in hand with fitness and nutrition. I am pleased to say that the government responded in August 2023 and has adopted in principle or in full most of those recommendations. I commend the minister for that decision.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When in government, the coalition introduced the National Preventive Health Strategy, which aimed to provide more balance to the health system by enhancing the focus on prevention. It's very pleasing that the current government has continued with this strategy which recognises that sleep predominantly, alongside nutrition and physical activity, is essential to preventing poor physical health and wellbeing. The length and quality of sleep over the life course are also recognised as protective factors contributing to positive mental health and wellbeing throughout life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When we have evidence that indicates that developing and maintaining good sleep habits can support positive health outcomes, particularly where those habits are established at an early stage of the life course, I commend both this motion and the actions of the government and the previous standing committee on health for bringing this important matter to the parliament.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="265970" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr JOSH WILSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fremantle</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:21</span>):  It's always good to be reminded that some of the most powerful contributions to health and wellbeing happen to be relatively basic and accessible elements of day-to-day life—what we eat, what we do with exercise and how we sleep. But perhaps that third element doesn't get the attention it deserves, and I'm glad to be part of this motion with the members for Macarthur and Hughes to try to change that to a small degree.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's certainly evidence that too many Australians sleep badly and that too many of us are taking poor sleep for granted, or, at least, feeling like there's no real alternative other than to put up with something we assume can't be fixed. That's wrong, and it's consigning millions of Australians to unnecessary and sometimes quite serious impacts on their physical and mental health with broader consequences for productivity and health system costs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2019, the Standing Committee on Health, Aged Care and Sport tabled a report titled <span style="font-style:italic;">B</span><span style="font-style:italic;">edtime </span><span style="font-style:italic;">reading</span><span style="font-style:italic;">: </span><span style="font-style:italic;">inquiry </span><span style="font-style:italic;">into </span><span style="font-style:italic;">sleep health awa</span><span style="font-style:italic;">reness in Australia</span>, which the member for Macarthur played a key role in. It pointed to the fact that four in 10 Australians report at least one sleep related problem; that up to half of 16- to 17-year-olds are not getting enough sleep on school nights; and that one in five adults are diagnosed with a sleep disorder, if you combine obstructive sleep apnoea, restless leg syndrome and insomnia. And that's pretty rough. I know people in my family and among my friends who contribute to those statistics.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Beyond the personal impact, Deloitte has assessed the economywide financial costs of inadequate sleep as comprising $1.8 billion in health system costs and $17.9 billion in lost productivity. If you look at it the other way around, the benefits of good sleep are almost impossible to overstate. In the <span style="font-style:italic;">B</span><span style="font-style:italic;">edtime </span><span style="font-style:italic;">r</span><span style="font-style:italic;">eading</span> report, Professor Matthew Walker stated:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… there does not seem to be one major organ in the body, or process within the brain that is not optimally enhanced by sleep (and detrimentally impaired when we do not get enough).</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm grateful to the member for Macarthur for bringing the motion and for his work on this issue over a number of years. The motion, to some degree, has been prompted by our shared participation in the SBS series <span style="font-style:italic;">Australia's </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Sl</span><span style="font-style:italic;">eep </span><span style="font-style:italic;">R</span><span style="font-style:italic;">evolution with Dr Michael Mosley</span> and the excellent people from Flinders University in South Australia. The final episode runs this Wednesday. I'm not going to suggest that it will help you go to sleep; I think it's actually reasonably exciting. I wholeheartedly endorse the message and mission that lie at the core of the series—namely, that we need to wake up, hopefully, after eight peaceful hours, to the vital importance of sleep and that we need to ensure that identifying and remediating poor sleep is a core purpose of primary health care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I've said, the three-part series concludes on Wednesday. Some of the people in it include four federal parliamentarians: myself, the members for Macarthur and New England and Senator Lambie. I am definitely the least interesting of that quartet! They focused on us because we all live professional lives that involve frequent travel and a range of other challenges that can impact on the ability to get good sleep but also because we have a role in the national health policy conversation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm lucky to be a relatively good sleeper, and that's probably why I don't feature too much in the documentary. The truth is that I've always recognised a central value of sleep to my broader sense of wellbeing. That's why I prioritise getting enough sleep as much as I can. That's why I make choices in order to give myself the best chance of sleeping well, especially as I travel across Australia something like 20 times a year, back and forth from east to west, and constantly manage a two- to three-hour time difference.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But no-one who experiences seriously poor sleep should blame themselves. Most importantly, no-one should fall into the trap of believing that there's nothing that can be done in order to sleep better. People should talk to their GP. People should check out the information that's available through the Sleep Health Foundation or the 'sleep' page of the Healthdirect website. We all deserve to get better sleep. We shouldn't just take it for granted.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government, through the work of Minister Mark Butler, is focused on improving the scope, quality, access and affordability of our public health system at every turn, because we know that Medicare, the PBS, our public hospitals and the new Medicare urgent care clinics are the foundation of our shared wellbeing. When it comes to sleep, the National Preventive Health Strategy will continue to focus on raising awareness of the disorders that contribute to fatigue, high blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes and poor mental health while looking at new ways to support healthy sleeping.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to finish by thanking the team behind the making of <span style="font-style:italic;">Australia's Sleep Revolution</span>, including Artemis Media, a brilliant factual filmmaker in my electorate of Fremantle that was involved in the series. On a completely trivial note, after two weeks of quite bizarre testing and high-tech sleep scrutiny, I was able to come away with a document that states officially that I don't snore, which I consider a big win—that document is very precious to me! Thanks again for having this debate.</span>
