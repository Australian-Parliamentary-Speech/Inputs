We are very disappointed with that given that I have indicated to all our colleagues on this side that it would be held at that time. Now people have other commitments, things are scheduled and it's very difficult to pull people out of other issues at 11.45, when there was an agreement we would have it immediately after prayers.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:33</span>):  [by video link] The arts and the humanities are amazing, and anyone who studies them should be celebrated. We know that the future of employment in this country, the industries that are needed over the next 25 years, the challenges we face as a community are all better faced when people have the opportunity to study in the arts, in the humanities, gaining the skills that are available to people there. I say that proudly as somebody that studied the arts when I was at university myself.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is also the case that many previous generations to my own have had the opportunity to study in these fields either at a dramatically reduced cost or, indeed, for free. There is an entire generation of so-called legislators in this place who went to university for free, who studied the arts and the humanities for free. There are no fewer than 16 government members that went to university for free. The education minister himself has no fewer than three arts degrees, so you would think in that context that any and all legislation that came before this place would be aimed at opening up opportunity for young people, for students across the country to study at university, and would encourage people to study in these incredibly vital fields where we have the opportunity to explore the deepest questions of our own human nature and collaborate with each other on some of the most challenging topics of our time. Particularly in this moment where so many young people are challenged as never before by the reality of the COVID recession, by the reality of the climate crisis and by the reality of the health crisis, you would imagine that any and all legislation put before this place would be aimed at making it easier for us as young people to get an education. Particularly now, more than ever, in 2020, getting a tertiary degree, studying in these fields, is the modern equivalent of exiting high school as it was for previous generations. Yet, when we look at the Higher Education Support Amendment (Job-Ready Graduates and Supporting Regional and Remote Students) Bill 2020, when we open the lid and look at this proposal, we see the diametric opposite.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the heart of this bill is a rank hypocrisy. It is the legislative embodiment of a pattern which is sweeping through our entire society at the moment, and that is the pattern of older, privileged folks denying to this generation, to my generation, the opportunities which they themselves enjoyed. An entire generation of parliamentarians who went to university for free are now moving to block that opportunity—not only to fail to pass on that opportunity but to make it more difficult for students to study in the arts and humanities. It is one of the most unfair and one of the most hypocritical pieces of legislation that we have seen in recent times.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We all know that the major parties in this place operate in a relatively fact-free environment—a fantasy land, if you like—where gas is a clean pathway to the renewable energy future and tax cuts for the rich magically trickle down and help everybody else. That's nothing new, but it is worth noting that there is not one speck of academic evidence from any part of the field that will tell you that making arts and humanities more difficult to study is the right thing to do at this present moment. In fact, the opposite is true. I had the opportunity to serve on the future of work and workers committee as one of my first tasks as an MP, and what we heard very clearly as a committee was that the next 25 years of work in this country will primarily evolve around the human-facing industries, those care industries in aged care and in the NDIS. These are the spaces and places where the trends of automation are least likely to take greatest effect, because of the vital need for there to be humans in those roles. These are all things that are better supported by access to the arts and humanities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me say it again just so that we are very clear: this bill is a hypocritical act. It denies to my generation, to the young people of this country, the opportunities which were enjoyed by the previous generations. It is being perpetrated upon students by a government containing 16 members who themselves went to university for free and by a minister who himself benefited from arts and humanities work at university.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">During the course of this campaign, as we have opposed this legislation, thousands of students have reached out to us as a party and shared with us, as Greens MPs, their frustration and anger at the double standard that is represented in this legislation. Whether it be on climate, whether it be on employment or whether it be in education, the simple ask of young people in Australia is that we not have put in our way barriers that were torn down for previous generations. That is what this bill does, and it is not okay. Increasing the cost of an arts and humanities degree by 113 per cent is not okay. It is not acceptable, particularly not at this moment in time. We have young people at universities all around the country struggling with mental health, in a context where the university sector has been critically underfunded for decades and where staff are facing chronic work insecurity, yet we as students are being asked to pay more to participate in this system. We have put ourselves forward to pursue our hopes and dreams, to work with each other, to do the best that we can, and the answer that this government has given us is: pay double and get on with it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The sickening truth at the centre of this legislation is that it is being done for purely ideological reasons by a government that simply hates the arts and humanities, that has never appreciated the social sciences; in fact, it interprets these fields of study as directly oppositional to its cruel agendas. Whether it was Howard's attacks on the student union movement or the multibillion dollar cuts levelled against the higher education sector by the Labor government, for decades it has been bipartisan policy for both sides of politics to come together to either rip funding out of higher education, making it more difficult to access, or decrease the political power of students.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am incredibly proud to sit virtually with my Greens colleagues today in opposing this legislation as a member of a political movement that proclaims clearly that university—that education—is a human right and a public good and should be free for all forever. I oppose this bill, along with my colleagues, and will vote against it with pride. I thank the chamber for its time.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:44</span>):  I rise to speak on the Higher Education Support Amendment (Job-Ready Graduates and Supporting Regional and Remote Students) Bill 2020. The bill is the coalition's latest attempt to deteriorate and attack our higher education system. They want to make it one characterised by high levels of private debt and unequal access. Labor cannot support this legislation. The government states the purpose of the reform is to provide additional university places and to redirect universities' enrolments to areas of study linked to jobs in demand in the labour market. But what this bill really does is strip another $1 billion of government funds out of the university sector and more than double the cost of many courses—in particular, arts and humanities—and make it more difficult for many students to go to university, all under the guise of reform.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The additional $1 billion announced last night doesn't even make up for what universities have lost this year, let alone the conservative and consistent cuts that we've seen over the seven years of this Liberal government. The fundamental effect of the bill is to make Australian students pay more for the cost of their education while the Commonwealth pays less. Under this legislation, the overall student contribution will increase by seven per cent, and 40 per cent of students will have their fees increased. Yes, 40 per cent of all students will have their fees increased, with some degrees rising by 113 per cent. I know it's hard to believe—yes, a 113 per cent increase. Those studying commerce, humanities, communications, economics and law will now pay more than a dentist or doctor for the cost of their degree.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The effect of this fee rise will be felt over decades to come. Doubling the size of students' university debt will influence their ability to save for a home, which will undermine their long-term economic security. Younger people are already worse off and will fare far worse from the COVID-19 Morrison recession. Instead of encouraging our younger generation to gain essential skills to drive our recovery, the Morrison government will make them pay more. How does that make sense? This is not a new attempt. Since taking office in 2013, the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison governments have repeatedly tried to increase the share of higher education funding paid by students and reduce the Commonwealth's own contribution. Labor always has and always will oppose these cuts. We successfully opposed two previous attempts to do this in 2014 and in 2017. We'll endeavour to block this present bill's passage through parliament, although we know crossbench senators have taken 40 silver shillings and sold out Australian students.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-GeneralInterjecting">A government senator:</span>  Point of order, Madam Deputy President. I must rise on the reflection on crossbench colleagues. I think the reference to the silver coins being taken by them to induce how they vote is perhaps a rhetorical flourish that the senator might like to withdraw.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator POLLEY:</span>
                    </a>  Thank you, Madam Deputy President. You know when you get such an interjection that you're touching a nerve, because what I am saying is a reality of what this bill will do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What is ironic about this bill is that the drop in funding, as I said, will be felt in the areas where we should be encouraging more students to go to university. That's what we should be doing, but this bill is designed to discourage people. In fact, although enrolment is being encouraged in many disciplines by dropping course costs for students, funding going to the university is also dropping. This means that universities will get less money to provide job-ready courses, say experts and commentators. So it's not just people on this side of the chamber; your own former minister for education, Ms Julie Bishop, has described this design as an unreasonable incentive for universities that will likely achieve the opposite of what the government supposedly intends.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What is highly concerning is that the government is trying to redirect support to regional universities, but the associated funding and implementation mechanisms are not specified. It remains unclear how the redirection of funds to regional universities would operate outside of the bill, and whether or not regional universities will be better off. On the contrary, expert analysis suggests that regional universities will be worse off due to the design of the new Commonwealth Grant Scheme arrangements, which are based on average teaching costs. In many regional areas, these costs are generally higher and often do not fit the one-size-fits-all approach, which the Liberal government loves to use—just like they did with the robodebt scheme. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The impact of this crisis on regional universities will be devastating. The bill will make it near impossible for many people in my home state of Tasmania to go onto university and to study without having to obtain a mortgage. Tasmania is already experiencing a skills shortage and a brain drain. The ability to think critically and creatively and to understand how the world operates, skills often learned in a humanities degree, are what employers will be looking for into the future. We cannot discount these skills and we should not discount these skills. We should not discourage people from going to university to study the courses they're passionate about by burdening them with a huge debt. Regardless, humanity graduates are just as likely as science graduates to receive a job in their chosen field in Tasmania. With no real jobs plan in place by this government, they should not—as I said on a number of occasions—discourage young people or people who have been forced to go back to university from increasing their skills or gaining the skills that they need to go into the workforce. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We saw with the government's budget on Tuesday evening that they've done nothing for older workers—nothing at all. Older workers who are losing their jobs because of the Morrison recession and the COVID-19 effects have been attacked by this very bill as well, because it will discourage older Australians from going back to university or from going to university for the first time. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government claims an additional 39,000 places will be created in the first three years of this scheme, accumulating to 100,000 over 10 years. However, there is nothing in the government's bill that guarantees any increase in student places. This is the reality. The only thing this bill does is assure that universities will receive less funding for the places they currently provide. There is nothing in the reforms for increased demands due to the recession and closed international borders. In effect, universities will be getting less and will be expected to do more. Even if the government's claims are to be accepted, the additional places that are being proposed are not enough to meet the projected increases in student demand. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As well as this, the pricing model that underpins this bill is weak. The report that the government is basing this legislation on was conducted by Deloitte Access Economics, and it cautioned against making judgements regarding the adequacy of funding from these results. This report was commissioned by this government. Their own Deloitte Access Economics report has warned them that the path they're going down is wrong. This modelling made unrealistic assumptions and did not consult with faculties or STEM members. How could you introduce such a bill without consultation with those people who are on the front line? There is a close relationship between the ability to conduct research and the quality of undergraduate teaching. By undermining this relationship, the Morrison government will have the opposite effect to that which they supposedly are working towards. This bill will impede our economic recovery. The government has actively denied the parliament and the public adequate time and information to fully debate and interrogate this bill. It is clear to Labor that the government is attempting to avoid further evidence of the bill's unfairness, irrationality and poor design coming to light.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill comes at a particularly difficult time for year 12 students, who have just completed their final year of study in extremely uncertain times and under extremely uncertain conditions. They have watched the jobs market collapse and they will be worse off for it, with subdued employment for some time to come. They have also seen apprenticeship opportunities vanish around the economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Universities are already reeling from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic. This sector is particularly hard hit because of the loss of full-fee-paying international students. The consequences of the decline in international student fee revenue has been estimated to result in a loss of income available to support research by up to $7.6 billion over the next five years. That will mean a reduction in the research workforce of 11 per cent—up to 6,000 jobs. Yet there's no plan for this in Frydenberg's budget. Experts have warned that, without the same level of discretionary funding available for the next few years, there is likely to be a significant loss of research momentum in Australian universities. As for university staff—and we've seen it already in Tasmania—the federal government has gone out of its way to exclude public universities from JobKeeper payments. It has changed the rules three times to ensure university staff don't qualify. There have already been 12,000 job losses; we cannot afford to lose any more.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now isn't the time to withdraw further support from our education system and to impose a flawed policy which stakeholders, experts and even previous Liberal Party members do not endorse. We're relying on our brilliant universities and their research to find a vaccine for COVID-19, but they can't rely on the Morrison government to protect their jobs. We are in the deepest and darkest recession in almost a century and the decisions made by the Morrison government are taking it further and making it worse for all Australians. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to incentivise our young people to retrain and reskill. We need to incentivise, retrain and reskill older Australian workers—of such importance for my home state of Tasmania. Therefore I'll be voting, as other Labor senators will be, against this very flawed bill and the attack on our universities, and particularly my university in Tasmania.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SCARR</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:57</span>):  I rise to speak in favour of this bill, the Higher Education Support Amendment (Job-Ready Graduates and Supporting Regional and Remote Students) Bill 2020, as a member of a party which has a proud tradition of supporting higher education in this country. When Sir Robert Gordon Menzies became Prime Minister in 1936, there were only six universities in Australia. There were 14,236 higher education students out of a total population of seven million. When Sir Robert Gordon Menzies retired from the position of Prime Minister, this country had 16 universities and there were 91,272 higher education students. We went from 14,000 to 91,000 students and from six to 16 universities—an incredibly proud tradition that the Liberal Party has in supporting higher education in this country. Higher education in this country did not start with Gough Whitlam, whatever those opposite would like to tell us.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of what a university should be, again I go back to the words of the founder of my party, Sir Robert Gordon Menzies. In a speech he gave in 1939, on his first day as Prime Minister, he talked about the importance of the university: 'What are we to look for in a true university? What causes should it serve?' He put forward seven answers in response:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The university must be a place of pure culture and learning, a training school for the professions, a liaison between the academician and the 'good practical man', the home of research, a trainer of character, a training ground for leaders, and a custodian of the unfettered search for truth.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That last phrase, 'the unfettered search for truth', is one that has stuck with me over quite some period of time. When I look at universities today, I call upon all of our universities to reflect on that Menzies statement that includes an aspiration to 'an unfettered search for truth', because our universities should not be fettered by codes of conduct which do not promote freedom of speech, but trample on it. Our universities should be unfettered by practices of banning speakers from campuses just because they're unpopular and just because certain radicals on the campuses do not wish to permit them to speak. Our universities should be unfettered from fetters imposed by foreign countries and jurisdictions upon what they can teach and how they teach it. Our universities need to aspire to an unfettered search for truth. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second introductory point I'd like to make in relation to this legislation is with respect to the contribution by Senator Jordon Steele-John. I always listen carefully to the good senator from Western Australia. I'm a great admirer of his passion and his ability to put his thoughts into words, but there is no such thing as free education. There is no such thing as free health care. Nothing is free in this world. Someone has to pay. There is no such thing as a free lunch. The first question is: how are we going to pay for it? Who pays what and when? Those are the only questions. Nothing is free in this world, and it is wrong to state to the contrary that something can, in some way, be free and no-one bears the cost. That's a utopian vision which does not reflect reality. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At this time of record budget deficits to help every person in this country, we need to reflect on the fact that every single dollar is absolutely vital and of so much value as we move through this pandemic and rebuild the economy of this country while providing hundreds of thousands of Australians with unemployment benefits. In that context it is entirely reasonable that the government should look at the range of tertiary courses offered, specific units of study within those tertiary courses, and make a practical assessment as to where the government should best direct resources and whether students who desire to study certain courses should meet a greater proportion of the cost of those courses. That is entirely appropriate and practical in this day and age. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will touch on this concept of free education. I understand my friend Senator Rennick talked about how he had a number of part-time jobs when he studied at university. He picked fruit and vegetables and was also a glassie at the Royal Exchange Hotel, which my friend Senator Murray Watt no doubt attended on many occasions. In that context, he contributed to the cost of his education, but Senator Rennick is part of the generation that I belong to as a 50-year-old. HECS was introduced when we were part way through our courses. I had no problem contributing to the cost of my higher education—absolutely no problem at all. I can remember having a discussion with a friend who went into carpentry and building. He said to me, 'Paul, why should I have to pay? Why should I have to pay so you can go to university and then graduate and earn big bucks? You should have to actually pay for your course. You should have to pay for that. Why should I have to pay for that?' I always thought that was an extremely reasonable proposition, because there is no such thing as a free lunch and there is no such thing as free education. Someone has to pay, and the only question is: how do we calibrate that in a modern society?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to turn to a few particular comments in relation to this bill that have been raised, and actually present some facts. Firstly, the coalition government already provides more than $18 billion—that's 'billion' with a B—a year to fund our universities. And this will grow—it's not decreasing, it's actually growing—to $20 billion by 2024, so from $18 billion a year today to $20 billion in 2024. So I think this debate needs to be put in context. I wonder what those opposite would say if we increased it to $21 billion. I think they would complain even more.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another point I'd like to make is, whilst some fields of study will see increases in student contribution amounts for specific units, approximately 60 per cent of students will see either a reduction or no change in their student contribution. Senator Polley, who spoke before me in this debate, wanted to focus on the 40 per cent. What about the 60 per cent?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those students enrolled in teaching, nursing clinical psychology, English and languages will pay 42 per cent less for their degree. We know there is a great need for clinical psychologists at this point in time. I've sat in estimates and heard from the Department of Veterans' Affairs about how our veterans need access to psychological support, and we know that, in the aftermath of the bushfires and of the COVID-19 pandemic, a lot of people are going to need a lot of support. We need more teachers. We need more nurses. We need more English teachers, especially assisting those new Australians to learn English so that they can get better jobs. We need all of those students in those courses, and it's absolutely fit and proper that they should pay less, because our community needs people with those specialties who can do those courses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Students who study agriculture and maths will pay 59 per cent less for their degree. We need more maths teachers. We need more farmers educated in best farming practices who can work on our farms and increase productivity. And it's fit and proper that they should pay 59 per cent less for their degree. Students who study science, health, architecture, environmental science, IT and engineering will pay 18 per cent less for their degree. Again, these are decisions which are informed by what is actually happening in the labour market today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This will certainly not be the most profound thing said in this chamber, but Australia does not need more lawyers. There are plenty of lawyers out there, I can tell you, and there are more people studying law today than there are actual jobs for them. There are more people studying law than there are people practising law. It is fit and proper that this government should give a message to people looking to undertake higher education as to where their best prospects lie. It is absolutely wrong that we should send a message to people that they should be entering into courses to study certain things when their employment prospects are less than if they were studying other courses. It's absolutely appropriate we send this message to them through the market.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know young people who want to study law. I know young people who want to study other humanities subjects where the price may well rise under these reforms. I know those people are out there–and good luck to them, I absolutely support them. And even if they choose to do that, under our Higher Education Loan Program, the HELP system, no student needs to pay anything up-front, and student loans are only repaid when the student is earning over $46,000. So if you want to study law, study law. Good luck to you. Give me a call, and I'll talk to you about the practise of law and how I've seen it develop in the years since I graduated from university in 1991. Absolutely do it. But know the sort of profession you're getting into, how many people are actually practising in that profession today, how that impacts on your job prospects and how it could well be that you might find it easier to secure employment in another field where this country is desperate for more people to study—particularly fields such as teaching, nursing, clinical psychology, English, language et cetera. So be informed. Be informed as to what your prospects are.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If you do choose to study any of the courses that are available to you from any of our wonderful universities, note that a person on the lowest repayment threshold, which starts at 80 per cent of the median earnings for all Australian employees, will pay only $8.80 to $10.20 per week. We're talking about $10.20 a week after you've studied your course, whatever it is, and you've reached that lowest repayment threshold. So you have to start repaying $8.80 to $10.20 per week. Is that too much to ask? Seriously—is that too much to ask? It's quite baffling how those opposite can be so outraged, and one has to query the degree to which this outrage is really confected. I must say I was sitting here yesterday in question time, listening to the questions coming from the opposition in response to the budget, and they really were particularly underwhelming. They couldn't lay a glove on the budget that was brought down on Tuesday night. And now we have this confected outrage—over what? It is over someone who goes to university, doesn't have to pay a cent whilst they're studying, doesn't have to pay any fee whilst they're studying and then, once they reach the lowest repayment threshold, which starts at 80 per cent of the median earnings for all Australian employees, pays only $8.80 to $10.20 per week.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator THORPE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:12</span>):  I'd like to begin by informing the chamber that this is not my first speech. I rise to speak in this long debate on the Higher Education Support Amendment (Job-Ready Graduates and Supporting Regional and Remote Students) Bill 2020. The Greens oppose this bill. 'Nothing is for free,' says Senator Scarr. In that case, maybe we should talk about the stolen land and resources from this country's First People or the free money to your Liberal Party donors in this budget.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It saddens me that in my first week here in the Senate I'm witnessing firsthand the unfair and out-of-touch agenda of this government. This bill, along with this week's federal budget, shows how this government does not care about setting up a smarter, safer, healthier future for this country. They especially don't care about our country's young people. These young people are facing a pandemic, an economic crisis and a climate emergency. Young people in this country just want to have a chance—a chance to get an education if that's how they choose to contribute to their community. Young people just want a chance not to be tied down to decades of debt. Many of my fellow senators in this place and members in the House benefited from free uni education—not just cheap education but free education. It's hypocritical that they are the same people that will apply this bill happily to the next generation of young people and deny the young people of this country the same opportunity. The government, with this package, is pulling up the drawbridge so no-one else gets to come in.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Education is about opportunity. It's about having the chance to get new skills, get qualified and get on the path to a secure and rewarding job. Education is about being able to have an opportunity to go to one of our universities—some of the best in the world—without worrying about being crushed by huge debt that follows you around for decades. Education is the great equaliser. That's why this government wants to make it harder for people to get one.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This package will more than double fees for those students who want to contribute to our society by studying humanities and social sciences. This budget will also slash up to $900 million in funding for teaching and learning; this includes funding for STEM and nursing courses. That's how out of touch this government really is. It will slash nursing, social sciences and science funding in the middle of a global public health crisis. It's shameful.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will punish struggling students; they are already struggling. According to our modelling, for some students it could take up to 20 years to pay off a three-year humanities degree—maybe even longer, because that assumes graduates will go straight into full-time work that pays them a good wage and allows them to put food on their table and a roof over their heads. It doesn't account for any years taken off any full-time work for parental leave, to care for a loved one or for any other personal reason. It also doesn't take into account further study that someone might need to do just to get a foot in the door.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's claim that it will support regional universities with this plan just doesn't stack up. The government's plan will force regional universities to teach more students with less money and force those students to go into huge debt just to get their degree. The consequences for regional communities will be felt hard and for a lifetime.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm concerned that this bill will deepen inequality for Indigenous students in particular. This bill puts up more barriers for our people to go to university, to get a job and to earn a good wage that can support themselves, their families and their communities. Indigenous students are more likely to be loaded up with high HECS debts, because they often choose to study social sciences and community development as a way to give back to their communities. We should be prioritising and rewarding their hard work, not putting up more walls and building more barriers for our young people to get an education in any field they choose.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Education is not just about being a cog in a machine; it's about being able to contribute fully to the society you live in. No person in this place or anywhere should ever make it harder for anyone to go to university—particularly Indigenous young people, who have been locked out of opportunities in their own country for centuries. I've seen so many photos of Indigenous graduates on Twitter—many of them the first in their families to go to university. I encourage all senators to search for the hashtag #BlackfullaGradPics. You'll see photos of our young people graduating as nurses, doctors, social workers, social scientists, surgeons, journalists, therapists, scientists and teachers. All of them make their families, their friends and their ancestors and elders proud, graduating while wearing the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander flags. As we approach graduation season all around the country, we will see even more Indigenous community development workers, counsellors, lawyers and engineers, and I can't wait to share in their happiness. In fact, I can't wait to welcome some of them into this chamber as fellow senators. Everyone here should be making it easier for Indigenous young people—all young people—to get an excellent education at our excellent public universities, and for free. This package does not do that—far from it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just yesterday we heard Senator Griff say in this chamber that, in an ideal world, there would be more university funding. I remind my colleague and all senators in this place that more funding for universities is not something that exists only in the imagination; it's something that every single senator in this chamber has the power to make happen today. But this bill is not it. No-one should ever come to this place thinking that it's beyond their power to create a better and more educated Australia. In no place should we be making it harder for anyone who wants to study at university to do so.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've got a big challenge on our hands: recovering from this coronavirus pandemic and the economic crisis it has brought. The higher education sector has been hit so hard. We've heard this throughout this debate. In my home state of Victoria, the higher education sector is hurting. So many jobs have already been lost, and more losses are likely to follow. There's a big demand for places in higher education because people want to get new skills and get ready for a changed job market. But the package in this bill does not create anywhere near enough new places. We're also going to need to be smart. We need to grow and expand how much public money goes into research. Australia needs to be focused on actively getting ourselves out of this recession, not digging ourselves deeper into a hole. This bill guts research funding by rejecting the long-held notion that base funding—that is, student fees plus Commonwealth contributions—should provide for teaching, scholarship and base research capability.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is a dud. It's unfair, and it's going to hit young people especially hard. This package shifts costs of higher education from the government onto students. As my Greens colleagues have reiterated through this debate, universities should be well funded, high quality and free for all students. Education is a human right and a public good, and this government has an obligation to ensure everyone has access to high-quality, well-funded, free, lifelong education. Higher education in this country has been hit incredibly hard by the COVID crisis. These new laws will only make things worse. The government should invest in our universities and TAFEs, not starve them of funds.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="168275" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SHELDON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:22</span>):  I rise to oppose the Higher Education Support Amendment (Job-Ready Graduates and Supporting Regional and Remote Students) Bill 2020. The Liberals and Nationals have broken one of the great institutions of Australia: our world-leading tertiary education system. Instead of fixing higher education, this bill exacerbates all the worst elements of the current system. As Alison Barnes, the President of the National Tertiary Education Union, has said, it 'does nothing to address the funding and jobs crisis that is smashing our universities'. Let's be clear about what's happening here. The government are punishing the university sector to appease the culture warriors in their own ranks. The Liberal-National policy bin fire was already threatening to destroy what's left of our universities. This bill now pours fuel on that fire.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The COVID related closure of our international borders has had a profound effect on universities' finances. COVID has put a $4.8 billion hole in their income. Over the next three years, they will lose $19 billion. It's smaller regional universities that are really struggling in the pandemic. According to the Libs and Nats, it's the fault of the universities themselves—always a scapegoat for their own incompetent and culture-war decisions. They have conveniently forgotten that the sector's dependence on international student income, which has grown 137 per cent in the last decade, was created entirely by the systematic cuts to public funding. We must never forget that it was the coalition which capped government funding for Australians getting university places, And it's the coalition which has tried time and time again to bring in American-sized debts for students to compensate for the deep cuts in funding. At the end of the day, what this bill is about is cutting funding to the sector and shifting the cost burden to the students of working families, making it harder and more expensive for Australians to go to university while also making it harder for universities to deliver a quality education.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Worst of all, it punishes challenged students instead of trying to nurture their ambitions. This idea that we can penalise students by taking their funding fails logic. There is no evidence that supports this measure. It ignores the reality of how life works and will penalise students who need the most help to learn and to thrive. Award-winning Sydney University professor, Rae Cooper, told ABC Radio recently that in her first semester of university she failed dismally. She almost gave up, but then swapped majors and ended up being awarded a university medal. She said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I was just bewildered and lost and I didn't know how to navigate the system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Students studying law, accounting, administration, economics, commerce, communications and humanities will pay more for their degrees than students studying medicine and dentistry. This does not make sense unless we assume that the government would like the lawyers, accountants, economists and journalists of the next generation to come only from richer households—those households which feel secure enough to pay a great deal for the opportunity to study these disciplines. And, of course, our society will be greatly poorer for it. Again the NTEU president, Alison Barnes, has pointed out in her brilliant op ed in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span>:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Countless studies indicate the employability of arts and humanities graduates will increase as employers seek out students who can critically engage with dynamic problems.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Even the Business Council's chief executive, Jennifer Westcott, normally a strident supporter of this government, has said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We need our brightest kids studying the humanities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This package will not result in a single extra student doing STEM subjects. This is because the poor design of this bill actually gives universities less money to teach STEM courses like engineering and science. Analysis by Richard Holden, an economist at the University of New South Wales, shows that universities will receive $4,758 less per student per year for engineering, $3,513 less for maths and $3,440 less for agriculture. So universities will actually not be able to deliver the same level of quality of teaching that these important subjects require. Agriculture—note that: where are the Nationals? I know where Labor is: standing up for people in universities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When the minister announced this program in June he said that it was designed to boost the number of graduates in areas of expected employment growth. But then, in July, education department officials gave evidence to the Senate COVID inquiry that the government has no modelling about whether university funding changes will incentivise students to study science instead of humanities. This minister either hasn't done his homework or he is using it to cover and to perpetuate the coalition's culture war on this sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But it's not just the students who will be failing under this system; it's teachers and researchers too. Even before COVID-19, Commonwealth funding for universities was at an all-time low. And what do the consequences for our universities look like when we look at this?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They look insecure, with further mass casualisation and endemic wage theft, where mainly young university staff are denied even minimum wages because their work is deliberately misclassified. For example, Victoria is the only state reporting casual employment data for universities, which is compelled by law. It's data recently revealed 68.74 per cent of staff are employed as casuals or are on short-term contracts across the Victorian university sector. This has consequences for university workers, many of whom will have been in casual positions for many years and still have no job security. Shan Windscript, a PhD candidate and casual teacher at Melbourne University, recently described what it was like living on $300 a week: 'I certainly wouldn't call it a living wage.' She was working seven days a week. She said, 'It felt like a trap.' She wasn't getting super or receiving her entitlements like sick leave. COVID-19 will only make this situation worse.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A report released in July from the Rapid Research Information Forum and handed to the federal government estimated that 21,000 full-time equivalent jobs in the university sector were at risk by the end of year, with 7,000 estimated to be research-related academic positions. The bill does nothing to help that. This bill shifts the burden onto students, regardless of where they study or what they study, particularly if they're a Western Sydney student. Based on the estimates of the Centre for Social Justice and Inclusion at the University of Technology Sydney, the government's package will take half the funds currently allocated to supporting students from underprivileged backgrounds and give it to universities in regional and remote areas. It is not that they don't deserve it, but what about those people in Western Sydney? What about the economic hub of Western Sydney University that employs and engages and makes Western Sydney more liveable?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Senate Standing Committees on Education and Employment's inquiry into this bill heard testimony that the University of Western Sydney could lose $6.9 million a year under the government's package. Why take it out on Western Sydney? This is just another example of how this government pits communities against each other. It's failure in the member for Lindsay is stark in this example—failed to stand up for Lindsay, failed to stand up for Western Sydney and lost $6.9 million from the economy of Western Sydney, supporting the underprivileged. As Verity Firth, the former minister of education in New South Wales, pointed out: Western Sydney University has played a key role in expanding access to higher education for working class and first-in-family students. There is no reason why funding that is aimed at equitable outcomes should not continue to support the role of Western Sydney University, which has played such an important part. And yet, based on the Centre for Social Justice and Inclusion's research calculations, Western Sydney University is the biggest loser from this package. But it's not just Western Sydney that is missing out; no city or region will be left unscarred by the injury to our universities.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:33</span>):  A strong university sector is critical to the national interest now more than ever, yet, again, we have another attack on Australia's university sector. This is a bill that flies in the face of our national interest and fair access to a university education. This Higher Education Support Amendment (Job-Ready Graduates and Supporting Regional and Remote Students) Bill 2020 is yet another failure, another failure from Mr Morrison's Liberal Party policy machine, a machine vested not in the national interest but in narrow ideological interests. It's approach is vested in an Americanised attempt to attack our education system. The Liberal Party simply wants to make it harder and more expensive for Australians to go to university. It simply wants to attack the research fundamentals of our strong university sector. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A despicable deal has been done with Centre Alliance and Pauline Hanson to get this legislation through. It has no regard for the devastating outcome on universities and students. I say shame on Senator Griff and Senator Hanson. You have betrayed Australia's young people. You are responsible for all those young people missing out on a degree or paying more for their degree, and you are responsible for every university job lost. Senator Lambie and Senator Patrick, thank you for seeing sense in not supporting this bill. It was immensely pleasing to see your detailed examination of this legislation. You highlighted that you don't want to see a young Australian person from a poor background missing out on education and having a bright future. It's a shame that other members of the crossbench have not applied the same level of decency.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Amidst the economic fallout of a global pandemic, I would have thought that even this government would have a better set of priorities—upskilling Australians, drawing on TAFE and our university sector to rebuild our economy. Instead the government has attacked universities at a time when demand for education is growing. The increase in unemployment from the economic fallout of COVID-19 has seen an increase in demand for higher education. The government has talked about a so-called increase of 39,000 places. Those places are not locked into this legislation; they are on a wing and a prayer in terms of a promise to the sector. There is no funding for those extra places in this legislation. Universities have already been affected by the loss of international students and the decision by the Prime Minister to include them from the JobKeeper wage subsidy. That's seen over 10,000 university workers lose their jobs. Instead of bolstering the sector to aid access to education and economic recovery, the government has attacked the sector and rushed this legislation through under the cover of COVID-19. It is just the latest attempt to cut funding, increase student debt and reduce equity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The impacts of this legislation are far too high a price to pay. The impacts of this legislation will leave a legacy that will fundamentally damage the most important principles and benefits of higher education in our nation. The government has, quite simply, bullied the higher education sector into accepting a package that is clearly against the interests of students, the economy, research and innovation, the universities themselves and the nation. This government has rushed this legislation because it is up to no good. You fought tooth and nail against an inquiry that you didn't want. We had to contend with the government using its numbers to ensure an unworkable time frame to examine the legislation. This was all at a time when year 12s are doing their exams and have been confronted with the most difficult year ever.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government is so averse to scrutiny that it didn't release the modelling on the impact of its own legislation. You ducked responsibility to the parliament and to the higher education sector itself. It is unacceptable that the government has asked parliament to vote on legislation without doing the decent thing and highlighting and giving members of this place access to information about the real financial impact of this bill on universities and students. In the absence of detail from the government, I will provide the opportunity to give some numbers that senators and Australian students might find interesting under this legislation. Overall, the student contribution increases by seven per cent. Some might say that, in the current circumstances, that's fine. But let's look at the inequity of how that debt is distributed. Forty per cent of students will have their fees increased but the fees for some degree fees will increase by 113 per cent. Universities receive less—not more—to educate students in the very areas you say you want to prioritise: 32 per cent less to teach medical scientists, 17 per cent less to teach maths students and 16 per cent less to teach engineers. This is simply nuts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The University of Sydney highlighted nationally that women and Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students are heavily represented in fields that will have the highest student contributions under the proposed changes. The government says, and I'm sure I will hear this further from senators opposite, that the aim of this bill is to encourage price signalling to guide students into particular courses. Well, the simple fact of the matter is that if you want to guide students into maths and engineering you need to allow universities enough funding to increase the places for those fields of study. Time and time again, price signalling has been tried and failed. It doesn't work. There is no evidence—the committee saw no evidence—that price signalling works.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Instead of redirecting enrolments to a certain field of study, this bill means that some students will be paying $14,500 per year for their education, and, frankly, this is more than the combined government contribution and student contribution by more than $1,000 already. The difference between the lowest fees paid by students and the highest fees will grow by a magnitude of four. The policy rationale here is just not supported by any evidence at all. Higher-paying professions will have lower fees; lowing-paying professions will have higher fees. A graduate could pay twice as much for their degree and earn much less than another graduate with a lower student debt. It is nothing more than an egregious, ideological agenda that has no basis in the reality of employability and job readiness for graduates across their fields of study.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On top of clear evidence that price signalling doesn't work, universities, in evidence to the Senate committee, have admitted that the fee schedule is likely to motivate perverse enrolment and spending outcomes. A number of universities told the committee they would jump immediately to the maximum student contributions, because of the package's funding cuts. This can only be code for taking that $14,500 you may be charging a commerce, law, economics or humanities student, and taking some of the money that that student will owe in student debt as well as the Commonwealth graduate contribution, and shifting that money to the fields of study where income for those places has been capped. So, far from being useful price signalling, this will result in perverse enrolment outcomes across our university sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Universities admitted that while the new student debt component would be higher than the total 2020 income per student, there was no requirement that these funds be spent on these same students, just as I said. Universities can move income from both student fees and the government subsidy to other faculties where student debt has in fact decreased and, indeed, the government contribution has also decreased. It is quite usual for universities to pool their funding and do this, but never before have we seen such perverse incentives for universities to maximise enrolment in fields of study where they can charge a profitable fee so that they can cross-subsidise other parts of the university. It's clear that international students have been used in this way for some time in accessing our quality education system, but we must look at equity in our own system. We must look at employability and we must look at fairness.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Put yourself in the shoes of an arts student. I've spoken to a number of year 12 students who accepted offers for places at ANU or UWA before this bill came to light, before they could see what their fee structure would be, and have heard through the recordings of Senate hearings that they're likely to be paying top dollar, $14½ thousand. They've had no opportunity to respond to price signalling. If those opposite believe in price signalling, why are they rushing this legislation? Students have had to enrol in these subjects before universities made clear what fees they will be charging. People have picked their courses and are looking at studying hard and forging careers in fields that are in demand. They will be getting an enormous debt, up to $14½ thousand a year, only to find, as they begin their careers and try to save for a home deposit, that the money they have in student debt has actually been used to cross-subsidise students in another faculty. Humanities, commerce and communications students: you'll be paying more for your degree than doctors and dentists, despite the fact that your graduate incomes won't be as high. This is despite the fact that you're still highly employable and much needed in our economy. It is fundamentally outrageous.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Year 12s have gone through enough this year. This government paints a bleak picture of university life. Every member of the Morrison government went to university, and some would say they've done alright off the back of their qualifications. I find it absolutely galling that this government is trying to make it harder for disadvantaged kids to chase the career of their dreams. It is a staggering misunderstanding of the aspirations of young Australians and of the bright future that the mums and dads of our nation envisage for their young people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Perversely, this bill manages to construct a funding arrangement whereby for the areas of study where this government wants to see more enrolments universities will be paid less per student, but in the areas where the government wishes to discourage enrolment, off the back of these increased student fees, universities will have a greater income.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

It is a disgrace to be jacking up fees unfairly and distributing debt in this way. It disregards the aspirations of Australians seeking better opportunities through our nation's higher education system.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator HUGHES</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:48</span>):  I am speaking to the Higher Education Support Amendment (Job-Ready Graduates and Supporting Regional and Remote Students) Bill 2020. Australia is facing its biggest jobs crisis since the Great Depression, and our higher education sector must respond and play a critical role in supporting Australia's economic recovery.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted vulnerabilities across all sectors of Australia's economy, and higher education is no exception. However, there is good news for this rapidly changing sector and for the students it serves. While the Morrison government is providing record-high funding for the university sector, the system must adapt to be able to support Australians through this period, and it must be done in a way that supports the increasingly agile and innovative digital economy. We know that demand for higher education increases during economic slowdowns and that students seek newer, more relevant job skills to help them enter or re-enter the workforce. The coalition government's job-ready graduates reforms will support increased demand from school leavers and provide more option for upskilling and reskilling workers who lost their jobs due to COVID-19. The job-ready package will create an impressive 39,000 new university places in 2023, and 100,000 places by 2030. It will also provide additional support for students in regional and remote Australia. The coalition government already provides more than $18 billion a year to fund our universities. This will grow to $20 billion annually by 2024. The Morrison government investment will produce job-ready graduates that reflect Australia's expected economic, industry and employment growth, which is why there is an increased focus on areas of industry and community priority as well as work-relevant qualifications. These changes are good news.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The new arrangements will encourage prospective students to consider adding new skills sought by employers as well as their own preferences. In addition, higher education providers will work more closely with industry to ensure graduates have the job-ready skills and experience that they need to move into a new and more innovative and more challenging labour market. The Commonwealth Grant Scheme, funding clusters and student contribution bands are being simplified to make government funding for universities clearer, simpler and more sustainable. Overall, Australian taxpayers will continue to pay more than half of the costs of Commonwealth supported places, with funding prioritised to the areas of high public benefit and those most needed by the labour market. That means Commonwealth supported students studying courses in key growth areas, including science, nursing, teaching, engineering and IT, will see significant reductions in their student costs. In fact, around 60 per cent of students will see either a reduction or no change in their student contribution. The changes are based at a unit level, not a degree level. This means that by choosing electives that respond to employer needs in subjects like mathematics, English, science and IT students can reduce the cost of their overall degree and, at the same time, they will be enhancing their skills by responding to the needs of the new job market.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Students enrolled in teaching, nursing, clinical psychology, English and languages will pay 42 per cent less for their degree. Students who study agriculture and maths will pay 59 per cent less. Students who study science, health, architecture, environmental science, IT and engineering will pay 18 per cent less for their degree. Additionally, these reforms align the total combined funding for higher education units with the cost of teaching them. The new higher education funding model is based on universities' self-reported data on the actual cost of delivery of teaching in universities. Current students who are already studying in a Commonwealth supported place will be grandfathered in, looked after so they pay either the new lower or the same rates. From 1 January 2021, current students who enrol in units where the student contribution has decreased will have these amounts applied. Current students who enrol in units where the student contribution has increased will have grandfathering arrangements applied. This means their student contribution and the Commonwealth Grant Scheme amounts remain as they are under the current arrangements. Current year 12 students looking to enrol in a course of study in 2021 should be assured that they will continue to have access to the course of their choice under Australia's world-leading higher education funding model.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under our Higher Education Loan Program, the HELP system, no student needs to pay anything upfront, and student loans are only repaid when the student is earning over $46,620. A person on the lowest repayment threshold, which starts at 80 per cent of the median earnings of all Australian employees, will pay only $8.80 to $10.20 per week. Access to HELP is not determined by age, income or background. It means that eligible students can participate in higher education without the barrier of upfront fees. Prospective students should also remember that an investment in higher education is one of the best investments they can make. Higher education graduates have a substantial advantage in the labour market, with lower rates of unemployment and higher earnings than school leavers and vocational education graduates.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Job-ready Graduates Package includes a $900 million National Priorities and Industry Linkage Fund, designed to strengthen industry and university partnerships and prepare job-ready graduates. The bill extends Commonwealth support to more work experience and industry units of study. This will incentivise universities to include more work-integrated learning options in their courses and encourage students to gain more work experience from what they learn.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then there are the regional, rural and remote students. In addition to providing more student places at Australian universities overall, the government will provide more than $400 million over the next four years to increase opportunities for regional and remote students to attend university and to lift investment in regional university campuses. All Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students from regional and remote areas will have a guaranteed Commonwealth supported place upon admission to the university of their choice, a key Napthine review recommendation. For the first time, the Higher Education Participation and Partnerships Program will support regional, remote and Indigenous students, in addition to low-SES students, to access and complete higher education. The bill amends the Social Security Act to reduce from six to three the number of months a student living away from home must be receiving eligible student support payments before being eligible to receive fare allowance for a return journey home. This is another important Napthine review recommendation. Regional communities will benefit from strengthened and newly established regional university centres, enhanced research opportunities and growth through additional funding to regional campuses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The tertiary access payment, or TAP, is a one-off $5,000 payment for school leavers from outer regional and remote areas who relocate more than 90 minutes from their home to enrol in higher-level tertiary education. The new TAP will be available from 2021. This will be distributed to universities as a scholarship, and the number of scholarships allocated to a university will be based on its historical enrolment of students. The TAP will also be accessible, through Services Australia, to students studying at non-university higher education providers and VET providers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the package, the Commonwealth contribution to university funding, coupled with the students' contribution, will be aligned with the cost of delivering the course. There will be a funding floor for higher education courses. Funding certainty is vital for universities in how they plan for future enrolments and research activities. This bill includes a floor for future Commonwealth Grant Scheme funding, and that means table A universities will not receive less than the maximum basic grant amount for higher education courses they received in a previous year, commencing in 2025. The legislation includes the necessary mechanisms for the government to implement a transition fund for table A universities so that they maintain their revenue over the grant years as the reforms in the Job-ready Graduates Package are introduced.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Student decisions about higher education reflect a range of factors. Price is an important consideration for some students, though it's not the only consideration. For example, in 2009 the number of eligible applications to tertiary admission centres from students applying to study science was 13,795. That year, with much fanfare, the former Labor government reduced the student contribution for maths and sciences. By 2012, the number of applications to tertiary admissions centres and direct applications from students applying to study science increased to 26,373. In 2013, however, the Labor government very quietly increased the price by 78 per cent, and applications plateaued.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Younger students make choices based on the advice of their parents, careers advisers and university open days, and by talking with their friends. Older students are more price-sensitive and consider the return on their investment and future career opportunities. The Job-ready Graduates Package is seeking to align our funding with the national interest by encouraging students to consider their employment prospects on graduation among those factors. Graduating with a good future in growing parts of our economy is a win-win. University graduates with vocational degrees are the most likely to be in full employment, according to new data.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's Higher Education Support Amendment (Job-Ready Graduates and Supporting Regional and Remote Students) Bill 2020 will make it cheaper to study in areas of expected future growth. We're creating additional university places for Australian students and making it cheaper to study teaching, nursing, clinical psychology, English and languages, agriculture, maths, science, health, architecture, environmental science, IT and engineering. The coalition government is encouraging students to tailor their studies to learn skills that will be in demand in areas of future jobs growth. That means breaking down the traditional degree silos by enabling students to choose units of study across disciplines and introducing a price signal to students by making degrees cheaper in areas of expected job growth. We want our students to receive an education that sets them up for future success.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, under the package all Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander students from regional and remote areas will have a guaranteed supported place upon admission to a non-designated bachelor or bachelor honours course of study at the public university of their choice. Health is one of the fastest growing disciplines that Indigenous students choose to study at university. Between 2014 and 2018, Indigenous enrolments in health grew from 1,666 to 2,343—a 41 per cent increase. The popularity of STEM courses among Indigenous university students has also grown in recent years.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Job-ready Graduates Package aims to provide more opportunities for women and men to gain the qualifications they will require for the jobs of the future. Allied health and teaching are professions with substantial female workforces. It is these subjects that will see significant reductions in student contributions, meaning less HECS-HELP to repay once graduates are working. Women who elect to enrol in courses for the jobs of the future—STEM, health, education—will be more employable on graduation, meaning they will have a higher earning potential immediately. Over the past decade, there has been growth in the number of females with STEM qualifications. We want to ensure that this trend continues, and the Job-ready Graduates Package will support the ongoing growth of women with STEM qualifications and careers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Job-ready Graduates Package creates an additional 100,000 opportunities over the next decade for students to pursue university. It puts $400 million into supporting rural and regional higher education. It is unapologetically aligned to the employment needs of the country coming out of the COVID pandemic. Teaching, health, engineering, agriculture and IT degrees are all discounted significantly to encourage students and—just to remind this place—around 60 per cent of students will be better off, or the same, under these reforms.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Strengthening student protections in public universities also aligns quality and accountability in Australia's tertiary sector. Every student studying in Australia can be confident that, wherever they choose to study, they will be assessed as being academically suited to that study, their academic progress and engagement will be monitored throughout the course and they will be prevented from incurring debt for study for which they are not suited. These initiatives have been well-received by university chancellors across the nation. They will support our students to prepare to contribute to our strengthening economy as Australia moves forward post-COVID.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator STOKER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:03</span>):  Anybody who had listened through the course of this debate on the Higher Education Support Amendment (Job-Ready Graduates and Supporting Regional and Remote Students) Bill 2020 would think, first, that all Australians should and must go to university if they are to have a good and meaningful life. Then there would be people who would come away from this debate thinking that Australia has no ability to assist people from poorer families to get to university—that there's no loan scheme that allows people of lesser means to access university. You'd be forgiven for coming away from this debate thinking that life isn't worth living unless you get free education. Well, what a load of utter rubbish all of that has been.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's do some fact checking, shall we? University is not essential to earning a good living. University is not essential to having a good life. Trades, for instance, can offer you much more money, if that's what motivates you. They can offer you real chances to build serious businesses and to contribute massively to this nation, to your economy and to your family's financial independence. Many people are much better suited to a hands-on type of learning and working.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's do some more fact checking. There's absolutely nothing to stop a smart, motivated person in this country accessing education at university simply due to cost. That might be uncomfortable for some people in this room, but it is the truth. What we call the HELP scheme—it has been known as HECS in my time—allows for affordable loans that don't need to be repaid until that person is working and earning a pretty good living. That's fair. And it means that a kid of modest means—like me and, indeed, many people on the coalition side of this chamber—has been able to go to university despite the fact that they're nothing fancy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's something that seems to be getting lost in this debate—the idea that university is something that mum and dad always pay for, or the idea that you shouldn't be doing anything else but studying while you're learning. My experience of university was that working part-time while I studied was not only something that helped me pay my way but a big part of the experience of learning to be an adult. Working four jobs while I was at university taught me to prioritise my spending, to manage my time, to communicate with my employers about my commitments and manage them well, and how to chat to people from all walks of life and appreciate their different strengths and interests. I can tell you that the time I spent selling linen in a shop, bookkeeping for small businesses, waitressing in a steakhouse and in an Italian restaurant and tutoring schoolkids was good for me. I learned skills that I draw on every day in this place and drew on in my career before this. Indeed, I don't think it's unreasonable to say that I learned a lot more from that than I did from many of my university classes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The phrase 'free education' gets bandied around a lot in this place both by Labor and those in the Greens Party. But you know what? That is nothing more than a bold-faced lie. Everything you get for free has got to be taken from somebody else, particularly under the redistributionist worldview of those in the Greens. It's particularly hypocritical, though, when we hear this from Labor, because they didn't indulge their free-education fantasy when they were in government during the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd years. If they really believed that that was the right thing to do, then why didn't they do it when they had the chance? The answer is that actions speak louder than words. It is nothing more than a slogan designed to mislead young people in particular—a lie on which they never plan to deliver. The Greens might just be silly enough to genuinely believe in it, but, with their usual approach of 'Free everything for everyone', they've got no idea of how to pay for it. That's the kind of reckless indulgence that is only available to minor parties who know they will never have to come good on their talk. Talk is cheap. But let's hope it stays that way, because our nation would be an economic basket case quick as a flash if the Greens and their unicorn fantasy policies were ever the order of the day.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Madam Acting Deputy President Askew, you might not know that I used to be a sessional academic at a school of business and law in one of the major regional universities before I came to this place. It was a job I did part-time—there you go, part-time work again—while I was in full-time practice as a barrister. I really enjoyed teaching my students. It was a really fulfilling activity but I was regularly troubled by the concern that there were people enrolled in my classes who enrolled every year who never once submitted assessment, never once showed up, never once passed—of course, with that kind of record—and they got billed for it every time. It was a windfall for the university, which didn't have to apply any resources to educating these people. It was a bill to the Commonwealth which was, at least for the time being, paying for that person's non-education and it left a student with a bill, with no education—really—and with no plan to pay it. So, quite rightly, here, this government is putting this kind of practice to an end. It's simply common sense.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was also concerned about the job prospects of my students who found class, sometimes, a struggle. There were many who I thought were better suited to a less bookish way of learning, and there were more practical types whose strength in the practical was something to be celebrated and encouraged, because the fact is, not everyone is suited to the academic life. Not everyone gets the best out of university education. And while there's a real demand for people to be able to retrain at the moment, if we step back from the COVID crisis, I think there's a real conversation to be had about whether, as a nation, we are sending too many people to university, building them up with the expectation of careers in fields that simply aren't there. So this bill does something very good for students in that way because there is a reality that says we have, particularly COVID-related unemployment but, at the same time, we have skills shortages in some fields.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is about making sure people are getting all of the encouragement necessary to focus their education on the areas where there are jobs. Isn't that the promise that, as a country, we make to the people who go to university, the promise that what they are learning is something they will actually be able to use, that they'll have the dignity of a career in which they can work and earn a living and get ahead and rise to the top of their profession through hard work because we didn't delude them into believing they could have a career in a job that isn't there? I think it's just being honest. The fact is there has never been more spent on education, but we still have a real skills shortage, even as we are dealing with unemployment. So let's not build false hope in students by educating them in fields for which the jobs just aren't there, when we have real demand in great career areas that do lead to a meaningful job. This bill does great work in this sphere.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">By providing for cheaper education in areas where this nation has high skills demand, we are doing the right thing by students, because they won't finish university with a debt for an education that they can't repay because they've been educated in something for which there isn't a job. It's doing the right thing by students. We're putting them on a long-term path to success, not a long-term path to disappointment. It's good for our economy, because we're going to be able to meet those skills shortages so that businesses can snap up these talented, educated Australians and make the most of their talents to grow this nation's economy. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And it's good for the taxpayer too, because it means that as more and more of those educated people go into real work they reach the point where they can start repaying their HELP debt so much sooner. And that's the right thing to do by the Australian taxpayer, particularly those Australian taxpayers who are not themselves university educated, who never got the benefit of the taxpayers subsidising their learning and yet are nevertheless expected to do it for others now that they are paying tax. Indeed, there are people who come to me from time to time who say: 'I learned on the job; I did a traineeship. I worked really hard and I still work really hard. I never got five years at university paid for by the taxpayer, either in full or subsidised by half, and yet I'm expected to pay for it for everyone else.' It's a pretty fair point. Why do we ask the construction workers, the labourers, the hairdressers and the shop assistants to subsidise the career prospects of our lawyers, our accountants, and our marine biologists and our women's studies arts graduates? We asked them to do that, but it's a lot to ask for people who never got that kind of help themselves.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill makes modest increases in study areas where skills demand doesn't exist because we need fewer graduates in that area, and it makes it cheaper to study in areas where there is skills demand. When you step back and put it like that, you go, 'Well, this is just plain common sense.' The fact that we have spent so long in this chamber with people bleating at the injustice of it, carrying on as though this represents an enormous human rights violation—confected outrage of the most exaggerated sort—it makes me understand why so many Australians think this place is out of touch. Most Australians don't expect this. They don't expect free everything. Most Australians don't expect to be educated for free in an area of unicorn fantasy study for which there are no jobs and which others should be paying off, despite the fact they didn't get the same kind of education themselves. This is the kind of utter nonsense that explains to me precisely why Australians get frustrated with politicians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's do another quick fact check before I wrap up. There has been a lot of talk about student debt and, yes, we do ask students to make a contribution to their education. But let's not pretend that they don't also get support. Overall, Australian taxpayers will continue to pay more than half of the cost of Commonwealth supported places in universities, with funding prioritised to the areas of high public benefit and those areas most needed by the labour market. Quite frankly, to do anything else would be a dereliction of our duty to the taxpayer. It's right for people to invest in their own education, because they get some private benefit. But with that 50 per cent contribution from the Commonwealth, the public benefit that comes from having an educated society is also recognised. It is fair to students, to our economy and to the taxpayer; it is fair for all.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:18</span>):  I also rise to make a contribution to the debate on the Higher Education Support Amendment (Job-Ready Graduates and Supporting Regional and Remote Students) Bill 2020, particularly as a senator with an electorate office based in the Illawarra—of course, with a very successful university in the Illawarra. I will very much focus my comments on that regional space.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition government is providing record high funding for the university sector. But, having said that, I think it's time for the sector now to adapt and to play its part in supporting Australians through this very difficult period.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Stoker made a number of very important points, and I think it's important for Australians to understand that it is not necessarily a measure of one's success to have a university degree. There are many things that we ask Australians to do. Regrettably, in the 1980s, through some of the changes that were made by Labor and then Education Minister Dawkins, we saw many technical colleges simply become B-grade universities. As a consequence of that, in the passage of time, we devalued the importance of a trade. In effect, I think, we've seen the loss of a generation of young people who have not undertaken trades and who have been forced into circumstances in the belief that they had to have a university degree to succeed in life, and now we're facing skills shortages which are a direct consequence of those actions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Therefore, I think it is important to put into context that the Australian economy needs people to do all sorts of jobs. Some of those require university degrees, and some of them do not require university degrees. But, as far as those jobs that do require university degrees are concerned, I think it's very important to look at where we need people trained.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This package is very important, because it does support regional universities. I'd like to make reference, if I may, to an article in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian Financial Review</span> on 29 September by Robert Bolton.

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Commonwealth Reconstruction Training Scheme of the 1940s assisted thousands of returned servicemen and women to enter higher education, with a focus on medicine, dentistry, engineering, veterinary science, agriculture and science.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So let's look at the reform package. Basically, the package provides opportunities across three important objectives that will increase the number of graduates in areas where there will be employment growth and demand, such as teaching, nursing, agriculture, STEM and information technology. It will lift the educational attainments for students in regional Australia, and it will strengthen partnerships between universities and business to drive participation in workforce and increase productivity. We know that the reforms will provide the necessary funding to support additional university places—39,000 by 2023, and almost 100,000 places by 2030.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The new funding model and the approach to the new funding model are more nuanced, to one that determines a share of costs that need to be met by the government and students in different fields. In the article that I referred to, the one by Professor Wellings, he points out the key features of the package that are cause for optimism, and I'd like to refer to some of the key ones. The HECS-HELP scheme remains unchanged. It provides certainty for the future. The income contingent loan scheme, which was delivered by the Hawke government in 1989 with the aims of expanding the higher education sector and promoting greater access to promote economic growth, demand and affordability, will not change. Let's not forget, despite all the hype by those opposite, students will be free to study what they want, and the universities will have the necessary flexibility to adjust the number of bachelor, sub-bachelor and post-graduate places within their funding allocations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The funding from the Commonwealth is aligned to the actual costs of teaching, as presented in the 2016 Deloitte Access Economics report, <span style="font-style:italic;">Cost of delivery of higher education</span>. This, importantly, recognises and supports the activities that are conducted by universities and the benefits that they generate. We know the unemployment situation is dire and, as we have seen, universities are already providing short courses that address the national priorities of teaching, health, science and IT. There will be tremendous opportunities for growth in metro and urban areas on the fringes of Sydney, Melbourne and south-eastern Queensland in particular, and this will be due to the fact that more places will be provided for domestic students in areas where there will be employment prospects.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I have said, and as others have said, there are very strong regional and social inclusion elements, and the increased funding for the universities will provide for greater focus on regional, rural, low socioeconomic status and Indigenous students. There will be a three-year transition period for these reforms, and that will enable the universities to adapt and to prepare themselves for the necessary changes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it is important to also, at this point, stress—and I will do this in conclusion—that, at the moment, the university sector is facing headwinds from different areas. Now, let's be honest: some of those are of their own making. I have had the opportunity to speak to different people in the university sector, and I have stressed to them that, for some universities, the dependence that they have placed particularly on overseas students, and most especially on students from China, has now resulted in them facing financial difficulties. Clearly, not all universities followed the advice and the edict of their own business schools in practising diversification, which I would have thought was 'business practice 101'. And, yes, while the rivers of gold were flowing in relation to foreign students, and most especially from China, we now see that universities will have to cut their cloth according to a different design. At a time when the government is in circumstances where it has to bring into this place foreign relations legislation, which most particularly will address the activities of universities, it is a telling factor that universities have undertaken and have engaged in activities which have created a negative perspective as far as they're concerned by the Australian public.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So I say to those universities: you have made mistakes—I think it's important for you to admit those mistakes—but the government is now putting in place a very good package. My very strong advice to those vice-chancellors in particular who have engaged in seeking to provide, I think, misinformation in relation to this package is that it's time for you to get on board and to accept that the circumstances have changed, that it's time for you to do things differently and that this is a good package and to support its passage.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="H6X" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BIRMINGHAM</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:31</span>):  I thank the Senate and those senators who have contributed on the  Higher Education Support Amendment (Job-Ready Graduates and Supporting Regional and Remote Students) Bill 2020. This bill implements the government's Job-Ready Graduates Package, which was announced by the Minister for Education on 19 June. The bill demonstrates our government's commitment to reforming Australia's higher education sector to drive growth and support into our regions and in areas of national need and to position universities to best achieve the objective of producing job-ready graduates that help Australian drive employment creation out of the COVID-19 crisis.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill better aligns the funding of universities in supporting students for what it costs to teach those students. This allows the government to then support growth in the higher education sector and to support the creation and funding of an additional 100,000 university places by 2030. The bill also directs more public funding to students studying in areas of projected employment growth as well as areas of industry and community priority, meaning that there will be a significant decrease in fees for students studying in these areas. These funding changes will encourage students to pick the areas of study at university that are most likely to help them secure a job, grow our economy and ensure that universities are focused and have the capacity to produced job-ready graduates across all areas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Importantly, this bill will reduce the student contribution amounts for more than half of all commencing students. Students enrolling in teaching, nursing, clinical psychology, English and languages will pay 42 per cent less for their degree. Students who study agriculture and maths will pay 59 per cent less for their degrees. Students who study science, health, architecture, environmental science, information technology and engineering will pay 18 per cent less for their degrees. Crucially, this all occurs in the ongoing framework of the HECS-HELP system that ensures no Australian student need face upfront fees in relation to their access to university. The bill includes grandfathering arrangements to ensure no student enrolled in a course prior to 1 January 2021 is worse off as a result of these reforms. These grandfathering arrangements will extend the amended Commonwealth contribution amounts in the bill, ensuring universities receive the same Commonwealth contribution for those grandfathered students.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In response to feedback from the higher education sector, the bill will created the new disciplines of 'pathway', 'professional pathway social work' and 'professional pathway psychology' in Commonwealth Grant Scheme funding. This change will result in an increase in the Commonwealth contribution and a reduction of the proposed student contribution amount for social work or psychology units that are undertaken as part of those qualifications that are part of the professional pathway. We look forward to working quickly and closely with the sector to settle on the most efficient and effective way to implement these arrangements. The bill also extends Commonwealth Grant Scheme funding to more work experience and industry units of study, which will enable more students to gain critical workplace skills while they study.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also allows the government to establish its $900 million National Priorities and Industry Linkage Fund, which will provide universities with additional support to collaborate with Australian industry to design courses that best equip students with the job-ready skills and experience they need to succeed. The bill also improves flexibility for universities in how they provide places based on what they receive in Commonwealth Grant Scheme funding. This will enable public universities to better respond to student, industry, and community demand and ensure Australia's workforce has the right skills at the right time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will also introduce a maximum basic grant amount floor for higher education courses. This will provide funding certainty for public providers by establishing that their funding for higher education courses for grant years 2021 to 2024 must not be less than the amount specified in the Commonwealth Grant Scheme guidelines and for 2025 and later grant years must not be less than the providers' maximum basic grant amount for those courses for the preceding grant year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also implements some key recommendations made by Dr Denis Napthine in the National Regional, Rural and Remote Education Strategy. It will introduce demand driven funding for Commonwealth supported places for regional and remote Indigenous students. After the passage of the bill, all regional and remote Indigenous students who are admitted to a public university in a non-medical bachelor or bachelor honours course of study will be guaranteed a Commonwealth supported place. It improves access to fares allowance by reducing the number of months a student must be receiving eligible payments for fares allowance from six to three months for a trip home.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also enables the government's plans to introduce grant payments through the Indigenous, Regional and Low Socioeconomic Status Attainment Fund. This will allow for more support for regional, rural, Indigenous and low-SES students to access university, graduate and enjoy the benefits that higher education offers. The bill also strengthens and extends student protection and provider integrity measures under the Higher Education Support Act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Importantly, these amendments do not penalise students for circumstances beyond their control and include the ability to have units discounted due to special circumstances important and warranted. As such, new subsection 36-13(2) acknowledges the systems and processes that higher education providers have in place to identify, protect and provide support for vulnerable students who may be experiencing difficulty in their studies or who may not have the academic ability to undertake a specific higher education course. The bill also contains various technical and administrative changes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I flag that in the committee stage I'll move amendments to correct some minor technical issues in the bill: to amend the proposed completion rate provision in section 36-13 of the bill to specify circumstances where a higher education provider will be satisfied that it is impracticable for a student to complete the requirements of a unit of study; to extend until 30 June 2021 the loan fee exemption for all undergraduate students accessing FEE-HELP; to reintroduce from 1 January 2021 a 10 per cent discount for students who are eligible for HECS-HELP assistance and pay part of their student contribution per unit upfront; and to reintroduce the student learning entitlement, which will commence on 1 January 2022.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank all senators for their contributions in debating these measures, especially those who have engaged in such constructive discussions with the government as we work to improve access to the higher education sector and graduate outcomes. Indeed, I thank many across the sector—the many stakeholders, including universities, students, employers, and industry groups—that have worked with Minister Tehan and the government to provide useful and constructive feedback on the bill and the government's Job-ready Graduates Package. I commend the bill to the Senate.</span>

Subject to what Senator Wong has outlined, the opposition's position on the Treasury Laws Amendment (A Tax Plan for the COVID-19 Economic Recovery) Bill 2020, which is part of this motion, and sitting on Friday to deal with those bills, is that the opposition will be supporting that. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our view is that the government has decided to wrap up a range of tax measures in one omnibus bill and required that it all be put together. That does not allow us to separately deal with the rather significant tax measures that are included in this bill, which we would prefer to have the time to work through. However, we will not stand in the way of the income tax cuts, which we have been calling for since August last year, to be brought forward and for that money to flow as quickly as possible into the pockets of working Australians around this country. As I said, our preference would be that the government didn't choose to play politics and we are able to deal with these bills separately and allow for longer consideration of the large tax measures, including those that cost $27 billion, but that isn't possible. We're not in a perfect world; we're not in a world where we can choose some of these elements. As such, we will support the passage of those bills as outlined in the motion through debate on Friday.</span>

Shame on Centre Alliance and shame on One Nation for some petty deals that they've done, which Minister Birmingham defined as 'minor technical amendments to this legislation'. You've been taken for a massive ride, you know? You've fallen hook, line and sinker for government spin. You've been totally duped. There's nothing else to say about this.

Why won't you let us talk about this? Because you know that this is a bad bill. You know that this bill is going to disadvantage Indigenous people. It's going to disadvantage women.

Thousands upon thousands of students and uni staff have contacted all of us sitting on this side, and all of you sitting on that side, telling us how horrible, how bad and how horrific the consequences of this bill are going to be. Yet obviously, on that side, it's fallen on deaf ears. Well, it hasn't fallen on deaf ears on this side. So we still want to continue on and talk about these things and try and change some of the things that are in this bill. We want to debate your amendments. We want to see what you are amending. We want to have a chance to look at what they are and give you the chance to defend them. But you can't defend them—that's what the issue is here. You cannot defend a single thing in this terrible bill. It is indefensible what's going on in this bill. Shame on all of you! We will absolutely be opposing your guillotine motion. Shame!</span>

The Labor and Liberal parties are trying to con this country and con Australian people into thinking these tax cuts are going to trickle down. Well, I'll tell you something: it's been 40 years since Hawke and Keating, while we've been waiting for trickle-down to work, and the people at the bottom are dying of thirst.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I point out that, having formerly been a member of the Centre Alliance party, the rules in relation to gagging of debates were basically that they would never gag a second reading and they would only gag the committee stage in circumstances where there was obvious filibustering. What this gag will mean is that genuine questions that were to be asked will not be asked. We will not be able to get clarification on elements of the bill where there is uncertainty, and that may also affect later interpretations in any proceedings. It's an awful thing to do. We should not be gagging debate on the higher education bill.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CAROL BROWN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:11</span>):  The Sport Integrity Australia Amendment (World Anti-Doping Code Review) Bill 2020 seeks to amend the Sport Integrity Australia Act 2020 and the National Sports Tribunal Act 2019. These amendments would align Australia's antidoping legislation with revisions of the World Anti-Doping Code and international standards, which come into force on 1 January 2021. Australia has ratified the UNESCO International Convention against Doping in Sport. That means we have an international obligation to align our antidoping arrangements with any revisions of the WADA code. This bill seeks to give effect to that. In order for us Australia's antidoping legislation to remain appropriately aligned with the revised code and international standards, the amendments in this bill will need to be passed and given assent before 1 January 2021. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor supports Australia being at the forefront of global efforts to deal with doping in sport. In turn, we support Australia fulfilling its international antidoping obligations and, therefore, these arrangements, which will ensure our domestic antidoping arrangements remain aligned with the WADA code. This bill does three key things in response to the WADA code revisions: it adds relevant non-participants to the persons who may be subject to the National Anti-Doping scheme, it gives the Sport Integrity Australia CEO discretion not to publish the details of an antidoping rule violation when the athlete is recreational or does not have the mental capacity to understand the antidoping rules and it allows the CEO to respond to misinformation. This bill also makes consequential amendments to the National Sports Tribunal Act 2019 to enable a nonparticipant to apply to the tribunal for arbitration of a dispute arising under an antidoping policy. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to the measures I've mentioned, which respond to the WADA code revisions, the bill will extend the definition of 'athlete' to include persons who competed in sport within the last six months. This amendment is designed to deal with the potential for the current definition to be interpreted narrowly as only a person who currently competes, which would restrict Sport Integrity Australia's ability to investigate possible antidoping rule violations. Initially, stakeholders, including the Australian Athletes' Alliance, did raise some concerns with the opposition about the potential for this measure to impact retired athletes. Labor has worked with those stakeholders to seek clarification on that aspect of the bill. The government has since made it clear that this section of the bill does not apply to formally retired athletes but rather to athletes who, for some reason—perhaps injury—are on a short break from competing. Athletes intending to compete again continue to fall within the National Anti-Doping Scheme to ensure that they remain compliant with their obligations under the World Anti-Doping Code on their return to competition. Stakeholders have advised the opposition that, given the clarification, they believe this aspect of the bill is appropriate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor supports measures that strengthen Australia's protections against evolving threats to the integrity of sport. We recognise that these protections, particularly in relation to doping in sport, can place a large burden and a lot of pressure on athletes. We will continue to work closely with stakeholders and observe the implementation of Australia's new sport integrity operations to ensure they deliver the dual goals of protecting Australian sport and Australian athletes. Labor supports this bill.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:17</span>):  The Family Law Amendment (Risk Screening Protections) Bill 2020 provides legislative support for a domestic violence risk screening pilot program being rolled out by the Family Court of Australia and the Federal Circuit Court of Australia. This program, called the Lighthouse Project, is being trialled in three court registries—Adelaide, Brisbane and Parramatta. The Lighthouse Project will screen for safety risks in all applications and responses for parenting-only orders filed with the courts. The information from the screening tool will be confidential and only used to screen for risk and referral to support services. Cases will be triaged to provide additional assistance to at-risk parties and identify suitable case management pathways, which will include a new specialist court list designed to assist families identified as being at high risk of family violence. The Lighthouse Project was funded as part of the 2019-20 MYEFO, announced by the government on 17 December 2019. Funding of $13.5 million was announced for the Family Court of Australia and the Federal Circuit Court of Australia to pilot a systematic approach to identifying and managing family safety risks.</span>

It should have been done in the first sitting week of the year. But it's better late than never. Of course, passage of this legislation does not guarantee the success of the Lighthouse Project; it will simply enable it to happen. It's up to the government to ensure that the project is implemented properly and that the project is successful. Labor senators will be watching carefully. I commend the bill to the Senate.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill implements the Morrison Government's tax plan for Australia's economic recovery from COVID-19 announced last night by the Treasurer.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill delivers lower taxes for individuals and businesses. It will stimulate demand, support investment, boost economic growth and most importantly, create jobs. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">These measures are central to the Government's JobMaker Plan. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">First, we are lowering taxes for more than 11 million individuals who pay personal income tax.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">These tax cuts support low and middle-income Australians, with the majority of the benefit in 2020-21 being received by those on incomes below $90,000. In 2020-21, low and middle-income earners will receive tax relief of up to $2,745, for singles, and up to $5,490, for dual income families, compared with 2017-18 settings.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Over the next 12 months, personal income taxes will be cut by $12.5 billion. Taxes will be cut by $17.8 billion over the next four years. With more money in their pockets, Australians can spend more in our economy, boosting demand and jobs. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Personal income taxes will be cut by bringing forward the second stage of the Government's Personal Income Tax Plan by two years to this financial year. This involves increasing the top threshold of the 19 per cent bracket from $37,000 to $45,000 and increasing the top threshold of the 32.5 per cent bracket from $90,000 to $120,000. Under stage two, the low income tax offset increases from $445 to $700, which will deliver more money into the pockets of some of the lowest income earners. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government will also provide an additional low and middle income tax offset, worth up to $1,080, in 2020-21 that would have been removed under stage 2.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It all forms part of our plan that ensures that by 2024-25, around 95 per cent of Australian income earners pay no more than 30 cents in the dollar, on every dollar they earn. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Not only do we need more Australians with more money in their pockets out spending, we also need to back businesses that have a go. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The COVID-19 economic recovery will be driven by the private sector. Eight out of ten jobs are private sector jobs. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">That is why our Economic Recovery Plan includes substantial incentives for businesses to invest. This Bill will provide 99 per cent of businesses access to temporary full expensing until 30 June 2022. This will reward business for bringing forward investment. Businesses with a turnover of up to $5 billion will be able to deduct the full cost of eligible depreciable assets of any value in the year they are first installed. Whether it is a farmer investing in a tractor, a café in a new coffee machine, a manufacturer in new machinery or a services business in IT software, these investments will boost their productivity and boost our economy. With more investment, there is more work to do and with that comes more jobs along the supply chain. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We know that there are many businesses, which were sound businesses before COVID-19, are now in a loss making position. Under this Bill, companies with a turnover of up to $5 billion will be able to apply their losses against profits taxed in a previous year as far back as the 2018‑19 income year. This temporary measure will be available until 2021-22. It will allow these companies to access cash by using their losses now, to stay in business, rebuild and invest, rather than waiting until they return to profit. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Also in this Bill, the Morrison Government will invest a further $2 billion in Research and Development through the Research and Development Tax Incentive. Business investment in R&amp;D is central to the development of new products, processes and services that will help make Australia more competitive. Investing in R&amp;D provides jobs now and jobs for tomorrow. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill implements measures contained in existing legislation before this Parliament, with several enhancements. The enhancements increase the tax offset rates for all claimants of the R&amp;D Tax Incentive compared to the 2019 Bill, remove the $4 million cap on annual cash refunds, streamline the intensity test from three to two tiers, and defer the start date of the changes to 1 July 2021.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">And we know small business is the engine room of our economy. Under this legislation businesses with an aggregated annual turnover between $10 million and $50 million will, for the first time, have access to up to ten small business tax concessions. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This will cut their red tape, improve their cash flow and allow them to spend more time on their business than with the tax office. The changes are estimated to support around 20,000 businesses and their employees.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">These tax cuts and business incentives are all about delivering money into people's pockets, getting the economy going as we recover from the unprecedented impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, and getting people back into jobs. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Treasury estimates measures in this Bill will create an additional 100,000 jobs by the end of 2021-22.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator GALLAGHER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Australian Capital Territory</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:23</span>):  I welcome the opportunity to rise to speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (A Tax Plan for the COVID-19 Economic Recovery) Bill 2020—perhaps a little earlier than we had expected to be having this debate! This debate brings together a number of tax measures announced in the 2020 budget—in total, five of them—which I will speak to separately.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to start my contribution by acknowledging the very difficult economic times the country is in, the very significant economic challenges facing the country, the millions of Australians who have had their lives uprooted, their jobs lost, their businesses shut over the last seven months as the coronavirus pandemic has brought in changes which have had not only significant health consequences on our community but very significant economic consequences as well. This budget was the government's opportunity to address, both in the short and long term, some of those significant challenges.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The budget in itself is the third economic package that the government has introduced in response to the pandemic. It comes at a time when we are in a deep recession—the first recession in this country in almost 30 years—where we have 3½ million Australian workers being supported by a wage subsidy scheme, JobKeeper, that Labor called for and the government adopted. We have over 1.6 million Australians on the JobSeeker payment, the old Newstart. I think there are over two million Australians who have been receiving the coronavirus supplement to assist them to get through the very, very difficult times and put money back into the economy at a time when it is desperately needed. So we are in a very unusual and challenging time for so many Australians. The budget was the opportunity for the government to respond to some of those challenges, not just in the short term but in the long term and, in many ways, it was a missed opportunity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The budget outlined a debt-and-deficit trajectory that this country has not seen before. We have combined deficits of $480 billion and a deficit this year of $213 billion. We have net debt increasing to just under $1 trillion and gross debt exceeding $1 trillion—in fact, based on this budget and not any subsequent economic responses that might be needed, the Minister for Finance confirmed that it will peak in 2029 at $1.7 trillion.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I can't not take the opportunity to remind the government of the hypocritical and damaging campaign they have run to demonise debt and deficit over the last decade. In many ways, the challenges faced by the Australian community and the responses required have been a complete rejection of the approach that the government took over the last decade or so, where they used their so-called 'debt-and-deficit disaster' language to weaponise any sensible narrative about the use of a government's budget and the levers available to support people, the community and society. The contradiction and the hypocrisy and all of the dangerous language about a 'disaster' that they used at a time when they faced inheriting gross debt in the order of $280 billion—compared to releasing budget papers which have now outlined gross debt reaching $1.7 trillion—is not lost on the opposition.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would hope, out of all of the learnings from these last seven months, that there has been some in that regard: that the budget does exist to serve a purpose. It is not the same as a household budget. It has a very different purpose. It is to be used in a way that delivers outcomes for people. So when you introduced a budget like you did in 2014—in pursuit, at any expense, of your fiscal strategy at the time—that slashed a whole range of supports for vulnerable Australians, you left a whole load of people behind and that had impacts and it caused damage. Again, the complete rejection of that fiscal strategy, and the adoption of one which acknowledges the role and the need for government to invest in people and in our community when it's needed, is important. We've heard in recent days the government trying to pretend that debt under Labor is terrible and a disaster, while debt under them is manageable and fine—'no issue here'. So I do make that point.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bills that we see before us today form a large component of the government's stimulus response, in a sense, to the problems that we are seeing in the economy. There is a bring-forward of the stage 2 tax cuts to 2021 at a total cost of $18 billion. Labor has been calling for these tax cuts to be fast-tracked, I think, since August last year. We think they play a key role in part of the response. They shouldn't at any time have been considered the entire response, and so our support is contingent on that. They have a role to play, and we are not going to stand in the way of millions of families and working people across this country getting some extra dollars in their wallet every fortnight. We think that does have a role to play, and it is a change that we support.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We would have preferred to deal with that bill on its own and separate out some of the other measures that perhaps aren't as time critical and could have been dealt with in a more orderly way, allowing the Senate to use its scrutiny powers to inquire into those. However, the government have made it clear, and they've played this game before where they package up a whole range of initiatives into an omnibus bill and serve it up on a plate and claim that if you're not for all of it then you're clearly standing in the way of getting the tax cuts out the door. This is this government's style: push through, barrage through, blame everybody else, point the finger and take the attention off itself.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We would prefer—and I want to make this point very clear—having more than 48 hours, essentially, to work through the detail of the other measures, including the small business turnover, the amendments to the R&amp;D tax incentive and particularly the large measure of temporary full expensing of depreciation assets at $27 billion. I should make it clear that we do support the increase to that small business turnover threshold and the loss carry-back against previous profits. There is a price tag of $5 billion attached to that loss carry-back, not an insignificant amount of money at all, but we do think those are sensible measures. In fact, I think we had proposals very similar to those before, and they should be supported.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our concerns relate largely to the amendments to the R&amp;D tax incentive cuts and the full expensing of depreciating assets or the instant asset write-off of 100 per cent. That is at a cost of $27 billion. It is a massive measure that I think the Senate should have had the opportunity to inquire into for a bit longer than 48 hours. The member for Rankin in the other place has raised a number of issues around that. One is the fact that there is no long-term solution to business investment in this country. This is a very short-term measure, and it will create a very significant cliff at the end of it, which I'm sure the government acknowledge but which they haven't dealt with in this budget. It doesn't deal with a long-term business investment strategy. We know business investment was tanking in this country long before the pandemic. It was a problem. If you talk to anyone in the business community, the major issue they raise around the lack of appetite for business investment is the lack of an energy policy. I think everyone on that side of the chamber knows that too, but it is a tricky one for them to resolve. But that is the solution in many ways: to provide confidence and certainty to the business community if there were energy policy certainty at the same time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of the time that the Senate has available to it today on those two measures that I've drawn out, including the R&amp;D—and I know Senator Carr has a much better knowledge of the issues and the disagreements around the research and development tax incentive, including the cuts of $1.8 billion that were being proposed, how they relate to this new program that's been put in and whether the money is real—I think we need to understand that a bit more. We will have the opportunity in estimates to explore that a bit further. In the interests of the government wanting to pursue their strategy of pushing this through the chamber so quickly, any problems relating to these two measures are really worn on their head. They have to be responsible. If there are changes that need to be made as the detail of these programs is rolled out, then they need to make them. I don't think the government should accept that our support for this bill, the omnibus bill—and we have had no choice around how these measures are separated out—gives them a blank cheque endorsement of these programs. I say to the government: these are your programs. You've had the opportunity of months to design them. You are telling the Australian people they will work and they will deliver the outcomes and the jobs that we need to see across this country. It really is on your head. You need to address any problems. It is on your head if these policies don't do what we need them to do, which is to make sure that unemployment in this country gets as low as it can be, as quickly as it can be. We have very significant concerns around that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We think the other issues that are related to the budget and not in these bills are interlinked in the sense that the government are putting all of their effort behind these measures to drive the economic recovery at a time when they are cutting JobSeeker and cutting JobKeeper. I think the failure to address the permanent increase in JobSeeker in this budget is just mean. It's simply mean. There is absolutely no reason why, in the first weeks of October, the government is not in a position to give an answer about what it's doing for the 1.6 million people surviving on that payment in the long term. It's just wrong. They're trying to give certainty in a whole range of areas for the next 18 months to two years, but people who are surviving on the lowest of incomes don't deserve that kind of certainty? They cut JobKeeper. They restrict JobMaker to those under the age of 35—we have to explore some of the thinking behind that because it leaves almost a million people on that payment who aren't eligible. They have no plan for aged care. I think it's well understood that 51 per cent of the population seems to be ignored in this budget, and there's a lot of concern around that. They do not address issues around child care, women's homelessness or social housing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm sure we will continue to debate this budget in the months ahead and through estimates. Whilst we support the passage of these omnibus bills, we do lay down some markers that we do have concerns with a couple of the measures. It's firmly in the government's court to change those, but it's also firmly the government's position that these be passed today. The opposition will be supporting that, but we have raised some concerns which we hope the government is listening to and will take on board.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="282997" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SCARR</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:38</span>):  I'm absolutely delighted to rise and speak in this chamber in relation to the Treasury Laws Amendment (A Tax Plan for the COVID-19 Economic Recovery) Bill 2020. I'm absolutely delighted because the budget that was delivered on Tuesday night delivered for all Australians. The budget handed down on Tuesday night delivered for all Australians—every single Australian, including in my home state of Queensland and including people living where my office is located, in the Ipswich region of Queensland. It delivered for those Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Gallagher referred to there being no business investment strategy. That is simply incorrect. There are a whole range of matters which were brought down in the budget on Tuesday night which will promote business investment. The one thing you have to realise, Madam Acting Deputy President, is you don't have to dictate to private enterprise, to the entrepreneurs in our society and to the people who want to get ahead in this country what they should do with their capital and with their income; you simply need to get out of the way. You simply need to get out of the way and you need to structure the tax system so that it incentivises people and doesn't penalise people. That's what you have to do. You don't have to dictate to them that you should invest in this or invest in that. Government should get out of the way and structure a tax system that provides incentive for investment in this country, not disincentive. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is exactly what the budget delivered on Tuesday night. There were a number of initiatives in the budget that fall into that category, including the immediate write-off of eligible assets, which will be an absolute boon for 99 per cent of businesses across this country. There will be investments made in this country that we can't even dream of coming out of this budget. It also includes promoting the use of gas and more supply of gas—increase the supply of gas, bring down gas prices, promote manufacturing. It's quite simple: increase the supply of gas, bring down gas prices, promote manufacturing. That's what this budget will also do. There is $2 billion for research and development. There is the sovereign manufacturing initiative, which will provide specific incentives for our manufacturers to develop those industries and provide jobs. And there are the tax cuts themselves that were brought down on Tuesday night. They will also deliver jobs, because when Australians are allowed to keep more of their money in their own pockets they'll go out and spend that money or they'll invest that in companies which invest that money and generate wealth and create jobs. That's what happens. That's what happens when you let private citizens keep more of what they earn. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the matters which really attracts me to the tax relief that is being provided through the budget is that it is proportionate and it is targeted. The people who receive the greatest proportion of the tax relief are low-income earners. For someone with a taxable income of $30,000 a year, their total change in tax compared with the 2017-18 year will be 21.3 per cent less. We know that people in those lower income brackets are more likely to spend each dollar that they are allowed to keep after tax. For someone earning $35,000 a year, their tax saving compared to 2017-18 year will be 14.8 per cent. By the time you get to someone who's earning $200,000 a year, the total change in tax falls to 3.8 per cent, and that's the way it should be. The tax cuts should be targeted at the low- and middle-income earners—and they are, as those percentages show in stark relief. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the other aspects of the tax changes that were brought down on Tuesday night that I fully support is the fact that you can carry back losses. A company that generated profits in the year ending 30 June 2019 can carry back the losses which they incur or have incurred in the year ending 30 June 2020 and offset those losses against tax paid in the year ending 30 June 2019. I think that's an absolutely tremendous initiative. It recognises the fact the companies, the owners of those companies, have been paying taxes to the Commonwealth over a period of time. Those taxes are used to pay for health and services. Then, when the company has generated a loss, not only can it carry that loss forward but it can actually carry it back so it can get a tax refund and use that money to either reinvest in the business or help it get through this period. I think that's an absolutely tremendous initiative. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some of the other initiatives in terms of the tax relief have been targeted to make sure that the low- and middle-income earners are the ones who are actually going to receive those tax cuts. And they'll spend that money. They will spend that money that they're being allowed to keep through these tax cuts. Treasury estimates—and these aren't my estimates; these are treasury's estimates—that reducing the personal income tax burden on hardworking Australians through this measure will boost GDP by around $3.5 billion—billion with a 'B'—in 2020-21 and $9 billion in 2021-22, and will create an additional 50,000 jobs by the end of 2021-22. Those are Treasury's estimates—not my estimates, Treasury's estimates.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the current economic situation, we need every single job we can get. These tax cuts will help generate those jobs. How? By putting more money in the pockets of the hardworking Australians who have earned that money, by allowing families to keep more of what they earn, and by allowing families to spend more on what their personal circumstances need. They will be the ones who make that choice, not government. The hardworking Australians who have earned that money will be the ones who make that choice. I would remind the chamber again that the income tax cuts are proportionate; they are weighed in favour of low-income earners and middle-income earners. As I said at the start of my speech, for someone earning a taxable income of $30,000, the percentage change in tax saved is 21.3 per cent. For someone earning $200,000, it goes down to 3.8 per cent. For someone earning $60,000, the tax saving is going to be 17.8 per cent. Compare that to someone who earns $160,000; their tax saving is only going to be 5.1 per cent. That is exactly how it should be—to make sure those tax cuts are targeted to help those Australians in the low- to middle-income tax bracket.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We should remember that eight in every 10 Australians are employed in the private sector. In order to rebuild our economy and create more jobs, we need to kickstart that part of the economy, the private sector. It is expected that the tax relief given to businesses, the instant asset tax write-off, will also be a boost to GDP and job creation. It will provide opportunities for everyone in our society—in our cities, in the country and in our regional centres. My office is in the Ipswich region in Queensland, where I know many businesses are going to take advantage of these opportunities. I have visited TAE Aerospace in the Ipswich region. It is based in the industrial centre in Bundamba. As this budget was brought down on Tuesday, I was reflecting on how they will be able to use the tax relief that will be given to their business to invest in more capital—updating machinery, expanding their product range and providing opportunities to young people in the Ipswich region. And they are already doing great work in terms of providing those opportunities to young people in our regions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The $2 billion for research and development is also desperately needed in the economy at this stage. It will be exciting to see what Australian initiative, Australian enterprise, Australian knowledge and Australian know-how can generate with that R&amp;D incentive. I'm looking forward to visiting businesses to hear about how they are applying that R&amp;D incentive to generate jobs, create wealth and provide opportunities for all Queenslanders, for all Australians, to fulfil their true potential, whatever their background and wherever they come from.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="121628" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McALLISTER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:49</span>):  I rise to speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (A Tax Plan for the COVID-19 Economic Recovery) Bill 2020 and to consider the context in which it is presented. Senator Scarr has given us a long dissertation about the underlying economic management philosophy of this government. He spent quite a lot of time talking about how what we need is for government to get out of the way. I would make two observations. One is that it's a pretty funny thing to hear from a group of people who have just delivered a budget indicating that we're about to hit a trillion dollars in debt. It's a pretty jarring thing to hear in that context. The second thing I'd say is that it's also pretty tone deaf, because if the pandemic has shown us anything it is that government matters. When a virus, beyond our control, sweeps through our country and across the globe, government can't get out of the way. We've seen overseas what happens when they do: uncontrolled spread of the virus, uncontained disruption to the economy, unemployment, financial hardship and financial distress.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was actually the inclination of this government to take that same approach. They had to be dragged kicking and screaming to provide financial support to households and businesses and to provide fiscal support to the Australian economy. Wage subsidies were totally impractical and not on the table, until they were. The government were not interested in measures to support businesses until the Labor Party pushed for them. It's been the pattern, all through this period of COVID-19 and all through this year, that the government has only acted to support the economy when we push them to do so—measure after measure after measure in response to a Labor suggestion. We have tried to be constructive. It is a national crisis and an international crisis, and we have tried to play the role that a good opposition should at this time: to hold this government to account but to be constructive. But these guys make it pretty hard, because their contempt for ordinary people, their contempt for the information they hear from people on the street and their exclusive focus on their own interests make it very, very difficult to support the direction that they seek to chart.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We didn't have a lot of confidence in their economic management. The economy was already floundering before we came into the pandemic. Every now and then, when the government gets desperate, it thinks, 'What are we going do?' and it searches around in the bottom drawer for some ideas about how they're going to grow the economy, restore productivity and get the country moving again. Usually they say, 'Yes, we've got this marvellous Productivity Commission report from 2017: <span style="font-style:italic;">Shifting the dial: improving Australia's productivity performance</span>.' I just thought I'd have a look at that. I recall it had a good set of initiatives. When you go to the Productivity Commission website, it indicates that there is still no government response to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Shifting the dial</span> report. So you've got an economy with flatlining productivity and a desperate need to get jobs moving—this is even before we come to the pandemic—and a government that can't be bothered to even go and respond to the document that they commissioned from the Productivity Commission.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I remind people on the other side of what was in that. There were some suggestions about healthier Australians and reforming the health system. There was a whole set of recommendations about future skills and work. There's a set of recommendations about better-functioning towns and cities. There's a whole section about improving efficiency of markets, with an intense focus on the energy market, the great policy failure of this government, which has managed to get through seven years without a single energy policy that's actually implemented but 20 policy ideas that they never got around to doing anything with. The fifth thing is more effective governments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Wouldn't it be nice if there'd actually been some economic reform of some kind in any one of those domains prior to hitting January this year? Wouldn't it have been nice to go into the pandemic with an economy that was actually firing on all cylinders? Wouldn't it have been good to have a training system that was actually preparing our young people, and people throughout their lives, for jobs of the future? Wouldn't it have been nice to have an R&amp;D system that was actually supporting innovation in the business community? Wouldn't it have been nice to have done something about women—about the pay gap, the retirement incomes gap, their participation in the labour market and their need for child care that is affordable and of a high quality?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Wouldn't it have been nice to have done something about all of those things, all of those reform options that have been laid out time and time again for a tone-deaf government that refuses to listen and refuses to take responsibility for its role in the Australian economy? We've had to wait till there's a pandemic to see them actually take responsibility of any kind, and then, as I said, only when pushed by the Labor Party.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So we find ourselves this week with a budget that tells us we're up for a trillion dollars in debt but signals no coherent story at all about the future of the Australian economy. People will know that I've spent quite a bit of time since I had the very good fortune to be elected to this place thinking about the role of women in our economy. This pandemic has highlighted how significant the female workforce is and how important the female workforce is, particularly when things go bad, but also how precarious the nature of women's employment truly is. When the pandemic hit, who got laid off first? The casuals. And who comprises the casual workforce? It is the women of Australia. So it was women's hours and women's jobs that suffered the greatest hit. It was women who took up more and more care obligations at home when children were at home and being homeschooled. And it was women who bore the risk of turning up to frontline roles—in nursing, cleaning, retail, teaching and early childhood—to continue to keep things ticking over while we faced down this pandemic.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You might have thought that the conversation that had started to bubble away amongst Australian women would have filtered through to those on the other side. You might have thought they would find it within themselves to come up with just something of meaning for Australian women and their workforce participation in this budget. But, no, it is a budget devoid of empathy or interest in the lives of Australian women. It is a budget devoid of empathy and interest in the economic security of Australian women. It contains very little for them. We are spending twice as much on an IT system for the Department of Human Services as we are on the initiatives in the Women's Economic Security Statement. It is incredible! The Women's Economic Security Statement comprises one-third of one per cent of the new measures in the budget.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think that, in part, this situation arises because there are so few women in the cabinet, so few women on the ERC and, worse, so little interest by the men of the coalition in listening to the women around them. It is just shameful, because if they listened to the women in their electorates—listened to the women who work in their schools and the women who are dropping their kids off each morning—they'd know that there are a whole range of priorities that Australian women want to see addressed. But we won't find them in this budget. You won't find anything about tackling the pay gap. You won't find anything about improving access to child care. You won't find anything about the disproportionate taxation that occurs when women increase the number of working days from three to four, if they happen to be the second income-earner in their household—you won't find any responses to that. You won't find any relief for the women who emptied out their superannuation accounts because they were shut out of JobKeeper, because JobKeeper was designed in a way that didn't support the working lives of Australian women. You won't find any additional money for women fleeing domestic violence and looking for support from frontline services. It is incredible to me, and incredibly tone-deaf, that, in a period when there has been article after article in every mainstream news outlet about the rise in the prevalence and severity of domestic violence, this was not made a priority in the budget this year. What a depressing indication of the seriousness with which this situation is taken on the other side! How can you rack up a trillion dollars in debt and not do something about the epidemic of violence that is sweeping through Australia's households?</span>

What I can confirm, Senator McCarthy, is that when the pandemic first hit we did see that women were disproportionately impacted by the pandemic when it came to job losses. What I can also tell Senator McCarthy is that prior to the pandemic we did have a disproportionate number of older Australians and also older women who were represented on social security payments. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This was probably a result of many things, including many measures that had been put in place prior to the pandemic and many measures that have been put in place over a number of years, not the least of which was the increase in the number of young people who were coming off unemployment and going into work. It could also be the fact that we had changes to our pension arrangements, like the wife pension, and these changes had taken place over quite a long period of time and under successive governments. As a result of the fact that we had started to see probably a disproportionate number of older Australians on unemployment benefits or on welfare, the government has taken a number of initiatives to support older people who find themselves unemployed. </span>

They were the only words and subject points raised, so I would ask the minister, who has been speaking for in excess of a minute—and I understand she has taken time to get to the answer—if she could confirm the numbers in Senator McCarthy's question. </span>

                  </a>  I will get the exact statistics for Senator McCarthy because, as you could imagine, we are seeing the unemployment figures moving around quite significantly at the moment. I will certainly make sure that I get the absolute and specific statistics provided to you. I can give statistics that are old, but I would like to make sure that I give you statistics that are current post pandemic. As you would be aware, statistics pre pandemic probably don't mean a great deal. As I was about to inform Senator McCarthy, there have be a significant number of measures that have been put in place in recognition that we have a high number of older Australians who find themselves out of work. </span>

So employers of older Australians over the age of 50 have access to a $10,000 wage subsidy.

The Morrison government excluded many of these women from JobKeeper. Isn't their exclusion from the hiring credit scheme just the latest example of the Morrison government leaving women behind?</span>

The Morrison government has been absolutely dedicated to supporting all Australians before the pandemic but most particularly through the pandemic with an absolutely unprecedented amount of money that has been provided to support all Australians—and that includes older Australians. As I said before, we already had in place a number of very significant packages to help older Australians. But we must not forget that when the pandemic hit we saw a doubling, or a 100 per cent increase, in the number of people who required the support of our unemployment benefits system, and a 150 per cent increase in those under the age of 35. I would suggest that if I had come into this place after a budget where we hadn't actually addressed youth unemployment, you would be standing there criticising me for not assisting young people who have been disproportionately impacted by the number of jobs that have been lost. I think our track record in supporting older Australians stands.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Protecting our nation's security and sovereignty is essential to Australia's economic stability and also its prosperity. The 2020-21 Morrison government's defence budget is all about a safer and stronger Australia now and into the future. This government remains firmly committed to keeping Australians safe while protecting our nation's interests and also assisting our economy during the COVID-19 pandemic. This budget sees sustained and very strong investment in Australia's defence, with a 10-year funding model of $575 billion over the next decade. This delivers on the Morrison government's commitment to grow the defence budget to two per cent of GDP in the 2020-21 financial year. This achieves a commitment we made in 2013.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our focus in the budget and in our strategic update is on regional security, on maintaining our capability edge while creating Australian jobs. It also focuses on boosting cyber-resilience and supporting Australia's sovereign defence industries. This budget locks in $270 billion of investment over the next 10 years to continue to develop the capabilities of the Australian Defence Force. There is also a $1 billion investment that provides new and unprecedented opportunities for Australia's defence industry, which has been impacted by COVID-19. This will sustain over 4,000 Australian jobs. Also, Defence is committed to supporting Australians right here at home during emergencies of national significance. That's why the Morrison government is strengthening the ADF's ability to respond to natural disasters, to domestic emergencies and to pandemics both here in Australia and overseas.</span>

Continuing to develop Australia's sovereign defence industry is crucial to our nation's economic recovery, and also, as I've said, to the creation of many more multigenerational jobs for Australians. Currently there are already over 15,000 Australian companies in the defence supply chains. That represents over 70,000 Australian workers who are benefiting from our government's investment in defence. These numbers are continuing to grow even during the COVID-19 pandemic. South Australia is a key part of the government's investment in building Australia's maritime defence capability and also our defence industries. Just last week the Prime Minister was in South Australia opening the $535 million world-leading shipyard in Osborne South, which heralds the beginning of another local shipbuilding job boom in South Australia.</span>

That's why this government's unprecedented investment in defence capability and also long-term funding certainty that we have committed to in this budget is vitally important. It is not only important for the Australian Defence Force and for defence; it is also vitally important for all of Australia's defence industries. This 10-year investment of $575 billion, as I've said, includes $270 billion for new capability which will strengthen not only the capability and the resilience of the Australian Defence Force but also our industries and provide many tens of thousands of jobs right here in Australia. This government is delivering the much-needed certainty for the Defence Force, and the result of that will be that our defence forces will not only today be postured to deploy military power to shape our environment, to deter actions and also to respond— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

I would actually refute that the budget brought down on Tuesday night by Mr Morrison and the Treasurer, Mr Frydenberg, didn't contain anything in relation to women's workforce participation. In fact, the very substance of the Women's Economic Security Statement is around enhancing women's economic participation. We all know that, prior to the pandemic, economic participation by women in the Australian workforce was actually at an all-time high and we had also seen the gender pay gap reduced to its lowest level ever. So as part of the Women's Economic Security Statement on Tuesday night, we sought to undertake a number of initiatives that are really focused on making sure that we provide specific and particular initiatives around workforce participation. But that must exclude the fact that many, many other initiatives in the budget that were not contained in the Women's Economic Security Statement are also available for women to access.</span>

                  </a>  Those opposite can be mucking around, but the reality is that women are able to benefit from just about every single measure in the budget. Women benefit from university educations, women benefit from workplace and employment programs; I mean, Senator Cash's skills programs also benefit women. But targeting specific women's economic participation was the Women's Economic Security Statement. There are a number of initiatives contained in this statement, with five very specific priorities to build and repair women's workforce participation and to further close the gender pay gap. That was absolutely the specific reason for and the absolute priority of the Women's Economic Security Statement, along with many other measures in the budget.</span>

As I said in the answer to the primary question, before the pandemic Australia's women's workforce participation levels were at an all-time record. I would also draw to the attention of the chamber the fact that this government, the Morrison government, will spend in this 2020-21 year $9 billion supporting Australian parents with childcare subsidies. That is in addition to the $900 million that was specifically set aside during the pandemic to help Australian parents through the very, very difficult circumstances that they all found themselves in during the pandemic, particularly those people who were taking on important care and support roles.</span>

The arts and entertainment industry was the first and hardest hit by COVID restrictions. It will be one of the last to recover. It has seen the second-highest number of job losses, after accommodation and hospitality, which, of course, rely on the arts and entertainment sector as well. For every million dollars in turnover, arts and entertainment produce nine jobs. Construction produces only one. Yet the Treasurer on Tuesday night didn't even utter the word 'art' in his speech. Why has the $112 billion a year arts and entertainment industry been so forgotten by your government?</span>

The Morrison government are working hard to deliver on our plan to support the arts and entertainment sector during COVID-19. We have secured almost $800 million in extra arts and entertainment funding on top of our record annual investment of around $750 million in core funding and on top of the $336 million provided to date through JobKeeper. During one of our nation's most testing times, Australians have looked to our leaders to provide accurate and honest information, provide support to those who need it and to manage public money responsibly and that is, of course, why our government has provided very substantial support to this sector, and it would be great if senators across the chamber could recognise that very strong commitment and contribution that we've made.</span>

Of course, every country and every economy deals with the challenges it faces in its own way, consistent with its capacity. We are doing the best we can in the context of what is clearly a very challenging situation, and I think that all reasonable Australians and all of our friends across the OECD would very much agree with that.</span>

I think Senator Gallagher wanted to make sure that, before I left this chamber, I truly had seen everything. I now have, with the shadow minister for finance quoting the Institute of Public Affairs! That is exhibit A! The answer to that question is, no, I can't confirm that analysis. The Labor Party is trying to suggest that we can't make projections 10 years out, and Senator Gallagher is now suggesting that somehow there is a capacity to make projections 35 years out. The argument that the opposition is prosecuting right now is that we should spend more and that we should have a lower deficit and lower debt, as if that is totally consistent!</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are facing a very challenging set of figures. We are, though, in a better position than most other countries around the world as a result of the hard work that we've done during our first six years in government. The reason your figures weren't worse after six years of Labor government is because you started with a surplus, no government net debt and a positive net asset position. Guess what you left behind for us? You left us massive debt and deficit and a deteriorating trajectory. We have turned that situation around. We are in a better, stronger position than we would have been if we hadn't fixed the situation you left behind. Every reasonable Australian knows why we're here when it comes to the fiscal position we are in, and that is because of the COVID recession and the impact on the COVID recession on revenue, in particular, and government payments, and because of the cost of the decisions we've had to make to support the economy and to support jobs.</span>

For the anthropogenic-global-warming hypothesis to be accepted scientifically, it must be based on physical empirical data. During my meetings with the CSIRO it was confirmed that CSIRO relies only on erroneous, unvalidated computerised climate models, not physical data. This is the third admission of CSIRO's lack of empirical evidence proving causation. Both types of climate models have repeatedly failed to match physical data and observations, yet CSIRO has allowed this government to take confidence in climate models and that has led to policies economically destructive on the Australian economy. Senator Cormann, will you support an inquiry that would analyse and assess quantitatively the accuracy and levels of confidence in CSIRO's climate models?</span>

The debate that we've had in Australia over the last decade is about what the best methodology would be to achieve effective global greenhouse gas emissions in a way that is economically responsible. We think it is very important to maximise the emissions reduction effort in a way that is economically responsible. Of course, our success in securing emissions reductions in a way that is economically responsible and doesn't undermine the opportunities for working families to get ahead is a very important way to lead by example for the rest of the world, because if the rest of the world can see that we can achieve both emissions reductions and economic and jobs growth then other countries will follow our lead. We want all countries to do the best they can to help reduce greenhouse gas emissions in a way that is economically responsible, and I commend that approach to you.</span>

Minister, is it fair and reasonable that the most vulnerable people in our society—the poor, the elderly, students, the unemployed—are paying 39 per cent of their electricity bills on a fanciful, pointless crusade to change global temperature? It is a highly regressive impost on these people.</span>

I'm pleased to report to the Senate that we are being very successful in that endeavour. Electricity prices are coming down, both for households and for business, and emissions are coming down. And we are meeting our emissions reductions targets—both those that we committed to in Kyoto and those that we committed to in Paris. So we are achieving what we set out to achieve, but we are doing it in an economically responsible fashion, which we believe is very important. And it's only fair, for the working families of Australia, that that's how we do it.</span>

Australia has 2,691 wind turbines. That means you are making electricity users pick up the bill of $1.4 billion each year. That is $21.2 billion over their short lifetimes. How can you justify adding this massive cost burden to consumers and to industry?</span>

Australia's resources sector represents nine per cent of Australia's GDP, employs over 65,000 people in Queensland alone and is anticipated to pay over $4 billion in royalties to the Queensland government in the 2019-20 financial year. The Morrison-McCormack Liberal-National government has committed more than $200 million worth of measures to support the resources sector as part of this week's budget. Can the minister outline why our government is steadfast in its commitment to this important industry?</span>

Senator Canavan is a renowned champion of the Australian resources sector in particular. The Australian resources industry is a world leader when it comes to the extraction, production and export of high-quality resources. The industry represents a significant proportion of Australia's economy and is the backbone of many regional communities and towns across Australia, as Senator Canavan and all my Liberal and National colleagues know and appreciate. The resources industry represents some nine per cent of Australia's GDP. Importantly, that grew last financial year by 0.5 per cent, worth $7 billion extra to Australia's economy as a result. In 2019-20 our resources and energy exports reached a record of $290 billion for Australia. Our iron ore was the first commodity to ever record more than $100 billion in export revenue. Our gold industry is poised to become the world's largest producer; it is forecast to record some $31 billion of production in 2020-21.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Even in the midst of the most significant global pandemic and economic shock, the resources industry is investing in Australia, and in Australians and Australian jobs, with mining capital investment increasing by 5.4 per cent over the course of the last financial year. The resources industry is already a supporter of Australian jobs, employing 247,000 Australians in August this year, an increase of almost 6,000 compared with February this year. Of course, they are just the direct contributions; the resources industry supports so many more jobs than those direct contributions. That's why the Morrison-McCormack government recognises its importance and continues to invest in the industry and its growth potential. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

A $124.5 million expansion for the Exploring for the Future program will improve the understanding of Australia's resources, identifying the resource potential of key regions across Australia. We understand the importance of developing our natural resources, which is why we've committed $28.3 billion for five strategic basin plans, charting a quicker pathway for their development. We also recognise the need to provide communities living in gas development regions with independent and transparent information, hence our support for the CSIRO's Gas Industry Social and Environmental Research Alliance with some $13.7 million.</span>

Sadly, Queensland, even coming in pre COVID, had amongst the highest unemployment, the highest level of bankruptcies and the lowest business confidence in Australia. It's an economy that is so reliant on the resources, energy and mining sectors. That's why it's disappointing to see delays in approvals for developments such as New Hope's New Acland Stage 3. It's a prime example of legal and bureaucratic intervention delaying the potential creation of new jobs and new opportunities in a state like Queensland. And of course losing the potential for 500 additional jobs through these types of delays doesn't— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a>  Thank you, Mr President. My question is to the Minister representing the Minister for Home Affairs. Last month, ASIO advised the parliament that right-wing violent extremism occupies between approximately 30 and 40 per cent of ASIO's current case load in counterterrorism work, an increase from 10 to 15 per cent prior to 2016. This is an extraordinary increase over a very short period of time. In August, the Nine papers reported that ASIO has been focused on the possibility of extremists being inspired by killers such as the Christchurch gunman. As a Muslim and as a progressive senator, I find these reports incredibly troubling, but they align with what I see online, on social media and in the correspondence I receive. While it's good that the security services are investigating these threats, there appears to be zero political appetite to invest in new initiatives to address the growth of far-right extremism. What is the government doing to tackle the growing threat of far-right extremism and white supremacy?</span>

The JobMaker hiring credit is only available for additional jobs. Employers cannot reduce their current workforce, either by dismissing employees or reducing their hours, and engage new workers performing the same work to receive the hiring credits. We've put some integrity measures in place. The most important ones include the fact that any employer who wants to take advantage of this scheme has to demonstrate that both the size of their payroll as well as the number of employees is going up. So the business's total employee head count, with a minimum of one additional employee from the reference date of 30 September 2020, and the payroll of the business for the reporting period as compared to the three months to 30 September 2020, have to be higher. To demonstrate that the job is additional, those specific criteria must be met, so they must meet these double-barrelled additionality criteria in order to access this credit.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">As Senator Sheldon would be aware, all employees also have protections under industrial relations laws from unfair or unlawful dismissal, including non-genuine redundancies, and there are other integrity measures in place to ensure that employers cannot reclassify existing workers from contractors to employees to receive the hiring credit or move employees between entities within a single group. I hope that addresses Senator Sheldon's question.</span>

If the employer were to do this, they would no longer be eligible for the scheme. I would have thought that, if the employer wants to access the scheme, they can't do what Senator Sheldon has just described.</span>

Mr President, you'd be aware that this week's budget is all about jobs—backing those Australians who are in jobs and ensuring that they stay in those jobs and, obviously, getting as many Australians back into work as we can. A fundamental part of that plan is backing our small and family businesses every step of the way. They are the engine room of the Australian economy in so many different ways. They're major drivers of employment—in fact, employing over six million Australians—and they contribute around $418 billion to our national economy. The CEO of the Council of Small Business of Australia, Peter Strong, has welcomed budget 2020 as providing great things in it for small business people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of what we're doing for small businesses across Australia, we are, of course, allowing them to invest in themselves—we're supercharging the instant asset write-off by delivering temporary full expensing, allowing businesses to write off the full cost of eligible depreciable assets until 30 June 2020. We understand that so many businesses have done it tough as a result of COVID-19 and they need that important cash flow, so we're providing $4.9 billion in tax relief through temporary loss carry-back. This is going to allow businesses impacted by COVID-19 to write off their bad years against their previous good year. We're also expanding access to small business tax concessions. We're providing $105 million in tax relief to an additional 20,000 businesses and their employees. Importantly, in the skills space, we're removing costly barriers for businesses to train their employees by exempting employer provided retraining from fringe benefits tax. This will allow small businesses to capitalise on our $7 billion skills investment. Small and family businesses are the backbone of the Australian economy and, in budget 2020, we are backing them every step of the way.</span>

But, in particular, it has brought considerable challenges for our hardworking small business owners and their staff right around Australia. That is why the government in this budget is investing a further $7 million to support the mental health of small business owners through our business balance initiative. Business balance will expand Beyond Blue's new access program to small business owners and it will provide them with free, accessible and tailored support to help manage the pressures of COVID-19. We're also providing funding to expand Deakin University's free accredited professional development program to build the mental health literacy of trusted advisors like accountants and bookkeepers. It's been welcomed by Beyond Blue's chair, the Honourable Julia Gillard AC, and it will assist small business owners who have been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic.</span>

One of the things that has probably most greatly concerned me over the last few days in response to the budget by those opposite and others has been the lack of understanding of the depth of the measures in this budget that support Australia's women. As a woman in this place, and representing today the Minister for Women, Senator Payne, it is very distressing that we have not seen credit for the massive level of investment that has been made in all Australians over the last seven months, as we have managed our way through the pandemic and, again, on Tuesday night with the measures put in place to help Australia's women. As I said, apart from all of the general measures of which the majority are accessible to women, there are dedicated measures that are specifically targeted towards assisting women in this budget. We've been through them on a number of occasions in this place, but I'm more than happy to stand here again and talk about some of the great initiatives in Tuesday night's budget for women. These are on top of a number of measures that have been announced over the past seven months as Australia has come to terms with a pandemic that has never been experienced in the lifetime of anyone sitting in this chamber. </span>

What I would say is that I have been extremely disappointed at some of the commentary we have received about the budget that has lacked any understanding or acceptance that there are a number of measures in this budget specifically targeted towards women. But, equally, we have a number of measures—in fact, just about every single measure that is contained in the budget—that apply to women. And the idea that we would have a budget that's gender specific in every single measure that's contained in it is completely ludicrous.

The Morrison government is ensuring maximum opportunities exist for young Australians, with the best available opportunities in education and employment prospects and the most appropriate assistance for those who require help during the COVID-19 crisis. How is the government's plan for jobs, as outlined in Tuesday night's budget, supporting young Australians to access job opportunities and rebuild their connections to employers during these times?</span>

We know as a government that young Australians have been adversely affected by the COVID-19 pandemic and the resulting impacts on essential services, but Tuesday night's budget paved the way for a road to recovery. The coalition government has committed $4 billion to support young people into work through the JobMaker hiring credit, which provides a wage subsidy of $200 a week for up to a year to make an eligible position available for a young person aged 16 to 29 or $100 a week for those aged 30 to 35 who have been receiving the JobSeeker payment, youth allowance or parenting payment for at least one month within the last three months before they were hired.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Morrison government has always focused on creating jobs. Since the election of the coalition in 2013 to the start of the COVID-19 pandemic we have seen the Australian economy create 1.5 million new jobs. The budget on Tuesday night further demonstrated our government's commitment to getting the Australian economy back on track and Australians back into the workforce, with young Australians being a key focus of that commitment. The JobMaker hiring credit will accelerate growth in employment during the recovery by giving organisations incentives to take on additional employees who are young jobseekers 16 to 35 years old. It's expected that the JobMaker hiring credit will support around 450,000 positions for young people to move back into employment. As the Treasurer outlined in the budget speech, having a job means much more than just having an income.</span>

That's why the Morrison government has announced $1.2 billion to encourage employers to take on apprentices and trainees through a new commencement wage subsidy. This additional $1.2 billion will enable us to support 100,000 new apprentice commencements. As someone who started their working career as a tradie, I can only commend it to any young person out there who is looking to start work. It's a great start in life. This measure will help prevent future skill shortages and create opportunities for women and young people, including recent school leavers. Employers of any size or any industry, Australia-wide, who engage Australian apprentices from 5 October through to 30 September 2021 will be eligible under this program. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister has described those expressing concern that women have been left behind by his government's budget as 'voices of disruption and division'. More disturbingly, some young man—I assume it was a young man—in the Prime Minister's office took time out of his busy day to ring up a female journalist and take her to task for her coverage of his government's budget, saying that 'no-one credible' was making criticisms of the government's budget on the grounds of its inadequacies in terms of women. When the Minister representing the Minister for Women was asked about these comments, her response was simply to say she's concerned about the level of understanding about how her budget works. How patronising! When Australian women raise their voices and raise objections about how this government performs and responds to their issues, the answer is, 'Oh, they clearly just don't understand.' Well, I'll tell you what: if I have to choose between the Morrison government and the credible women who are raising concerns about their budget, I know who I will choose. I will choose the credible women every single day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For the people on the other side who don't understand the issues—because I think it's this government who doesn't understand; it's not Australian women—let me take you through it. We are facing the worst recession in almost 100 years. It's a recession triggered by a global pandemic, and it has disproportionately affected Australian women. Women have lost their jobs and they've lost their hours, and they've lost them at a faster rate than men. Since March, almost 200,000 women have lost their jobs, and 110,000 women have left the labour force altogether. At the peak of the coronavirus restrictions earlier this year, more than one million women had no work whatsoever, and outside the workforce a whole lot of new tasks accrued to women in the home: homeschooling and looking after unwell people—a massive increase in the burden of work at home.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, during the pandemic, what did the government do to support women? Well, they set up JobKeeper in a way that excluded short-term casuals, and that overwhelmingly impacted women more than men; they withdrew JobKeeper from the childcare sector, unbelievably; and the women who were excluded from other measures of support were told that what they should do was draw down from their already meagre super balances, forcing women to choose between their financial security now and their financial security in retirement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government had an opportunity to redeem themselves in this budget. They had an opportunity to fix some of this stuff-up, because there is no doubt that Australian women have borne the brunt of the pandemic and the Morrison recession that's accompanied it. But, despite racking up more than $1 trillion worth of debt, the Prime Minister's office rehashed the women's economic statement and allocated $230 million in new funding, 0.024 per cent of the new spending measures in the budget. For absolute clarity, we are spending more in this budget on a waste-recycling program than we are on the Women's Economic Security Statement. We are planning to spend more on buying petrol than we are on the Women's Economic Security Statement. We're spending twice as much on putting in a new computer system in the Department of Human Services as we are on the Women's Economic Security Statement in this budget. So, when credible women say to you on the government benches, 'Your budget does not deliver for us,' a humble government—a listening government—would actually take that concern seriously. It would listen and respond. It would not try to demean and diminish the voices of people who raised their concerns about its performance, because that is essentially the kind of arrogance that will not be rewarded.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">People who raise concerns about women's issues are not voices of disruption or of division. We are ordinary voices of Australian women who are tired of having our interests ignored by a government that only sees the world through male eyes and appears incapable of appreciating women's perspectives, uninterested in addressing them and hostile to hearing women's voices. I stand with the credible women.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="283596" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator RENNICK</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:09</span>):  What a great day to be doing a motion to take note, because I get to talk about my favourite subject: women. I'd like to give a shout-out to my beautiful wife; my beautiful daughter; my beautiful sisters; my mother, who has passed away; and my grandmothers. They were all working women. The one thing that we will never do on this side of the chamber is leave women behind. The other thing we will never do on this side of the chamber is leave our children behind or leave our families behind.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to reflect on the comments of another great Australian woman, Quentin Bryce, Australia's first female Governor-General, who said when talking about the complexities of trying to raise children and going back to work, 'You can have it all; you don't necessarily have to have it all at once.' I think it's terribly presumptuous of those on the other side of the chamber to think that they know what every woman wants. Some women don't necessarily want to go back to work straight away. Some might like to stay home while their children are young. If that's what they want to do we on this side of the chamber will support that, because we on this side of the chamber believe in choice and believe in our children. That's different to that side of the chamber, which believes in command and control. This side: choice, children, families. That side of the chamber: command and control.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, there's more to it than Labor like to make out. We've got it here from our old friend Aunty, the ABC. They're not the greatest friends of the coalition. A few years ago Fact Check did a piece called, 'Was Labor's childcare fund only ever about the union?' And the result was 'in the ballpark'. It says:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">However, there are reasonable criticisms of the amount allocated to the fund, the uneven way it was distributed and the adoption of a first-come-first-served policy. This process favoured the union.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One thing we will never do on this side of the chamber is unionise parenthood. That is the difference between this side of the chamber and that side of the chamber. That side of the chamber puts unions first. It doesn't put our children first. It doesn't put women first. It doesn't put the welfare of all Australians first. It puts the unions first all the time. Whenever they're talking about these issues, you can always be sure that, in the background, it's always about the unions. It's always about the unions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's just look at some of the numbers in the budget here. There are allegations that there's no money in the budget for women and no money in the budget for women's support. Let's just quote a couple of figures here. Women are getting $242 million for women's workforce participation. We're spending $240 million to get women back into work. I should also say there's $9 billion in this year's budget for child care. On top of that, there's $20 billion for the family tax benefit. I forget who it was, but one of the Labor senators mentioned that two-thirds of people who stay at home are women. We're supporting stay-at-home parents to the tune of $20 billion. There's parental income support of another $7 billion. There's child support of $2 billion. Support for the childcare system is $1.5 billion. There's another $600 million for families and children. All up, there's about $40 billion to help families—you know, women are a part of families. There is a lot of money in this budget for child care, for families and to help women get back into the workforce. So I totally refute the allegations that the coalition doesn't support women.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We should just touch on a few other big discounts in the budget here. I note Senator McAllister raised the issue of superannuation. If we look at the biggest tax concession in the budget—guess what it is! The second and third-biggest are concessional taxation of superannuation entity earnings and concessional taxation of employer superannuation contributions—over $40 billion in superannuation contributions. Wow! So I tell you what— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="140651" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator O'NEILL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:14</span>):  I find it hard to believe some of the contributions and some of the answers that we've received to our questions today about what is, in actual fact, confronting Australian women at this time. I also find hard to believe not only the tone-deafness of the answers that they've given us today but their inability to hear the reality—to see and understand the reality—of what is happening to Australian women right now in the course of this Morrison crisis that's been inflicted on us—I do mean the Morrison recession, but it's a crisis of great proportion because there is no adequate response. For example: before the recession, the Central Coast, which is in the electorate of Robertson, where I live, had the highest underemployment of unskilled female workers in the entire country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They have not been noticed. They have not been heard. There is no response. Despite putting us in debt as a nation to the tune of $1 trillion, those women's needs remain unanswered. These were women at the front line of the aged-care crisis and the front line of the pandemic, and the government has now turned its back on them. Women on the Central Coast of New South Wales lost work hours much faster than men, they were 50 per cent more likely to stop looking for work than men and they are suffering more significantly than men. You'd think a government would know about these things. You'd think the government would have some plan in their response, in their budget, to that reality. Data from the New South Wales Parliamentary Library shows us that employment growth slowed to a trickle while more people than ever were leaving the coast to commute for many hours for jobs. That's the reality before these guys got to the pandemic, and it's so, so much worse now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Rennick mentioned the union movement, and I want to stand firmly with the SDA union and other great union leaders who are the only voices standing up for workers, who are much maligned by this government. As they said, this is a blue budget for a pink recession. There is totally inadequate support for women. Two hundred thousand women who work in accommodation services, food services and the retail trade sector all missed out on JobSeeker due to its design flaws around casual employees. They're suffering, their families are suffering and, of $1 trillion that is going to be racked up as debt for this country, there is no relief in sight for those women.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The number of women on JobSeeker has jumped by 124 per cent over the past 12 months, surging past their male counterparts in August. What does it mean for the women who end up on JobSeeker? Let me give you a little bit of the flavour of what it was like for an amazing woman who gave evidence to a committee hearing that we had in Launceston at the end of 2019. This is the kind of Australian woman this government is leaving behind. Her name is Debra and this is what she said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I've worked a total of 35 years for Australia, and my last position was for 22 years. I've worked 30 of those 35 years in factory work so it was physical labour and your body can only take that for so long. In 2016, I was made redundant. The factory I worked at closed in November of that year, and I was made redundant in July. I went to Centrelink to be told that I had to live on my redundancy for 18 months, which I did. After that they put me on Newstart.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The equivalent of Newstart is JobSeeker. Debra went on to say:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">So to say that going from a paid job to Newstart is a shock to the system is a bit of an understatement because budgeting is impossible. There's just no money to budget. There's just not enough money to go around.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I've followed all the instructions from Centrelink and my job provider to the letter. I've had my payments suspended five times so far this year due to no fault of mine, and that's stressful. … When you get a text message—actually, on Wednesday I reported and, when I got to the end of my report, it said: your payment has been suspended. So I had to get out of that, ring my job provider and ask, 'What's going on?' It just happens all the time…</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">…   …   …</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">My medical scripts cost about $80-plus a month. I've used all my redundancy. I have very few savings left. Frankly, I'm scared about what's going to happen to me when my car rego and my insurance et cetera come in because there are no savings left—that's what I've been living on. I mean: am I going to have be forced to live in my car? It makes me very sad, and it's demeaning when our Prime Minister says that Newstart recipients are a blight on the Australian economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is the Mr Morrison who created the budget that we saw on Tuesday night. That is why Australian women are being left behind, because he simply doesn't care. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BRAGG</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:19</span>):  It is bizarre, to say the least, to hear opposition senators come into this place and talk about the 'Morrison recession', as we just heard Senator O'Neill mention. Obviously this is an issue which has gone right through the Labor Party. Dr Chalmers yesterday sent around an email talking about the 'Morrison recession' as if the COVID-19 crisis didn't exist. Now, the budget papers during the week revealed that, yes, the Australian economy has shrunk by seven per cent in the June quarter. That compares to a 20 per cent reduction in the UK and 12 per cent in New Zealand, so this is the global recession that the Labor Party don't seem to be able to come to terms with and that is inflicting damage upon the world's economy. Given that this discussion is about women, I will now turn to that matter.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This budget is about improving the economic standing of this country and improving the standing of all the citizens of Australia. Yes, our whole economic response to this pandemic has been to try to be as broad based as possible. We've spent $100 billion on the JobKeeper scheme, and that has kept businesses afloat. It's kept people in their jobs. It's kept people alive.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We can talk about the issues that have been raised during this motion to take note. As I say, the budget is based on a rising tide lifting all boats, 'all boats' being the Australian people. But of course there is a gender pay gap, which under our government, leading into this pandemic, is the lowest it has been on record, and so there is a recognition across our government that there is a need to deploy measures to deal with some of the issues that women, in particular, face. In relation to child care, which is often raised, I have never seen this as an issue for women. It's an issue for families. It is an issue for men and women. It's an issue for everyone. And so solving child care is not solving something which is a problem that should only accrue to women. It is something that families need to work together on, and I don't see this issue as just falling into women's bucket. But across the board we have deployed measures in this budget which deal directly with some of the shortcomings in our economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the roles I'm performing in this place is chairing an inquiry into fintech. During that inquiry it has become clear that there is a need for us to do more training and to spend more time, more effort and more resources ensuring that women have the skills to run tech businesses and to be successful in the tech space. And so in this budget we have deployed $25 million into STEM cadetships for women. We've also put money into boosting enterprise amongst women, with 280-odd startups expected to be created because of this scheme. In the course of this inquiry it's been a great pleasure to meet many founders and CEOs of fintech and regtech businesses who are women. There are many of them that are successful already, and we want to see more and more businesses in this space.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In this budget a number of recommendations of the fintech committee have been adopted. The research and development tax incentive recommendations have been adopted. There have also been changes to the fringe benefits tax arrangements that will be forthcoming. All of these things are designed, of course, to improve the amount of private investment into the tech space where men and women work, but we do want to see more women in this space, which is why we're deploying the STEM scheme. I reflect on some of the interactions that we've had at the committee, where there have been some brilliant women who've come up with a tech idea, gone into the market and established these businesses. They're now deploying things in the buy-now, pay-later sector and whatnot. This is a great tribute to female enterprise, but we do want to see more, so we are trying to provide some positive discrimination here in this field.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I summarise my comments by saying this is a budget for all Australians. The rising tide does lift all boats.</span>

Day after day, we see new evidence of the disproportionate impact COVID-19 is having on Australian women, but in response the Morrison government has failed. Women have been disproportionately impacted by the pandemic, taking on two-thirds of the unpaid care work at home. Even before the pandemic hit, a significant number of JobSeeker recipients were middle-aged women. In August, there were 754,100 women receiving JobSeeker. Of those, 61 per cent were over 35. The same research revealed a huge increase in the number of women in their 40s, 50s and 60s relying on unemployment benefits for years. A third of women aged at least 55 have been on unemployment support for at least five years. There are 460,000 women aged over 35 years who are without work and who face a future of living on $40 a day. They have been excluded from the Morrison government's hiring credits scheme and will need to compete against younger, subsidised jobseekers. So if you're a woman in your 40s who's been on JobKeeper during this recession, had your hours reduced, work in hospitality or retail and, come March or April, you lose your job, what is in the budget for you? Nothing. The Morrison government excluded many women from JobKeeper. The Morrison government only provided JobKeeper for two-thirds of early educators and then ripped JobKeeper from the sector before any other profession. Ninety-six per cent of early educators are women working on the front line of the COVID-19 crisis.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">What about First Nations women? Let's have a look at their story. There's no additional education funding for young First Nations women. The Clontarf Foundation funding supports the education of young First Nations men only. There was no additional health or legal services for First Nations women, no new money for further frontline domestic violence services, including no additional emergency and social housing to meet increased demand due to COVID-19, and no COVID-19 recovery support for unemployed Indigenous women over 35 years of age to regain employment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare estimates that of the 64,644 First Nations people who sought specialist help for homelessness back in 2016-17, 61 per cent were women. First Nations women comprise 34 per cent of all female prisoners compared to two per cent of the overall Australian population. Although the majority of people in prison are male—97 per cent—First Nations women are the most rapidly-growing population of prisoners, with rates increasing by 150 per cent since the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody—twice the rate of other females and double the rate of First Nations males from 2000 to 2016. These women have often experienced poverty, grief and loss, domestic violence, racism and poor mental health.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Ruston noted the Women's Economic Security Statement contained $240 million in specific initiatives for women. Despite the $1.1 trillion of debt, the Prime Minister's women's economic statement contains just $240 million for 51 per cent of the population. This is a pittance compared to multibillion-dollar commitments directed to various male-dominated industries.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The 2020 budget contains nothing to address the significant job losses in industries dominated by women, yet women have represented more than 50 per cent of job losses during the coronavirus-led economic downturn. There's no new funding for frontline domestic and family violence services that support women and their children escaping violence, nothing new to address the gender pay gap, nothing on superannuation and women's economic security in retirement, nothing on child care, nothing on social housing and no plan for women in Australia.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Finance (Senator Cormann) to a question without notice asked by Senator Hanson-Young today relating to support for the arts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I rise to take note of the answers given to my questions to Senator Cormann in relation to the lack of support for Australia's artists, the arts community, the art and creative sector and the industries that rely on our artistic and creative workers. On Tuesday night, artists right around the country were shocked that the Treasurer, after six months of the industry suffering because of the various levels of restrictions and the hard blow to the industry because of COVID-19, could not even utter the word art in his budget speech. It's just a disgrace. Hundreds of thousands of Australian workers within our arts and creative sector have been left out in the cold. Very little support has been put on the table for them. The government talks about the fact that they could have access to JobKeeper or JobSeeker without actually understanding that because of the nature of this industry, many, many artists and creative workers across the country have gone without anything. They don't qualify for JobKeeper, and some may be on JobSeeker, but, of course, we know that the government's about to force those people back to living on $40 a day, so it's hardly helping those who are struggling within those areas of work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The budget failed to recognise that this industry needs support, that it was one of the hardest hit, that it was the first hit by the COVID-19 recession and that it will be the last to come out. You'd think that this government would have bothered to put more support on the table. But, of course, there was nothing. One of the saddest things about all of this is that it pales in comparison to what other countries have done. I asked Senator Cormann about this. In the UK, the government have put 1½ billion pounds on the table because they understand that the arts and cultural institutions and industry and sector are vital to a functioning democracy, vital to the economy. Germany has put billions of euros the table. We know that in France they have allowed for a special unemployment scheme for actors, for performers, for artists who are out of work because of COVID-19. Of course, Senator Cormann is about to go and try and win the plum job of secretary-general of the OECD. It's not much of a track record you're taking from Australia, Senator Cormann, when it comes to the arts and creative sector.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the worst parts of this budget has been that it's those sectors which mainly employ women who have been the hardest hit. We're talking the arts and the entertainment sector. We're talking hospitality, tourism, retail. Despite all of that—most people who have lost their jobs because of COVID, being women; most people who have lost their hours because of COVID, being women; most people who are suffering through this recession, being women—there's really nothing in there for women. So, if you happen to work in the arts and entertainment industry and you happen to be a woman, it's a pretty bad budget for you—a terrible budget for you. You've been left on the scrap heap. It's absolutely appalling, and it begs the questions: Does this government have a problem with Australian women? Does this government have a problem with supporting Australian women to get back into work, to have enough income to pay the bills and to have affordable child care so they can get on with doing it? Why has this Prime Minister left Australian women on the scrap heap? Why has this Prime Minister left women out in the cold? He doesn't seem to like art very much. He doesn't seem to like culture very much. He loves the footy. He loves his tradies building renovated kitchens. And he's done nothing for women. It's a pretty sad day for Australian women and a pretty bad budget to boot.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">That the Senate records its deep regret at the death, on 27 September 2020, of the Honourable Susan Maree Ryan AO, former senator for the Australian Capital Territory and Minister for Education, Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women and Special Minister of State in the Hawke Government, places on record its appreciation for her service to the Parliament and the nation, and tenders its profound sympathy to her family in their bereavement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Susan Ryan was a passionate advocate for gender equality and a pioneer in the fight for the interests of Australian women. She leaves behind an extensive legacy full of firsts: one of the Australian Capital Territory's first senators and the first ACT senator to represent the ALP; Labor's first female cabinet minister; the first woman to hold the women's affairs portfolio; and Australia's first Age Discrimination Commissioner. But her signature achievement was the passage of the Sex Discrimination Act 1984—legislation that made sexual harassment unlawful and was a largely successful attempt to ensure that women had the same access to jobs, services and accommodation as men. The act has had a lasting impact on Australian women. It encouraged more women to seek education and employment, making it possible for women to hold employment and have a family life. These important social changes raised Australian family incomes and gave women more opportunities and economic independence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Born on 10 October 1942 in Sydney, Susan was one of four children to Arthur and Florence Ryan. Growing up in Maroubra, Susan was educated at the Brigidine school and was the first in her family and school to receive a scholarship to the University of Sydney, where she studied teaching. Upon graduating in 1963 Susan married Richard Butler, with whom she had two children. She worked briefly as a schoolteacher and then, after the arrival of her first child, Justine, she switched careers, running a small business from her home in Cremorne, the Living Parish Hymn Book Publishing Company.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 1965 the family moved to Canberra, and Susan embarked on a Master of Arts degree in English literature at the Australian National University. Her studies were interrupted when Richard was posted to the Australian embassy in Vienna. Shortly after arriving Susan and Richard welcomed the birth of their second child, Benedict. In 1970 the family moved again, this time for a posting to New York. But less than a year later Susan returned to Australia with her two children and resumed her master's degree. She joined the Women's Electoral Lobby in 1972 and the Belconnen branch of the Australian Labor Party shortly thereafter. The Women's Electoral Lobby began to push for direct political representation in 1974. Susan agreed to stand for preselection in the new ACT seat of Fraser. While she was unsuccessful at that election, coming third in the ballot, Susan would get her chance again in 1975, when legislation to provide the ACT with two Senate positions was enacted. Running on the slogan 'A woman's place is in the Senate', Susan was elected as one of the first two senators to represent the ACT and the first woman and ALP senator to represent the territory.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Susan entered parliament during a dramatic and challenging time for the ALP. The party had just suffered a landslide election defeat after the dismissal of Gough Whitlam as Prime Minister by then Governor-General Sir John Kerr. But Susan was not deterred. She came to this place to work hard and make a difference. She had ideas and ambitions. Two years later, when Bill Hayden became opposition leader he gave her the shadow portfolio responsibilities for communications, arts and the media as well as for women's affairs, a portfolio she would hold until her resignation in 1988.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Susan was focused on developing social policy, and when Bob Hawke led Labor back into government in 1983 she was appointed as the minister for education and as the minister for women's affairs. She was the first woman in the Labor Party to hold a cabinet position. During her time on the frontbench she would deliver important reforms, as I previously mentioned, including the Sex Discrimination Act, the Affirmative Action (Equal Employment Opportunity for Women) Act, the Public Service Reform Act and the Equal Employment Opportunity (Commonwealth Authorities) Act.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After five years in cabinet, Susan decided it was the right time to retire from her parliamentary career, and she took up a role as the managing editor of Penguin Books. Susan felt she had given the best she could to politics, and in 1990 she was awarded an Officer of the Order of Australia for service to the Australian parliament. In her 1999 memoir, <span style="font-style:italic;">Catching </span><span style="font-style:italic;">the </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Waves</span><span style="font-style:italic;">,</span> Susan reflected on her achievements, saying she was driven by the view that women should be able to pursue opportunities unencumbered by stifling stereotypes and that women and men should be judged on their merits—concepts that, thankfully, are entirely straightforward and universally accepted today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Susan served in many roles in her post-political career, including executive director for the Plastics Industry Association, executive director of the Australian Institute of Superannuation Trustees and Pro-Chancellor of the University of New South Wales. She also continued to fight to end discrimination and to fight for better rights for all Australians, serving as Australia's first Age Discrimination Commissioner and, later, the Disability Discrimination Commissioner. During her time as the Age Discrimination Commissioner, she worked tirelessly to advance the rights of older Australians. After the release of the 2015 <span style="font-style:italic;">Intergenerational report</span> she argued that Australia should move to a retirement age of 70, given we are living longer than ever before. In fact, in 2015 Susan wrote:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Why are individuals leaving paid work at 60, or often earlier, rather than 70? Even if they are more likely to live to 100 instead of 150 … Age discrimination in employment is a huge barrier preventing older Australians from continuing in the workforce. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">She said the report also implied:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… all those older than 65 are in need of substantial and growing public support—</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In her first speech to the Senate, in 1976, Susan noted there were only six women in the Senate. In 2019 the Senate reached gender equality in terms of representation. In part, this was achieved because of groundbreakers like former senator the Hon. Susan Ryan. Susan Ryan will be remembered as someone who dedicated her life to social justice and to making this nation a better and more equal place for all Australians. To Susan's partner, Rory, and her surviving children, Justine and Ben: on behalf of the Australian government and the Senate, I offer our deepest condolences.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="00AOU" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WONG</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:43</span>):  We honour today the life and contribution of former senator and minister the Hon. Susan Ryan. I speak on behalf of all Labor senators in offering our sympathy and solidarity to her family, especially her partner, Rory, and her two children, Justine and Benedict, and her grandson, Amir, and to her many friends.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is often said 'you cannot be what you cannot see', and yet someone has to go first. Those are the truest of leaders, who have the vision of what is possible, the courage to take on the fight against those vested in the status quo, the intellectual power to craft the strategy and the charisma and humanity to bring people with them. For us, for Labor women, that was Susan Ryan. She could see it: she could see a woman at the cabinet table, and she could see what Australia needed, what Australia needed that woman to achieve, and she made it happen. She wasn't a timeserver; she was a reformer. She came through first, but she brought others with her. She showed us the way. My generation of Labor women looked up to Susan. She inspired us in word and deed. She took a personal interest in all of us. When I saw her here, she would greet me with an enthusiastic hug, and she would always offer me encouragement and assure me I was doing well, that she was proud of me and of so many others who had followed her. That pride was mutual. Labor women have lost our sister and we will miss her. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Susan was born in Sydney and her early life had education at its centre. After convent schooling, she completed a Bachelor of Arts at Sydney Teachers' College before relocating with her family to Canberra, where she embarked on a postgraduate degree in English literature. This was interrupted when she accompanied her then husband, Richard Butler, on two overseas postings. As she described it, marriage at that time meant going wherever your husband went. She made the most of these experiences to gain knowledge and exposure to new and different thinking. She reflected that, on her return to Australia from their first posting in Vienna in 1969, the preoccupations of Labor at that time were vastly different to that of comparable parties in Western Europe. Opposition to the war on Vietnam was the touchstone for those in her generation who were politically active and with whom she would later serve.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On their second posting, in New York, Susan was sparked in different ways by the ideas of Germaine Greer, Betty Friedan, Kate Millett and Gloria Steinem, and she found herself questioning the place of women in society relative to the place of men. She questioned why everything in personal and public life was arranged for the convenience of men and why people pretended that even dull men were clever. At the same time, gifted, passionate women were passed over, neglected and restricted. She said, 'Those of us caught in the whirlwind saw that society was structured and manufactured by its rulers to achieve these endless disparities between the sexes. Our subordination was not destiny; it was a construct of men in which we had acquiesced for far too long.' </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, Susan Ryan would acquiesce no more. Her arrival back in Canberra led to deep engagement in both Labor and feminist politics. At the same time as becoming active in her local Labor branch, Susan Ryan joined the Women's Electoral Lobby as a foundation member. Across the country, like-minded women came together and began to organise politically—women like Wendy McCarthy and Eva Cox. Their objectives are familiar, perhaps depressingly so: confronting sexism, ending discrimination in education and employment, taking control of reproductive health, improving access to child care and achieving equal pay for equal work. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the Australian Labor Party, Susan Ryan hoped for a practical pathway to redressing the wrongs done to women, using legislative power to effect change. She rejoiced in the victory of the Whitlam government, although she missed out on an appointment to the groundbreaking new role of women's adviser. Her political activism led to a role running the national secretariat for the Australian Council of State School Organisations, a role that would connect her with another early leader of our movement, Joan Kirner, for the first time, and they would go on to have an effective partnership and lasting friendship. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Whitlam government lasted only three years, but it changed our nation forever. Susan saw Labor as the key to a more humane, vibrant and equal society, believing that a feminist lobby was necessary but not sufficient. Instead of being on the outside lobbying, she wanted to be inside making the laws, and, before long, she was encouraged to run for preselection. Susan Ryan was elected to the ACT Legislative Assembly and, after a false start seeking preselection for the House of Representatives, she ultimately prevailed in preselection to the Senate. In her characteristically tongue-in-cheek telling of it, she said that she overcame several reasonably glamorous male candidates. She was elected by the ACT as its first senator in 1975, one of just six women in the parliament, all senators. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the wake of the Whitlam government's defeat, she made the most of the opportunity to help rebuild Labor. She cut her teeth in the Senate in her first couple of years by taking every speaking opportunity, a whip's delight. This saw her contribute on debates ranging from Aboriginal affairs, social welfare, health and education to broadcasting, employment, defence and national security. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When Bill Hayden became opposition leader after the 1977 election loss, she became the first woman to serve in Labor's shadow ministry. Her portfolios over the next six years included communications, the arts and media, and, later, Aboriginal affairs. Perhaps most significantly, though, in 1979 she also gained responsibility for women's affairs. Her predecessor in the role had been a man—imagine a man serving in the women's affairs portfolio in any modern political party! I wonder when you have to go back to? She would hold this portfolio in opposition and in government for nearly a decade until her resignation in 1988.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor entered the 1980 campaign with a program for women called 'Towards equality'. We made gains at this election—not enough to take government but gains that delivered new female parliamentarians to the ranks. However, these were offset by the defeat of others mostly as a result of internal preselections that saw men take the place of women. This became one of the many impetuses for the introduction of affirmative action provisions within Labor: first for internal positions and, eventually, for parliament.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Affirmative action is part of why I'm in this place today. I was proud to take Susan's legacy on affirmative action forward with my dear friend, Sharryn Jackson, the then member for Hasluck, at the 2002 special rules conference, where we changed the rules to ensure more talented women got into the parliament. Labor now has more women than men in the Senate. That is the reason why the majority of senators in this place are women for the first time in Australian history. There are many opposite who argue that affirmative action is unnecessary and undermines the principle of merit based selections. I recall that catchcry from some in the Liberal Party: 'quota girl'. I'll leave it to others to judge the extent to which merit is the key metric for the selection of all of those opposite. Affirmative action recognises that structural change is required to achieve equality. It recognises that power doesn't just fall into the hands of those who haven't had it for much of the course of human history.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After the 1980 election, the Fraser government no longer had control of the Senate, and Susan Ryan used this opportunity to pursue two significant private senator's bills. The first of these was legislation that sought to implement antidiscrimination and affirmative action measures for women. This approach garnered support, fanned substantial media debate and committed Labor to action. Whilst that bill did not progress into law, Susan had started the fire and she would not stop until all of us were guided by its light.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The second bill related to her portfolio of Aboriginal affairs and sought to provide land tenure to First Nations people living on reserves in Queensland. At the time, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander citizens in Queensland were more thoroughly dispossessed than in any other part of Australia. With the backing of the Labor caucus and cross-party support, Susan Ryan confronted the blatant racism of the Bjelke-Petersen regime head on. This time the bill passed the Senate—only the 30th private senator's bill to do so since Federation—but did not get a vote in the House of Representatives. While progress on land rights was not as quick as Susan Ryan had hoped, there's no doubt she helped to spur momentum.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When the Hawke government took office in 1983, Susan Ryan became the first female cabinet minister in Labor history. She was appointed Minister for Education and Youth Affairs and Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on the Status of Women. She set about implementing the feminist agenda she had envisioned. At the top of this was to bring her private senator's bill on sex discrimination into law. That the Sex Discrimination Act passed the parliament in the first year of the Hawke government speaks volumes about Susan Ryan's advocacy and the impact of her capacity to transform ideas into action.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It has become common in some quarters to dismiss many of the policy achievements of the Hawke government as some kind of bipartisan project that was shared across the parliament. That is plainly inaccurate. The Sex Discrimination Act encountered significant opposition both inside and outside the parliament because of the magnitude of its reform. It's hard to remember that at this time it was not unlawful to discriminate in this country on the basis of sex in employment, education, accommodation and the provision of goods and services. A woman's credit rating and earning capacity weren't enough to get a loan from a bank. She could only secure credit if her husband or her father took responsibility. Landlords refused to rent homes to single mothers. Community clubs throughout the country were able to bar women. Women were sacked because of their age, marital status or pregnancy. All of these injustices and inequalities were in the sights of Susan Ryan. She called the Sex Discrimination Act 'probably the most useful thing I've done in my life'. I think that was a serious understatement. It is hard to imagine life in this country without it or, indeed, an argument against it. Every woman and every girl has benefited from Susan Ryan's leadership. Nevertheless, the opposition was fierce. Indeed, 38 conservative members and senators voted against it, including the then leader of the National Party and one Liberal MP who went on to become a Howard government minister.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Sex Discrimination Act was followed by the Affirmative Action (Equal Employment Opportunity for Women) Act, which became law in 1986. At that time, the Australian labour market was the most sex-segregated in the OECD. The act ensured women in the workforce had the opportunity to be recruited, trained and promoted on an equal basis with men. Susan Ryan heralded it as not just one of the biggest single steps forward in Australia's history for equality of women in the workplace but as a model of consensus decision-making consistent with the Hawke government's overall approach.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Parallel to these and other achievements for Australian women, Susan Ryan was also making significant inroads in education policy. When she started as minister, just three in 10 Australians completed high school. By the time Labor left office, eight in 10 students finished school—because of the change that she, and the Labor government of which she was a part, started. In her four years as minister, Susan created over 36,000 places in higher education, 4½ times the number created in the last four years of the Fraser government. She also strongly argued against the reintroduction of tertiary fees—at significant personal and political cost. Susan believed in education as a tool for social justice. She recognised its importance in lifting people out of poverty. On her retirement, Bob Hawke reflected that she had been a minister who drove rapid change and fundamental reform, and she remains Australia's second-longest-serving minister of education. In her final year, she also served as Special Minister of State and in other roles while retaining her position as Minister Assisting the PM on the Status of Women until her departure in 1998.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the 30 years after she left parliament, Susan Ryan would continue to make a substantial public contribution and held various roles in the private sector. She was recognised in 1990 with the award of Officer of the Order of Australia for her contribution to this parliament. She held various roles in the superannuation sector. She continued to work for human rights and, in July 2011, she was appointed as our first Age Discrimination Commissioner. In 2014 she was appointed as Disability Discrimination Commissioner. She brought a particular focus to the economic security of women. She also served as Pro-Chancellor at the University of New South Wales, and her interest in seeing Australia become a republic led to her taking on the role of deputy chair of the Australian Republic Movement from 2000 to 2003.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Susan Ryan broke new ground in Australian politics. Unsurprisingly, she endured misrepresentation and abuse. She had to cut through the predictable and tiresome preoccupation of public commentators, and even of her colleagues, with how she looked and her marital status. We need only reflect on how other female political leaders have been treated—and I'm thinking especially of Prime Minister Gillard—to recognise that Australian politics and public discourse still has much further to travel.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thirty-six years after the passage of the groundbreaking Sex Discrimination Act, we continue to see gross underrepresentation of women across our society. I return to the structural nature of inequality and discrimination. Many who have power in society like to believe it is because they earned it, that it is because they are the most talented and the most worthy. But do you know what? More often than not, they started out with power, and that means others started without it. Unless we take action, unless we make deliberate policy decisions, those structures will stay in place, recreating themselves generation after generation. Not only is that unjust to those who started without power and remain disadvantaged from birth to death; it is a great loss to us all. It is a great loss to society because people have talents and abilities that never see the light of day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In acknowledging all of Susan's many achievements, she would also expect me to point out some of what remains to be done, because across this country we find more women in lower-paying jobs and more in precarious employment, resulting in women finding it harder to be economically independent. Susan Ryan's wisdom helped give us some tools to see how much more there is still to be done. The organisation we now know as the Workplace Gender Equality Agency tells us that the full-time remuneration gender pay gap is at 20.8 per cent, meaning men working full time earn $25,600-plus on average a year more than women working full time. The full-time salary gender pay gap is 15.5 per cent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You see, as Susan observed, society was built by men for men and that is why Labor women understand there is a limit to 'leaning in'. We need to break down the structural barriers that block women's full participation and equality in Australia. We already have women retiring with 47 per cent less superannuation than men. Around three-quarters of the Australians who have been forced to withdraw from their super this year are women. That is not empowerment; that is impoverishment. Women over 55 are the fastest-growing group of people at risk of homelessness in Australia. Women over 60 represent the largest cohort on JobSeeker. Without access to affordable child care, many parents will be forced to give up or turn down work, and we know that is a sacrifice most often taken by women. Study after study has shown that affordable child care would increase women's workforce participation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This budget, which should have been a blueprint for our economic future beyond the pandemic, does nothing to increase women's participation, nothing to tackle insecure work or improve access to child care, nothing to address the gender pay gap or shrinking super balances and has no plan to help women and their children escaping family violence. A cabinet with Susan Ryan at the table would never have made those decisions. She would never have acquiesced, and she taught those Labor women who have followed her not to acquiesce either. She was the first, but her legacy in this nation will last not just in the laws she wrote but among the Labor women who follow her, because we will continue the project of building a truly equal Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our entire movement mourns the loss of one of our greatest. As we mourn her passing, and in closing, I once again extend my personal sympathies and the sympathies of all my colleagues to Susan Ryan's family—to Rory, Justine, Benedict and Amir—and her many friends. I spoke with Justine earlier today. She spoke of how completely her mother dedicated her life's work to the Labor movement.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Susan Ryan was more than an effective legislator—although she was certainly that—she really wanted to make Australia better. Justine told me how she recently found her mother's first campaign T-shirt, which declared 'A woman's place is in the House and in the Senate.' Well, in this chamber today and looking at those behind me, it is clear that is yet another campaign that Susan Ryan won.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">And so she did. She helped establish the Women's Electoral Lobby. She was elected to parliament as a single mother and became the first woman in the ALP cabinet. She was the first minister for the status of women and she set her sights on dismantling gender inequality. She introduced the first women's budget impact statement in 1984, which persisted until 2014 when former Prime Minister and one-time minister for women Tony Abbott axed it. Her work to introduce the Sex Discrimination Act was a crucial reform that has continued to shape Australian society. In abuse that will be familiar to many women in this place, conservative sectors called Susan Ryan 'radical' and targeted her as 'Australia's feminist dictator'. Yet these are the things she was trying to change: making it unlawful to sack a woman because she got married or pregnant, making it unlawful to sack someone because they were a woman, making it unlawful to sexually harass your staff, providing paid parental leave, allowing women to get home loans and increasing women's participation in university. Today, it would be completely unacceptable for those basic inequalities to persist. The change in that attitude is a testament to the work that Susan did.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Anne Summers's tribute to Susan noted the brutal reality of politics, noting that Susan's remarkable policy wins were often more hard-won than is appreciated today and seldom achieved without what were often excruciating compromises. Again, this is something with which many in this place are familiar. Too often women are expected to compromise. While much remains to be done to achieve gender equality, Susan's pioneering efforts built the platform for progress to continue to be made. I and the Australian Greens pay tribute to her fortitude, resilience and determination and thank her for opening the door for a better Australia for women and girls. A woman's place is in the House, the Senate and the cabinet.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator RUSTON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Families and Social Services and Manager of Government Business in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:06</span>):  I, too, rise to speak. I rise representing the Minister for Women, the Hon. Marise Payne, who's unable to be here today. I would also like to have my remarks associated with others in this place and with the remarks that were made by the Prime Minister in his condolence motion for the Hon. Susan Ryan AO.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the 45 years since Susan Ryan was elected, much has changed for the representation of women in this place. When Susan Ryan entered this house in 1975, she became just one of six women in the upper house. As has been said by those before me, her election slogan at that time was, 'A woman's place is in the Senate.' Today, that is absolutely true. It was very much an early pronouncement of the passionate advocate for women that Susan Ryan would become. Whilst I didn't know Susan Ryan, I have no doubt that she would be very pleased with the representation that we see in this place today, with more women than men now representing the Australian people in the Senate. At the time Susan was elected, there were no women in the House of Representatives. Not only that; there were no women leaders or ministers in any state parliament in Australia. From what I hear, there was constant confusion about who Susan was. Most young women in Parliament House were secretaries and assistants, and people would often ask Susan which senator she worked for. I can't imagine the kind of response that they might have got to that question! Susan focused on the job at hand and learning the ropes, ignoring the commentary, and has become known as one of the great trailblazers for women in this Senate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">She was also clearly someone who was determined never to become a single-issue politician. During those early years, she spoke on an incredible range of topics during her speeches, questions and Senate committee work. She talked about the environment, Indigenous issues, telecommunications, tax reform and urban planning, amongst many other things. She had an extraordinarily broad range of interests and, clearly, a focus on the community. She was rightfully proud and excited when she was sworn in as a minister in 1983—the first woman in a federal Labor cabinet. Many of us have seen the group photos of Susan with all her male colleagues at the time. I think it absolutely a true reflection of what this place was like back in those days.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">She combined her 12 years here in the role of senator for the ACT with her role as a mother. She managed to balance these two roles, as many people now do these days, without even a thought. So her trailblazing as a mother and a senator delivering on behalf of the Australian people is certainly a great accomplishment that she should always be recognised for.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As Minister for Education and Youth Affairs, she had many, many significant achievements, not the least of which was the significant increase in year 12 retention rates. She was also the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on the Status of Women for almost half a decade—a position proudly held today by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Minister for Women, the Hon. Marise Payne, whose remarks today are being delivered by me as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Susan was the architect of the Sex Discrimination Act, which made sexual harassment illegal for the first time and outlawed discrimination on the basis of sex, marital status and pregnancy. Characteristically, after leaving this parliament Susan kept on looking for ways that she could make Australia a better place for everyone. She became our first-ever Age Discrimination Commissioner and also served as the Disability Discrimination Commissioner. From 2000 to 2007 she was the President of the Australian Institute of Superannuation Trustees, and she was the Chancellor of the University of New South Wales for over a decade. These roles in postpolitics life allowed Susan to follow her passion for helping people transcend limitations and overcome constraints, with a focus on all people equally.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Susan was a powerhouse, a lively and energetic part of Australia's national story and absolutely a true groundbreaker. Susan's sudden death was a shock to many. While I did not know Susan personally, I know that in the parliament the memory of Susan as a woman leader will be honoured well into the future. I know the Minister for Women would have liked to be here today to make remarks and associate herself with the condolence motion being given today, because I know that Susan played a very, very important role in Minister Payne's life, as she did for so many other women in this parliament. Without a doubt, every one of us here today is a beneficiary of the legacy that she leaves us. To her partner, her children, her friends and her close ones we offer our heartfelt condolences. To Susan: we give you our thanks.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="207825" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McKENZIE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Nationals in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:11</span>):  As Leader of The Nationals in the Senate, I rise today to acknowledge the passing of former senator and minister the Hon. Susan Ryan and associate the National Party with the comments of senators and leaders here today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst we can argue the toss on structural change or cultural change when it comes to women's changing and evolving role in society and in parliament as one of the key institutions of our liberal democracy, I think all of us in this chamber can be very proud—albeit our different approaches—of increasing women's involvement in parliamentary life and public debate and how that will actually have flow-on benefits to the broader community. But for Senator Susan Ryan to be the first meant that the burden was heavier and you needed to get it just right so that there would be successive women after you. I think it's amazing, what she was able to achieve. The slogan that I think Senator Wong mentioned, 'A woman's place is in the House and the Senate,' was a T-shirt I also was given on getting preselected, so I think that slogan resonates with a lot of us who get here.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think being the first woman to hold a ministerial office is something to note, and also that she championed education. To that point, it is the National Party constituency that really benefited from that increase in higher education places and that increase in year 12 attainment. Previous to the Hawke government's reforms, the percentage of Australian young people that headed off to university was incredibly small and predominantly came from elite families in capital cities. So opening that up really increased the enfranchisement and inclusion of people who don't go to grammar schools, which is also a good thing—and I say that as a proud grammarian. It was a great reform.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Her lasting legacy, though, is the landmark Sex Discrimination Act and the affirmative action act. Senator Waters stood up and proudly proclaimed how many female senators the Greens have, and I know the Labor Party have some structural mechanisms to ensure that they get a certain number of female senators and House of Representatives members in this place. The National Party is proud that 80 per cent of our senators are female. We did not have structural readjustment but had a grassroots full enfranchisement of our membership voting for every single one of the strong, articulate, intelligent women our divisions have sent here. I think that speaks more broadly to what we can all do, on both sides of the chamber, to increase the diversity of our parliament. We come here with different value systems, obviously, and therefore represent the broader Australian public, but we can all do better in our own way. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When Susan Ryan came to the Senate in 1975, there were just six women senators. I think Senator Ruston made great comments about how this chamber really reflects the work of Susan Ryan and all who've come after her, on both sides of the chamber, to increase the inclusion of women. Also, being a single mum and a minister is pretty tough, and I think it is an incredible feat to be the first woman to do so, before partners might have chosen to look after kids or there was even childcare available. That speaks to her strength and her determination to represent her community and her government. Sympathies to her family and friends. Vale Susan Ryan. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Australian Capital Territory</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Finance, Charities and Electoral Matters</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:16</span>):  As a senator for the ACT, I want to pay special tribute to the Hon. Susan Ryan and send condolences to her family and to her loved ones. As has been pointed out, Susan Ryan, like a few of us in this chamber, had a background in what was a precursor to the ACT Legislative Assembly, as Senator Gallagher and I did, before going on to represent the ACT in the Senate. Susan Ryan had the great honour to represent the ACT as a senator from 1975 as one of the first two senators representing the Australian Capital Territory. It's great that we can now follow in the footsteps of others. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We talk about the legacy of Susan Ryan in terms of being a trailblazer for women. We've seen that, obviously, in the ACT Legislative Assembly, which has had a number of female chief ministers from both sides of politics, with Labor's Rosemary Follett, Liberal Kate Carnell and now-Senator Katy Gallagher, and a number of women in senior positions. I make a similar point to one that was made in terms of female representation, as we celebrate the fact that females are in a majority in the Senate. In the ACT Legislative Assembly we see the same thing. We see that both the Labor Party and the Liberal Party have a majority of women as we speak, but we've gotten there using different paths. The ACT Liberals have chosen to get there not through the use of quotas, but we do believe that we have outstanding representatives one way or another. It's been a great privilege to see that evolution, and in Canberra I think we see it most particularly. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Susan Ryan had the opportunity to serve in the Hawke ministry, first as the Minister assisting the Prime Minister on the Status of Women and then as the Minister for Education and Youth Affairs. Some of her achievements in both of those portfolios have been touched on, but I think Susan Ryan was most proud of one of her achievements in education, and that was changes to the year 12 retention rate. I commend that work. She had a very distinguished career after politics, after leaving this place, when she held very important positions, a number of which have been mentioned, including positions at universities, in superannuation and as the Age Discrimination Commissioner. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Susan Ryan was a senator when I was growing up here in Canberra, along with the great Margaret Reid, former President of the Senate, so we were well represented. As a young boy growing up in the 1980s, I didn't know Susan Ryan in her role as one of the senators representing the ACT, but I did have the opportunity to meet her in her later role as Age Discrimination Commissioner. I found her to be a thoroughly decent, highly engaging, highly intelligent and very impressive human being. But I also found that, given her reputation, I was quite struck by the great humility which she displayed in the way that she dealt with those around her.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, there are a couple of those great contributions that have been mentioned that are worth reiterating: the Sex Discrimination Act and making sexual harassment illegal for the first time—a great step forward—and the Affirmative Action (Equal Employment Opportunity for Women) Act. Susan Ryan once reflected that politics is like diving into the surf. She said: 'You don't linger at the edge; you jump in and fight your way through the breakers. Finally you get to the still, deep water beyond. You see if you can catch a wave and ride it to the shore. Few things in life are as exhilarating. When the wave has finished, it's not the end of the story.' I pay tribute to Susan Ryan's life and to her public legacy, and I send my condolences to her loved ones, her friends and her family. May she rest in peace.</span>

Former Senator Ryan was elected as the first Labor senator for the ACT in 1975. Her slogan at the time was, 'A woman's place is in the House, in the Senate and everywhere decisions are made.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Her path to the Senate is reasonably well known. Susan trained as a teacher and worked in the profession until the birth of her first child. Along with her family, Susan moved to Canberra in 1965 and enrolled as a postgraduate at ANU. Despite living overseas and studying, she never lost her passion for education and was appointed as the national executive officer for the Australian Council of State School Organisations in 1973. Her involvement in the women's movement, particularly the formation of the Women's Electoral Lobby, convinced her that her fight for equality had to take on a more pointed political approach. So she joined the Australian Labor Party and became active on behalf of her local community. A short stint on the non-governing ACT House of Assembly preceded her election to this chamber in 1975. Some years after her time in the Senate, she said of her election:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">After being elected in 1975, I joined four women who had already been in the Senate for a short period, Liberal Senators Guilfoyle and Martin, and Labor Senators Coleman and Melzer. Senator Walters from Tasmania was also elected in 1975. So there were six … Across Kings Hall in the House of Representatives there were no women … There was no woman leader or minister in any state parliament … Margaret Guilfoyle became the first, and sole, female cabinet minister in the Fraser Government.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Her election was greeted with much media interest, mainly emphasising her gender, her age, her hair colour, her marital status—she was divorced—her physical size and her motherhood. There was very little, if any, commentary on her political agenda or policy interests and experience.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Susan joined the shadow ministry not long after she joined the parliament. She was a passionate and highly articulate debater and used her time in the Senate to great effect. Her central objective of economic independence for all guided her many achievements as Labor's first female cabinet minister in the Hawke government. Susan's view was that economic independence meant the capacity to provide for your own needs and the needs of those for whom you are directly responsible.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">She began her work in two key areas: tackling discrimination against women, lifting the high school retention rate and increasing funding and places at universities and TAFEs. Just as we take the increased participation and leadership of women in politics and other spheres for granted now, we also assume nearly all high school students will complete year 12. In the years leading up to Susan Ryan being sworn in as Minister for Education and Youth Affairs in 1983, the high school retention rate in my home state of Tasmania was 27 per cent. Nearly three-quarters of Tasmanian high school students in the early 1980s did not complete Year 12. Susan took a proposal to the National Economic Summit in 1983 that this appallingly low rate needed to be lifted to at least two-thirds by 1990. This was overwhelmingly achieved in most states and territories. What flowed from this was an increased demand for places in universities and TAFEs—a cause she also advanced with passion. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, Susan Ryan is remembered for her pioneering sex discrimination bill and the affirmative action bill. Her work highlighting the impact of government and policy decisions on women began much earlier than that. In 1981, from opposition, Susan made a detailed analysis of the effect of the budget on women and published it. From this the Women's Budget Statement was born. The first official publication of the statement was produced by the Office of the Status of Women in 1984. Her statement announcing this was met with much derision from some of the then opposition. In fact, the first time the Liberal Party embarked on a similar process was when Dr John Hewson was Leader of the Opposition.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After she left her successful political career, Susan Ryan went on to have an equally successful role in publishing, superannuation and industry. Her great friend Wendy McCarthy says of Susan and her work: 'Every 10 years or so she would change careers, and we would all follow her and support her. You couldn't help but get caught up with her enthusiasm for reform and change, her generosity and her great sense of fun.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to her paid roles, Susan Ryan threw her enthusiasm and commitment into the Australian Republic Movement. In more recent times, Australians got to know Susan as our first Age Discrimination Commissioner. She brought all the attributes Wendy McCarthy identified and combined them with her deep knowledge and understanding of government and its processes to advocate for real change for older Australians. For a short time she was also Disability Discrimination Commissioner.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Although her role as Age Discrimination Commissioner ended in 2016, Susan's advocacy for older Australians didn't. She was a frequent panellist on television and would happily use whatever platform was offered to highlight her concerns about the treatment of older Australians. In 1990 Susan was appointed an Officer of the Order of Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As with any political career, hers wasn't all smooth sailing, but it was one of incredible achievement. Her friends, colleagues and many associates remember Susan as frighteningly intelligent, politically savvy, funny, optimistic and committed. Susan Ryan really was the life of the Labor Party during her time in parliament. Generations of Australians, particularly women, have and will follow where she led thanks to her commitment to equality and education reforms, and that is her legacy. From the time of her community involvement until her untimely death, Susan was a true feminist.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Some time ago, someone asked her about post-feminism. In typical Susan style she replied:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I struggle with post-modernism in architecture, literature and literary criticism and I think that post-feminism is uncalled for.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Along with all the members of the federal parliamentary Labor Party, I extend my condolences to Susan's partner, Rory, her two children and her extended family and friends. Can I also place on record my thanks to them for sharing Susan with the Labor Party, the wider Labor movement and our nation.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="140651" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator O'NEILL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:28</span>):  Thank you for the opportunity to rise today and speak on the sudden and tragic passing of former senator Susan Ryan AO, former Hawke cabinet minister—indeed, Labor's first female cabinet minister. She was a pioneer in every sense. She broke that glass ceiling in the territory, in this party and in so many areas of civic life following her retirement from politics. And she was a loving and proud mum and grandma as well. To her family I want to say I'm so sorry for your great loss and I thank you for your great generosity in sharing her with the nation, whose history she changed. I want to associate myself also with the remarks of those who've contributed to this condolence motion this afternoon, and I think Senator Wong's framing of the life of Susan Ryan as a critical driver of significant historical change is a very accurate summary of the powerful, powerful impact that Susan Ryan had on our nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Born in Sydney in 1942, Susan grew up in the great Labor suburb of Maroubra, achieving a BA at Sydney Teachers College before working as a school teacher, a small-business owner and a second secretary at the Australian embassy in Vienna. After moving to Canberra, she graduated with a Master of Arts degree from ANU and became a foundational member of the Belconnen branch of the ALP and the Women's Electoral Lobby—one of countless political actions she would take for the empowerment of Australian women. She was subsequently elected to the ACT House of Assembly in 1975 before becoming one of the first two senators for the ACT, elected on that much repeated mantra that has featured in the speeches this afternoon, the unabashedly feminist statement: 'A woman's place is in the House and the Senate and everywhere decisions are made.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">She made history as a 33-year-old single mother and eight years later would change history as a pivotal member of the Hawke government. In her role as a cabinet minister she was able to make the changes for women that were so desperately needed at that time. When Hawke was elected in 1983 she was made Minister for Education and Youth Affairs and the first ever minister for the status of women. She wasted no time and soon set about tearing down the barriers that Australian women had faced for generations. Her landmark work was, of course, the Sex Discrimination Act 1984, which sought to eliminate so far as is possible discrimination against persons on the grounds of sex, marital status and pregnancy or potential pregnancy in the areas of work; accommodation; education; the provision of goods, facilities and services; the disposal of land; the activities of clubs; and the administration of Commonwealth laws and programs. This wide-ranging act ensured that the rights of women were protected by legislation. It was a giant step forward for women all across the country. This act, along with the Affirmative Action (Equal Employment Opportunity for Women) Act, embodied the greatest beliefs of the Labor movement, that through fair and equitable employment in a fair and equitable society humanity can flourish and people can build a life worth living.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Her tenure as education minister was no less successful, with Paul Keating remarking that her great achievement was to lift year 10 retention rates in schools, which was an abysmal three in 10 when she took office in 1983, to end at nine in 10 in 1996. This included the doubling of the number of female graduates from high school. This surely helped pave the way for the economic successes that flowed in the decades after the Hawke and Keating era as a whole generation of young Australian women transitioned through that schooling into the jobs of the future. Even after she left parliament she continued to break ground, as others have said, serving as the first Age Discrimination Commissioner, as Disability Discrimination Commissioner and as President of the Australian Institute of Superannuation Trustees, while continuing to campaign for an Australian republic and an Australian bill of rights.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Her life was also marked with a long affiliation with her Irish heritage. Like myself, she was an Australian of Irish flavour, Catholic and Labor. She remarked that her lifelong desire for social justice was kindled due to the strong values based teaching she received at a Brigidine school in Sydney. The Brigidines are a teaching order of nuns founded in Ireland in the 19th century who contributed significantly to Catholic education in Australia. Several decades later Susan was awarded the lifetime achievement of the Brigid Award by the Irish Labor friendship women's group in 2016—indeed, she was the inaugural awardee of that award named after St Brigid, whose values and philosophy inspired the Brigidine nuns who taught Susan. Her love of the Irish people was profound. I'm advised my good friend Dermot Ryan, who I know is a good friend also of Senator Tony Sheldon, is preparing an obituary for <span style="font-style:italic;">The Irish Times</span>. Susan's family tree connects her back to County Wexford. This is an important thing for Irish people: it's not enough just to be from Ireland; you have to be from a particular county.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Even in later life, Susan joined the annual Irish Winter School in Sydney to learn the Irish language—in order, she said, to be able to fit in when she visited the country. She championed the project to erect a monument in Sydney to the Irish Great Famine, which commemorated the thousands of Irish women who escaped the famine by emigrating to Australia, and she spoke at the fifth annual commemoration ceremony in 2004. Susan was also a member and a speaker at the Aisling Society, an Irish-Australian cultural group. She was a frequent supporter and patron of O'Punsky's Theatre Company in Sydney, and in 2019 she was named one of the top 100 Irish Australians of all time by the <span style="font-style:italic;">Irish Echo</span>—up there with Paul Keating, Ben Chifley and John Curtin.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not surprising that the last conversation I had with Susan Ryan, earlier this year, was at an Irish event around St Patrick's Day. It was to mark the 20th year of the presence of the Irish consulate in Sydney and was convened by the Consul General there, Owen Feeney. It was to celebrate 20 historical Australian-Irish figures. As she always did, Susan took the time to talk to everyone in the room. She took me aside and, as she had done on many occasions, encouraged me, supported me and understood me as only a woman in the great Labor Party can.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Susan's legacy will be felt by generations of Australians to come, and her example will shine to all Australian women. Her work will live on as the best example of Australians' belief in a fair go for all, no matter the circumstances of your birth. She was a credit to this chamber, to the great Australian Labor Party and to the nation. I echo the words of the Brigidine Sisters, who gave their thanks across the Brigidine international network last week for Susan's rich life and for her public service to Australia. I, like them, offer my sincere sympathy to her family and friends. Vale Susan Ryan: you are already missed.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="I0T" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator PRATT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:36</span>):  Today I rise along with many others to make some personal remarks and to pay tribute to the wonderful Susan Ryan. The strength of her legacy is immeasurable and it is indelible in my own life as I reflect on being a young woman completing her high school education in the 1980s, with that lift in retention rates across the country for girls—and, indeed, young working-class men—in particular. Along with that came a much greater diversity of subjects which we could study and a greatly improved quality of education that indeed has had a long-term legacy. My mother had great respect for Susan Ryan. My mother, Sandra, was also an early member of the Women's Electoral Lobby. As a woman, she struggled with being unable to get a home loan in her own name and being paid less than men, at a lower hourly rate within the same profession.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For me as a woman in the Labor Party—as someone who joined in the early 1990s, at the end of Susan's parliamentary career—she was indeed an inspiration for me to join the great Australian Labor Party. But my own knowledge of Susan comes through my work in this place, in particular from her work at the Australian Human Rights Commission as the Age Discrimination Commissioner. Her enormous capacity to understand intersecting human rights debates has been of great benefit to the nation right from her participation in these debates in the 1960s and 1970s through to her work as Age Discrimination Commissioner.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">She made some remarks while she was the Age Discrimination Commissioner at an event called the Australian Homosexual Histories Conference back in 2014. She said there, in good humour:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I am in some senses an unlikely candidate as an advocate for homosexual law reform. As a young heterosexual woman coming of age in post war Australia, educated in a strict and conservative catholic environment, I really didn't know much about homosexuality until well into adulthood. In fact we were not taught much about sexuality in general (our own or anyone else's). In this sense I was very much the product of my generation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">She went on to talk about how she became involved in debates in gay law reform here in the ACT in very early votes in the 1970s to decriminalise homosexuality—and, indeed, also in abortion law reform debates here. So she was active not just in sex discrimination but in disability discrimination and in sexuality and gender identity discrimination throughout her career.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the Age Discrimination Commissioner, she was at the Human Rights Commission at a very important point in time for the LGBTI community, when this parliament, under the Labor government, considered the reforms to the Sex Discrimination Act, to amend the Sex Discrimination Act so that it not only covered sex discrimination but covered sexuality, gender identity and intersex discrimination. I'm very grateful that Susan was the Age Discrimination Commissioner at the time, because she was really able to help see the enabling of the exemptions to the Sex Discrimination Act being lifted out of aged care so that you can no longer discriminate against someone because of their sexual orientation, gender identity or intersex status in aged-care services and facilities here in Australia. This is a principle that needs to extend across all Commonwealth and community services so that there aren't exemptions to any primary service that it should be someone's right to access.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am profoundly grateful for the inspiration of Susan Ryan's life. As I have listened to people today talk about her colour and vibrancy as a person, I'm also reminded how deep she had to dig to continue that work. It's great inspiration to me in a tough week and on a tough day in politics in this chamber to know that you can really see what a difference one person can make to our national fabric.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Australian Greens Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:42</span>):  I will be brief, because people have said so many wonderful things about Susan Ryan. I'd, firstly, like to offer my condolences to Susan's family, friends and colleagues.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll be so bold as to say that every woman in Australia has benefited from the work that Susan Ryan did. I think there are a number of young women today that still don't really get or believe that some women were forced to resign when they got married and that some women had to get their sons to go guarantor for loans. Nowadays younger women appreciate that strides have been made, but they don't get that people like Susan put so much effort into achieving those changes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I wanted to go to some of the work I did with Susan Ryan when she was the Age Discrimination Commissioner. I believe that she carried on the excellent work that she did in this place and in many other places as the Age Discrimination Commissioner. She was the inaugural commissioner, and she really got how older people were—and still are—being discriminated against in many areas, including in aged care. I was part of that discussion, having been the aged-care spokesperson on those issues and having worked with some very close friends in Western Australia on that particular issue as well. So I'd like to particularly comment on that, but also on employment in general. This is why the work that Susan was doing is so important right now—the discrimination that is still going on for older workers and particularly for older women workers. They are the fastest-growing cohort of those who are unemployed. They are ageing into poverty as older women not being able to find work on very low income support payments. They are ageing into poverty as they wait to be able to move onto the aged pension, using up all their savings. It's absolutely imperative that these issues are dealt with, and Susan knew that. She was working on that. She held forums, and I attended some of those, on how to work with business and with employers to ensure that older workers are taken on. She was always raising those issues about older women.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then, as has also been pointed out, she became the Disability Discrimination Commissioner. Again, I had a related portfolio at the time. Susan took the same gusto to disability discrimination issues as well. Not only did we have a number of discussions—and Susan was very active throughout the country—but I asked her questions across the estimates table when she was commissioner. She was always very glad to talk about the issues across the estimates table.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Susan Ryan made an enormous contribution to this country—particularly to the women of this country. She'll be remembered for all the work that she did. There are some things from your childhood and your young adulthood that you take with you your whole life, and throughout my life I have taken with me the work that she did. It was an honour to be able, just to a small degree, to work with her on these really important issues. Vale Susan Ryan; you won't be forgotten.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator URQUHART</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:47</span>):  All of us women of the Senate stand here on the shoulders of a magnificent woman, Susan Maree Ryan. When she was elected to one of the two newly created ACT Senate seats in 1975, as everyone in this place has said, she campaigned on the slogan, 'A woman's place is in the Senate.' And it is. In fact, the only Labor senators from Tasmania are women. We're all women. How very pleased she must have been when the Senate finally achieved gender equality a little over a year ago. How much we owe her.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many adjectives have been used to describe Susan, whose Senate career from 1975 to 1986 was only part of a long and multifaceted working life dedicated to equality and human rights. She's been described as a luminary, a fierce champion, a trailblazer, a feminist hero and a Labor giant. She was all these things and more, and she will be remembered as a fierce champion for women's rights and other discriminated Australians after her sudden death just 11 days ago.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those before me have outlined her groundbreaking positions and work as a minister in the Hawke government, so I won't go over that. Labor leader Anthony Albanese said that she changed Australia for the better, and I do agree with that. This is something that we must all aspire to. In her lifetime, she saw and influenced incredible changes. We must not forget a world where women were pilloried for seeking elected office, where women could be sacked simply for falling pregnant, where equal pay was a faraway dream, where the idea of a woman taking up a blue-collar trade or becoming a CEO was unheard of, and, in fact, shunned. Rights for older Australians and those living with disability were barely imaginable. Many of these things that we today take for granted were issues which were championed by Susan, and she stood up to years of vilification because of this work. Paul Keating said her great achievement was to set in motion the lifting of year 12 retention rates from three in 10 in 1983 to nine in 10 by 1996. This revolutionised education in Australia most particularly for girls, he said—and he was correct.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The best thing all 39 of us, all today's women senators, can do is to pledge that we will pursue her legacy. We will confront the obstacles and rise above them. We owe Susan Ryan a debt that is best paid by redoubling our commitment to equality for all Australians—a commitment to not seeing older workers thrown on the trash heap because of a recession, to not seeing Australians with disability ignored and denied opportunities and resources, to ensuring that discrimination does not hobble the lives of Australian women and to ensuring that, regardless of your sexual orientation, gender, cultural background, ethnicity, age and ability, you get a fair go in this country we love.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to personally thank Susan Ryan not because I knew her well but because without her example—her voice, her steady hand and her carefully considered and articulate arguments—I simply might not be here and my daughter and hundreds of thousands of Tasmanian women, older Tasmanians and Tasmanians living with disability might not have the education and opportunities they have today. In saying that, I note that the job is not done. With recession upon us and so many young Australians wondering where they will find a place in life, with so many older Australians worried about being left out of the workforce and others frightened that their retirement and old age may not be one where they will have the resources to allow them to live with dignity and receive the care they need, with so many Australians living with disability still denied the opportunity to fully participate in society, with Indigenous Australians still denied the voice and opportunity that is rightfully theirs, and with the cost of obtaining an education moving out of reach for many and the cost of child care leaving many women unable to carve out a career of their dreams, there is still so much more to struggle for and to win. We will do that with our path illuminated by the bright light held in Susan Ryan's steady, intelligent and guiding hands. My sincere condolences to her partner, Rory Sutton, her children and all who loved her.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="168275" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SHELDON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:52</span>):  I rise today to honour the life of Susan Ryan, architect of the world-leading Sex Discrimination Act, first female Labor cabinet minister and icon for social justice in Australia. She was the woman who, as education minister, more than doubled the high school retention rate, including for girls. She was one of our best fighters. It says volumes about her values and capacity when you look at the fact she worked so hard for the rights of humanity—women and men, able and disabled, and most recently older Australians and Australians living with disability—as Age Discrimination Commissioner and Disability Discrimination Commissioner, and was a major ally to increasing the voice of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders and young people. How sorry we are that we don't get to hear her views this week on the coalition's federal budget—the two biggest failings of which are the ignoring of the impact of this recession on women and on older workers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Susan Ryan died suddenly last week. We should never forget what she has done for all Australians by making our society fairer, more inclusive and more willing to back in the aspirations of all women and men, and their families. She lived a life of firsts. Her Irish working-class parents, Florence and Arthur, worked as a sales assistant and as a public servant respectively. She was the first in her family to go to university. She was the first in her school to win a scholarship to university. It is a stark reminder to all of us of how unequal our society was at the time that she was forced to pay back that scholarship because she got married. We should all remember that it was not long ago that all women had to resign from the Public Service when they got married and could be fired from any job when they became pregnant. She was also, of course, the first female member of a Labor cabinet when she joined the Hawke cabinet in 1983 as education and youth affairs minister.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Even when she left the parliament, she kept fighting for the rights and power of working people. She was Deputy Chair of the Australian Republican Movement from 2000 to 2003, and of course there was her important work on strengthening superannuation. In her seven years as the President of the Australian Institute of Superannuation Trustees until 2007, she fought for the right of all Australians to have access to a dignified retirement and for super funds to continue to play a role in democratising financial systems in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have come a long way since the 1950s and 1960s, when Susan Ryan was educated in the Brigidine Catholic college in Sydney's eastern suburbs, where her passion for social justice was encouraged and where she was a brilliant debater and a fearless advocate for her schoolmates. We must never forget how hard it was to get even basic employment protections for women and how stubborn inequalities persist in Australia still, like the gender pay gap and the harassment and discrimination experienced by women every day in our workplaces and institutions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to say something about the dogged activism of Susan Ryan as well. She was a respected legislator and a pragmatic political operator, but her pragmatism and her wily role in cabinet were first and foremost in the service of her ideals. She did not court power for its own sake. She focused on outcomes, and she often clashed with her cabinet colleagues on points of principle. She worked hard across the factions and across the aisle to give all working people real power to shape their own destinies. She was also loved for her sense of humour. In Susan's memoirs, <span style="font-style:italic;">Catching the Waves: Life In and Out of Politics</span>, she said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I am by temperament quite gregarious, but the combination of my gender and my politics meant that the position I occupied most often was that of a shag on a rock.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">However, now, due to her determination and drive, she is no longer isolated, and there are many people who adored her, share her views and are determined to continue her accomplishments.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to share an anecdote from a good friend of mine whom Susan was also a good mate of, Dermot Ryan; my colleague mentioned Dermot before. He is a very active person in the Irish Labor groups within Australia and has just recently written a tribute to Susan in which he said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">But what really stood out was our shared memories of her warmth and her sense of fun and mischief. At social events, she moved seamlessly from singing a hymn to singing The Internationale. She was a committed Australian republican and was also an Irish republican. Whenever we met, she would cheekily address me as "Comrade Ryan, my favourite Irish Unionist", (her knowing full well that 'Unionist' has a very different meaning in Australia to Ireland). My own late Mother having shared her name, I would retort "Hello there—my 2nd favourite Susan Ryan".</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A fighter for a just society for women and men, Susan Ryan has earnt a place in the hearts of the Labor movement and all Australians. I offer my condolences and solidarity to her family and friends. Vale Susan Ryan.</span>

But nevertheless I have a place in the Labor Party.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Susan Ryan was first and foremost a feminist. She was a trailblazer, an activist and a republican. She was the first in so many fields but none, in my view, as important as being elected as the first female senator for the ACT and going on to be the first woman in the Hawke cabinet. Indeed, when I joined the party in the early eighties, Susan Ryan was there, and she was someone that I looked up to in this place all the way from Western Australia. I looked at her in awe. But nevertheless she showed us, as women in the Labor Party, that there was a place for us, because we could see what we could be.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">She was truly amazing. The bills that she introduced—the Sex Discrimination Bill, in particular—have stood women in good stead and have enabled women to really advance in our society. But it is sad, as a number of people have reflected, that we've still got a long way to go. As a feminist in the Labor Party, Susan certainly made pathways for the rest of us. She would have applauded the fights that we had to get our affirmative action policies in place, and today she would have been honoured when our leader, Mr Albanese, dedicated Labor's budget statement to Susan Ryan. She was the first to have a particular budget statement for women and today, when we launched our statement, it was in honour of Susan Ryan.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I met Susan in her role as the Age Discrimination Commissioner when I was the National Assistant Secretary of United Workers Union and had responsibility for aged care. She was just as strident there as she was as a member of the Hawke cabinet. Yes, she was warm, and that certainly came across, but she was fierce in her advocacy. I would like to end my contribution by paying my most sincere condolences to Rory, her partner, and to her children Justine and Ben. Most of all, I say thank you to Susan Ryan for being that feminist, for paving the way for other Labor women.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Australian Capital Territory</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:01</span>):  I rise as the almost final speaker on this condolence motion for the Hon. Susan Ryan AO and to associate myself with all of the previous contributions that have been so lovely and comforting in the sudden and tragic passing of Susan within the last fortnight. Susan was not the first woman in this place but she was a woman of many firsts. She was the first Labor senator for the ACT, the first Labor woman appointed to a frontbench position, the first Labor woman appointed to a ministry and, of course, the first Labor woman to enter cabinet. She achieved all of these firsts in what was firmly a man's world, joining the federal parliament at a time when there were only six women, and all were in the Senate. I can only imagine what that was like for her. For me, as a woman in politics, Susan didn't just pave the way. She actually built the pathway that so many women have now taken not only to this place in Australia's national parliament but to so many places—community organisations, unions, businesses. She proved to us that there was a seat at the table for all of us.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's really hard to describe or measure just how much trailblazers or pioneers of the women's movement like Susan Ryan have changed our country for the better. Her achievements, of which there were so many, were vast. Her influence in the parliament for 12 years, her life post politics where she kept doing what she'd always done—applying herself to every cause she championed with more than 100 per cent of her energy, bringing people with her, forming coalitions and, really importantly, being strategic about the pathway to victory and the pathway to lasting change. She campaigned for equality for women, for older Australians, for education for all. She was a staunch feminist in the Senate at a time when a lot of people, including some of her own caucus members, probably didn't know what that meant. She formed her political aspirations from second-wave feminism and she knew that women's inequality required a political solution that would be best enacted by women themselves.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Before her parliamentary career, she sought to impact political decision-making by helping to form the Women's Electoral Lobby and later became an effective part of the 1972 electoral campaign. In her own words, this lobbying was necessary but not sufficient. It left women on the outside of political power, waiting, persuading, threatening but not acting directly to achieve change. How much more efficient, how much more effective it would be if women were in there making the decisions themselves instead of knocking on the doors trying to attract support.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Debate on the ill-fated Lamb-McKenzie abortion reform bill in 1973 exemplified the problem. The debate was conducted in an all-male chamber while the women that this law was to affect were outside rallying, organising, shouting through loudhailers, preparing themselves for disappointment. Susan decided that, next time, she would be in there making the laws. In 1975 she was elected on the famed slogan 'A woman's place is in the House and in the Senate'. But that was just a subset of a much larger mission for Susan, which was that a woman's place was at the table where all the decisions were being made. She became Minister for Education and Youth Affairs when Bob Hawke was elected to office in 1983, and was tasked with the first portfolio on the status of women. At the time—and many speakers have reflected on this—women were unlikely to be approved for home loans; faced limited maternity leave provisions, if any; and were able to have their employment legally terminated on account of marital status or falling pregnant. Susan Ryan sought to change this, with her central objective for parliament being to achieve economic independence for all, including women.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Perhaps there is no greater example of the nation-builder that she was than in her pivotal role in two landmark acts—the Sex Discrimination Act and the Affirmative Action (Equal Employment Opportunity for Women) Act. Later in life, she described her advocacy on the Sex Discrimination Act as 'probably the most useful thing she had done in her life'. Today, whilst not perfect by any means, we do generally live in a society that accepts that discrimination on the basis of gender is unlawful. But that wasn't the case during Susan's time in this place. She, along with her Labor colleagues, some of whom she'd had to convince, set about to change that. Again, I can only imagine the pushback that came to her from some—both personally and professionally—from waging the campaign that that would have brought on. The nation was changing. Change is always difficult, and she was there helping that change come about.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But it would be wrong to simply describe Susan as a trailblazing pioneer feminist. She was of course that, but she was so much more. She was an activist, an organiser, an educator, a senator, a mentor, a proud republican, a partner, a mother, a grandmother and a dear friend to so many. She was a community campaigner, a fighter for equality across the board, an advocate for older Australians and a friend of First Nations. She joined organisations, and if they didn't exist she started them. She was the proud founder of the Belconnen sub-branch of the ACT Labor Party and, as I said, she was a founding member of WEL. She created communities of like-minded people and set about delivering the change that was needed. She drafted laws and campaigned for them; importantly, she brought people with her, and those laws passed. The impact of her work in this place is enduring.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To me as a single mum wanting to get involved in politics, Susan Ryan showed me that not only could it be done but it must be done, that there was an expectation on us to get involved and that it was only by getting involved that change happened. She, along with Joan Kirner, told me that women like me can't vacate the field; we have to step up. They convinced me, a single mother, that it was an asset, not a disadvantage, to bring my background to politics and that I would be a better politician because of it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You always knew when Susan was in the room, because she had a presence. It was something that was hard to pin down, but it was welcoming, supportive, kind, strong, principled, determined and focused—and she was always present. She managed to project all of that at the one time. It's hard to believe that we won't get to be in the same room with her anymore, but we are given strength and comfort in our knowledge that her reforms, her influence, her legacy and the things she changed remain all around us, guiding us and reminding us of the unfinished work before us.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To Susan's partner, her family, her children, her grandchildren and so many of her friends who have spoken over the past 11 days or so and are deeply grieving at the moment and remain devastated by her passing, I extend my sincere condolences.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="ZN4" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator HENDERSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:09</span>):  I would like to rise and add my voice to this condolence motion for the Hon. Susan Ryan AO, and I'd like to associate myself with the many wonderful remarks in this condolence motion. As a senator, as the first woman to hold a cabinet role in a federal Labor government, as Minister for Education and Youth Affairs and as Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women in the Hawke government and, later, as Special Minister of State, Susan Ryan was indeed a trailblazer. I remember the mark that she made when I was a young girl and a young journalist during the time she successfully steered through the passage of the Sex Discrimination Act.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, much has changed in the Australian Senate since Susan Ryan was elected in 1975. My swearing-in as a senator in October last year marked the first time that the number of female senators reached 50 per cent. When Susan Ryan was elected, there were only a handful of women senators. In the wake of the tumultuous dismissal of the Whitlam government, she was elected as one of the ACT's two senators. Observing her from afar, as I did, I always got the impression that she was much more of a warrior for women and education than for party politics. I think this was to her great credit and also, of course, very much to her legacy. Her election pitch, as we've heard so often in this debate, was, 'A woman's place is in the House and the Senate and everywhere that decisions are made.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to particularly acknowledge Susan Ryan's work in the area of sex discrimination. In November 1981, Susan introduced a private senator's bill to outlaw sexual discrimination. The bill did not pass, but it did pave the way for the Sex Discrimination Bill, which was passed eventually in 1983. The Sex Discrimination Bill embodied half of Susan Ryan's 1981 private bill, seeking to prevent discrimination on the basis of sex, marital status or pregnancy. It also contained provisions outlawing sexual harassment in the workplace and in educational institutions and provided for redress against individual acts of discrimination. It is, of course, quite difficult to imagine an era where sex discrimination was not actively prohibited. It was a time, of course, when there was very substantial systemic discrimination levied against women in all sectors of Australian society, whether it be a situation where women were refused a bank loan because they were women, or whether they lost a job because they became pregnant, or whether they were refused entry to or service in a hotel. Even joining the Nippers movement as a young surf lifesaver was not an option for girls. Surf lifesaving clubs did not even allow women to join as members until 1980, which is now something that young girls and women could not possibly comprehend.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Susan Ryan was a successful champion of causes, and her achievements were very considerable. Apart from combating sex discrimination, she oversaw increased funding for women's refuges and for child care, as well as an increase in the retention rate of year 12 from 35 per cent to 53 per cent during the first four years of the Hawke government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After leaving parliament, Susan Ryan took on a number of private sector roles before she served as pro-chancellor for the University of New South Wales. She went on to be deputy chair of the Australian Republic Movement. In July 2011 she was appointed Australia's first Age Discrimination Commissioner, and in 2014 she was appointed Disability Discrimination Commissioner.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I wish to convey my sincere condolences to her family and friends. I wish to acknowledge the wonderful contribution that Susan Ryan made to this place and to the betterment of our country, particularly for Australian women. Vale Susan Ryan.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On 3 September 2020 the Senate agreed to a resolution moved by the Leader of the Government in the Senate and the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate affirming the right of the Senate to determine its meetings and meetings of its committees. The resolution reminded state and Commonwealth executive officers to have regard to the powers, privileges and immunities of the Senate and senators in devising and implementing public health measures. Wherever possible, where such measures affect the capacity of senators to undertake their parliamentary duties they should be developed in consultation with representatives of the Senate. The resolution referred consequential matters to the Procedure Committee.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The report I have tabled today records the committee's oversight of arrangements to ensure that the sittings and estimates hearings scheduled for the remainder of the year can proceed in a COVID-safe manner. As part of those arrangements the committee endorsed the continued application of the rules for remote participation during the budget week sitting, and noted that estimates hearings were also expected to make extensive use of video participation by both senators and witnesses. Final arrangements would be a matter for committees themselves.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The report also identified several operational matters as critical to ensuring that the scheduled estimates hearings proceed in a safe manner, and the committee is overseeing the development of appropriate protocols for senators, staff and witnesses, implementing current health advice. The committee will continue to have a watching brief over these matters as long as it's necessary.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator POLLEY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:18</span>):  I rise to speak to the tabling of the interim report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Australia's Family Law System in my capacity as a member of that committee. The interim report contains a comprehensive review of the evidence the committee has heard to date. The committee has received a significant amount of evidence covering many issues facing family law in Australia. A total of 1,692 submissions have been received, and the committee has heard from 64 organisations and professionals and 85 individuals, in 11 public hearings. We've also held 13 in camera hearings. The committee has continued its work, although it hasn't been able to travel, for obvious reasons, during this pandemic.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On 31 August 2020 both houses of parliament agreed to extend the reporting date for this inquiry to the last sitting day in February 2021. The committee felt that it would be timely to table an interim report, providing the parliament and the community with an update on the committee's work. The interim report is comprehensive, running to 12 chapters and over 300 pages. This is reflective of the breadth of issues that have been raised within the community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some of the key issues explored in the report included perceptions of bias within the system, the role of family consultants and expert witnesses, legal fees and the costs of the family law system, delays in the Family Court and issues in relation to family violence. The report also considers issues arising in parenting and property disputes. There is so much in terms of the evidence that has been brought before the committee that you can't help but be touched by the emotional and the psychological impact that a dispute going through the family law courts unfortunately has on all those involved, particularly children.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an area of law which is not only complex but highly emotional and draining for individuals and families. When relationships break down and families separate, often the family law system works to ensure the most appropriate outcome for the parties involved. But, from the evidence that we've received, I don't believe there's any family that ends up in the Family Court that isn't permanently scarred by the experience. It is extremely expensive, it's costly and it's time consuming. The personal stories of pain and anguish were not lost on any members of the committee, and I'd just like to, at this point in time, thank all of those who are on this select committee, because it has been an enduring commitment to continue this inquiry through this COVID pandemic.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that this committee should never have really existed though. That's the reality. This committee was formed as part of a political deal that was done. We know that there have been countless reports into the family law system in this country. In the last two years alone there has been a report sitting on the Attorney-General's desk and the Prime Minister's desk, with 93 recommendations on how to improve the family law system in this country, but nothing has happened. Like so many reports that are done by fantastic committees and secretaries who put countless hours and weeks and months into these inquiries, those recommendations just sit and gather dust. This is the time to actually act, to change, to invest in and to properly resource the family law system in this country. While we can make recommendation after recommendation, if there is not the will of the parliament and there is not the will of the government, nothing will happen. But it must happen.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to make my perspective very clear: it is very hard when allegations are made in evidence, as given to committees, when you only ever hear one side of that particular story. It is confronting to hear the tragedies, the heartache and the pain that is caused through relationships breaking down. A lot of the time the contributions made by witnesses were heart-wrenching and touched people through to their souls, in my view. When I was first put onto this committee, we were all advised that there would be counselling available for committee members and for witnesses, and I, for one, thought, 'Well, that won't really be necessary,' but I understand now why people do need counselling. This is such an important area of law in this country that affects not just individual families and extended families; it also affects our communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd also like to put on the record an issue from my home state of Tasmania. I live in Launceston. Mark Dreyfus from the other place, the shadow Attorney-General, and I and others have been lobbying for many years to have improvements done to the Launceston family law court. And finally, in this budget—I commend the government for finally, after too many years I might add, doing this. My concern still is that this funding is over four years. I would urge the government to do everything that it can to ensure that the new family law court in Launceston makes that transition as soon as possible because the benefits, as I said, go way beyond those individual families which go through the court system. Those who sit on the bench, their lawyers and advocates—everyone—will benefit if that court can be relocated as soon as possible.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But I just don't want to see the $5.4 million over four years for the relocation happening and then find that we're back here in a few years, asking, 'When is that going to happen?' So I urge those people on the other side to join with me in urging that the relocation happens sooner rather than later.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">On behalf of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, I present this statement on the draft budget estimates of the Australian National Audit Office—the ANAO—and the Parliamentary Budget Office—the PBO.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Committee is required, under the <span style="font-style:italic;">Public Accounts and Audit Committee Act 1951</span> and the <span style="font-style:italic;">Parliamentary Service Act 1999</span>, to consider the draft budget estimates of the ANAO and the PBO, and make recommendations including to both Houses of Parliament regarding these estimates.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The respective Acts of the Auditor-General and the Parliamentary Budget Officer, as well as the Committee's own legislation, require each of those officers to provide all the information necessary for the Committee to consider their budget estimates.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">With regard to the Parliamentary Budget Office, the Committee has been informed that the PBO has sought supplementation in the 2020-21 Budget.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Committee understands that, since the COVID-19 pandemic, the PBO has focused its research on publications relevant to the current fiscal situation, reflecting a heightened level of interest in publications that inform the Parliament and the public about fiscal matters.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Accordingly, the PBO has sought temporary supplementation of $3.1 million over four years, from the 2020-21 Budget, to maintain and expand its research publication program in light of COVID-19.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Acting Parliamentary Budget Officer has advised the Committee that this supplementary funding would enable the PBO to maintain and expand its research program over the peak period associated with the next election and deliver additional research publications in other non-election years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In the PBO's Budget Submission, the agency requested temporary supplementation for an additional team of five research staff available from the second half of 2020-21 to the end of 2023-24. The total budget impact of this would be $3.1 million over four years, including $0.4 million in 2020-21, and $0.9 million per annum between 2021-22 and 2023-24.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Committee acknowledges the benefit to the Parliament and public discourse of the PBO's research program. The Committee notes that the COVID-19 pandemic has had an impact on many departments and agencies across government, as well as the broader budgetary position, and therefore provides a qualified recommendation in support of the PBO's request for temporary supplementation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">With regard to the Australian National Audit Office, the ANAO has informed the Committee it is seeking supplementation in the 2020-21 Budget over the forward estimates.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The ANAO states that to restore its ability to deliver an appropriate number of performance audits, conduct mandatory financial statement audits, and meet increased costs associated with changes in work patterns due to COVID-19, supplementary budget funding of $6.3 million in 2020-21 is needed. The ANAO has proposed that this would rise over the forward estimates to $9.1 million by 2023-24.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The ANAO has advised that this additional funding would meet IT and data storage costs, improve cyber security measures and meet cost increases in financial statements audits. Further, the funding would assist in increasing the ANAO's internet bandwidth to support remote working arrangements due COVID-19, undertake controls testing for new COVID-19 measures in financial statement audits, and address quality control risks.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The JCPAA is aware that cost pressures have existed for some time, as evidenced by recent ANAO budget outcomes. According to the ANAO's Annual Reports, the agency's operating result in the most recent two financial years was a deficit of $3.117 million in 2019-20 and a deficit of $4.778 million in 2018-19, excluding depreciation and amortisation. The Committee also notes that previous budget statements in 2016-17, 2017-18 and 2018-19 advise that the ANAO was not seeking supplementation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Between 2019-20 and 2023-24, the ANAO's Budget Submission indicated significant rises in depreciation from that in previous years. The ANAO has outlined that these increases predominantly arise from the fit-out of a new building and upgrades to the agency's IT asset base.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The ANAO has advised the Committee that performance audits in 2020- 21 are projected to fall to 42, with further reductions over the forward estimates if supplementary funding is not provided. With the proposed supplementary funding, the ANAO advised the Committee it would return to meeting its annual target of 48 audits per annum by 2023-24. The Committee recognises that the ANAO has had a target of achieving 48 performance audits for several years and requires adequate funding to meet this objective.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Members are also cognisant of the current difficult budgetary environment and the unprecedented impact of the Coronavirus on departments and entities that the ANAO audits, as well as the broader budgetary position.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Acknowledging the difficult fiscal situation, the Committee provides a qualified recommendation in support of the Auditor-General's request for supplementation. The Committee recognises that the Government will determine its view on the Auditor-General's resourcing via the Budget and recommends that sufficient funding be provided to enable the ANAO to meet its KPIs over the forward estimates.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Auditor-General is also seeking an exemption from the efficiency dividend, to not apply to ANAO appropriations from 2020-21 onwards.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Committee's majority recommendation is that the ANAO not be exempt from the efficiency dividend. The Committee acknowledges the argument put by the Auditor-General that as an Officer of the Parliament he should not be subject to the efficiency dividend which provides funds to Executive Government for reallocation to other priorities, however the majority of the Committee is of the view that this measure continues to serve an important role in ensuring efficiencies are generated across a broad range of agencies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Ultimately this is a matter for the government to determine further.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Committee thanks the Auditor-General and the Acting Parliamentary Budget Officer for their work in support of the Parliament and the Committee.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator GREEN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:26</span>):  With the very short amount of time that I have left to comment on this report of the Senate Rural and Regional Affairs and Transport References Committee, I'd like to say that there are some very good recommendations which address both the Queensland government and Australian government. These go to making sure that there is a good relationship and understanding about reef science in the agricultural community, addressing the concerns of the stakeholders who gave evidence before this committee which addressed some of the issues which were raised.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What was very clear from the beginning of this inquiry was that this was a politicised inquiry which was bought through the Senate to try to tee-up a campaign so that the LNP could go out there and try to win votes in Queensland before the Queensland election. That's why we've seen this report tabled today and people from the LNP waiting to speak about this report, because they want to make this a political issue. Can I just say this: science shouldn't be a political issue. We should accept what scientists say, when they have years and years of experience. They have years of experience in an area that is so important for jobs and the economy in Cairns, in Far North Queensland and in the rest of the Queensland economy. We should accept what scientists say when they tell us that water quality impacts on the Great Barrier Reef.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, there were members of the community who were not willing to accept that evidence. So I assume that there will be a dissenting report that goes through the science, tries to dispute it and tries to pretend that some of the senators in this place know better than scientists. But they do not! They do not know better than these scientists. What we have is a report and recommendations that explain to the Senate how we can have people better understand the science of the reef and how desperately important it is to save the Great Barrier Reef, because we know that it supports thousands of jobs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This was a highly politicised inquiry and it's a highly politicised campaign, and it actually led to people saying that there had been a misuse of Senate procedures and the Senate inquiry. What a shameful and damning thing to have been said about what should be an inquiry that looks into the science that protects jobs in Queensland! What an awful thing for someone in the public to say about the Senate or any senator, that someone would misuse Senate procedures to try to politicise what is an incredibly important body of science that has been built up over so many years. The very important question now for Queenslanders is whether they support a government that supports reef jobs or whether they support the LNP opposition, which is planning on ripping up these laws—</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Our economy was already struggling coming into the crisis. Slow growth, flat wages, declining productivity, business investment going backwards, a doubling of debt.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Women have suffered most during the pandemic, but are reduced to a footnote. The best the Government can offer is they can drive on a road.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">And if someone is over 35 they have certainly been left behind.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">This week their wage subsidy was cut.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">In March their wage subsidy disappears.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Then they will compete to get a job with people who will have their wages subsidised.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McKENZIE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Nationals in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:11</span>):  I rise tonight to make a contribution in budget week as National Party Senate leader, noting that today the Deputy Prime Minister handed down a regional statement about how our government budget affects and supports rural and regional Australians, the seven million of us who live, work and love our regions right across our country. What we handed down today, and what he spoke about today, was how this budget shows our government standing with regional Australia through its most difficult time. We started 2020 with bushfires and by coming out of drought. We were then hit by COVID-19. Our government makes a commitment, through the measures outlined in this budget, to stand with them as, together, we face COVID recession. It's a plan that outlines our opportunities going forward and is reminiscent, I think, of the courage and leadership shown by the Menzies-McEwen government post-World War II. I just want to reflect for a moment on the words of Sir John McEwen, Country Party leader during that period:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Australia is one of the few countries in the world that is not only self-sufficient in food and important raw materials but has an export surplus in these things. We have a sophisticated workforce and a sophisticated field of management that enables us, in a highly competitive world, to continue to grow as a manufacturing country. It would be a great mistake if our manufacturing potential were to be neglected or underestimated. So, considering our self-sufficiency in food and materials, our capacity for industrial growth and our tremendous land area capable of absorbing additional population from around the world, I look forward with a high level of confidence to the future of Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These words were said by 'Black Jack' McEwen half a century ago, and it was his vision for our country following a war—leaving Britain behind, taking in immigrants who were fleeing from war-torn Europe. How do we build a nation that is independent, sovereign and prosperous? It is by securing our national security and our economic security, and he chose to do that through pursuing a policy of full employment. If you look at our budget measures handed down this week, they do too. The McCormack-Morrison government are actually pursuing budget measures that seek to get more Australians back into employment, because we know that is how to drive an economy, and to ensure our economic security and our prosperity going forward.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">'Black Jack' McEwen's vision of and high confidence in a strong and prosperous future for Australia is something that we, in the Nationals, absolutely share, and we fundamentally believe the regions are going to be key to achieving that. As Deputy Prime Minister Michael McCormack outlined today, this week's budget delivers economic security because it delivers jobs, and more than half of those who lost their jobs are already back to work thanks to our measures. The government estimates the economy will recover over 950,000 jobs over the next four years because of the measures—a whole suite of measures across a raft of portfolio areas—delivered on Tuesday night.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Madam Deputy President, 2020 has been a year like no other and now is the time for vision: a sound plan based on sound principles that puts our national sovereignty at its centre. The Nationals in government are investing in regional people and regional businesses. We know that $32 billion in cash flow will boost around 800,000 small businesses. More than 99 per cent of businesses with a turnover of up to $5 billion can write off the full value of any eligible asset they purchase for their business. This is great for them, but it's also great for the suppliers in their local communities that provide those products. This has been a singularly popular measure. I've heard about it over the past two days as farmers and small businesses call in to our offices to say: 'Thank you. It's been tough. This is a real and tangible practical measure that's going to help us pay our bills. That means other businesses keep employing people, but it also will allow us to keep our employees on the payroll.' </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Nationals in government are delivering a record $110 billion in transport infrastructure programs and a $3.5 billion rolling water infrastructure fund to support local jobs and businesses. If you don't come from where we come from, you might not get the relationship between access to water and jobs, productivity and local growth. It is absolutely fundamental to us. With the resilience capacity of our local community and population and with the skills and knowhow grounded in the deep, lived experience of our farming communities, all you need to do is add water out in the regions and we will be a $100 billion ag industry in no time. Just add some workers, Senator McCarthy and Senator McMahon, to get those mangoes off! And we're working on that as well. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As someone who is quite excited about the legacy of Black Jack and the contribution he made and our party made through that period to our national economy and security, I'm getting quite excited about our renewed focus on advanced manufacturing. There is $1.5 billion handed down in this budget over four years for our Modern Manufacturing Strategy. Settle down everyone! This is not 21st-century protectionism; it's actually backing our natural capabilities: food, fibre, minerals, forestry—what a wonderful sustainable industry forestry is. This is around six particular key areas: resources, critical minerals, food and beverages, medical products—we've seen some great examples of this out in regional communities in my home state of Victoria, like Shepparton, where they're actually turning their hand to that PPE task quite quickly—clean energy, and defence and space. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're not wanting this across the board; we're actually wanting to make sure that we are competitive in the areas where we already have a unique competitive advantage. What I love about it is that in over half of these areas of strategic importance the primary product is based in the regions. So the smart thing is also to have that value-adding piece out in the regions too. We need to make Australia make again. We need production lines humming. We did it post World War II. This is a budget that seeks to help us recover in a similar way with a similar sense of optimism and the building of confidence right throughout our community. I'm confident that we can do it. We must focus on our sovereign manufacturing capability. What the pandemic has actually exposed is the fragility of so many supply chains across the globe. I'm really excited about ensuring that we make here at home again things that we might have outsourced—things that are fundamental to ensuring we can feed ourselves, we can keep ourselves safe and we can actually plan with renewed focus on the future. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm very proud to be part of a party in government that is a specialist in one thing and one thing only: working for rural and regional Australia and making sure that those seven million Australians have a proud and very loud voice here in the Senate, in the House and within government to ensure that our road to recovery from COVID-19 backs the regions and backs their natural advantages, and I know that together we can get through this. </span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McKIM</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Leader of the Australian Greens in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:19</span>):  This budget has been delivered in truly exceptional circumstances. We are in the middle of a global pandemic that has hit us hard, but the pandemic has also exposed many pre-existing fault lines in our economy and in our society: insecure work, poverty, privatisation, social isolation and underfunded public services. These times, and this budget, may well be defined by a global pandemic, but even before any of us had heard of COVID-19 we had massive challenges facing us, and those challenges remain today. The earth's climate is breaking down around us. We are living through a mass extinction event. Nature is being destroyed at record pace. The ecological systems that our economy and our society rely on are in crisis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In economic terms, we are also in exceptional circumstances. Interest rates are at the lowest rate in the history of the Federation. Globally, interest rates are at the lowest level in recorded human history. Borrowing money has never been cheaper. Australian households are now carrying more debt than they ever have, and Australia's level of household debt is second in the world only to Switzerland. Yet despite people borrowing more money than ever, more cheaply than ever, homeownership rates are going through the floor. In Australia, homeownership rates are now back to where they were in the 1950s. This is not because people don't want to earn money. Workforce participation is at the highest rate it's ever been. More people than ever are putting their hands up for a job. But wages growth is at the lowest rate since the Australian Bureau of Statistics started keeping records on it in the 1950s.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So we've got wages growth at record lows but we've got the proportion of national income going to company profits at record highs. The end result of all this is that wealth inequality is entrenched, it's significant and it's rising. Record low interest rates, record high household debt, falling homeownership, record workforce participation, record low wages growth, record high company profits, rising wealth inequality—this is what we faced before we entered a global pandemic, and this is what 40-odd years of naked neoliberalism has delivered. More and more people are getting less and less, despite making a greater and greater effort. Meanwhile the big corporations and the super wealthy who own and run them sit back and pocket ever bigger profits and amass ever greater wealth.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Neoliberalism rewards wealth more than it rewards effort. It is a system where the rent seekers rule. It's a system that, instead of repaying the biggest workforce in our country's history with the standard of public infrastructure and public services that a prosperous nation such as ours should share and enjoy, has privatised and deregulated. It's a system that's created gouging monopolies that pay exorbitant dividends to the wealthy few and, at the same time, forces millions of Australians to take on paralysing levels of private debt just to keep their heads above the water. This is a system where if you're not amongst the chosen few you must, to paraphrase Lewis Carroll, run as fast as you can just to stay in place, and to go anywhere you must run twice as fast as that. This is a system where the game is rigged.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Undoubtedly COVID-19 is the trigger for the recession that we're in. But this recession and the pathway to recovery will be made monstrously more difficult for the vast majority of Australians because of the four-decades-long neoliberal assault on the spirit of our country through privatised public utilities, outsourced public services, a mad obsession with budget surpluses, a deregulated industrial relations system, a deregulated financial sector, trade deals that diminish the sovereignty of our country, manufacturing forced offshore, a property market rigged in favour of the speculators, and massive tax breaks for miners and polluters who are pillaging our common wealth and cooking the planet. All of these have been deliberate policy choices of successive Australian governments, starting with the Labor Party, under Hawke and Keating, and supercharged under the Liberals. They have chipped away at the social fabric of our country. They've rewarded the individual at the expense of the collective. They've rewarded capital at the expense of labour. They have wound back the clock on much of the progress that was made in the middle of the last century towards a more equal society and a more shared prosperity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thanks to neoliberalism, we entered the pandemic with an underfunded healthcare system, with an underfunded and privatised childcare system, with an underfunded, privatised and barely regulated aged-care system, with an underfunded education and training system, with 40 per cent of our workforce in insecure work, with entrenched high rates of unemployment and underemployment, with a social safety net set below what people need to survive, and with the most overpriced housing in the world. The pretence of more competition and more choice delivering some kind of market nirvana for people was always a con. Neoliberalism has done to this country what it was always going to do: concentrate wealth and widen the divide between the haves and the have-nots. And all of this has been facilitated by the two major parties that sit in this place today and by an all-powerful financial industry which is a rapacious parasite on our country that has hollowed out the real economy and left behind nothing but a fragile shell. This is why the cheapest money in history is no longer enough. We are truly through the looking glass.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the face of all this, we've got this year's budget. So how does it stack up? Is it a turning point? Is it a not-since-wartime budget? Is it a whatever-it-takes budget? A budget that builds a nation? A budget that gives hope to people? Is it a budget that offers us the hope that we so desperately need that we can live good lives and respect nature and climate? No, of course it's not—not from this Prime Minister, not from this Treasurer, not from this government. This budget is a neoliberal train wreck that will impoverish poor people, steal hopes and dreams from young people, entrench wealth inequality, entrench unemployment and underemployment, and line the pockets of the big corporates and the super rich.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Don't believe the government's budget hype. This budget does nothing to change the structure of the Australian economy or the underlying social, human and natural problems this structure has created. It perpetuates the same old failed, trickle-down, crony capitalist, fake economics rubbish that is simply about big corporations and the super-rich gorging themselves on the hard work of others and rigging the rules to suit themselves. The only difference this time is that it's neoliberalism on tick. But don't be fooled by a new-found tolerance for government debt, because this budget seeks to protect and project the same old neoliberal ideas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government could have used this budget and increased the debt to invest in a shared future, providing the infrastructure, the income support, the jobs and the public services needed to create a cleaner, fairer and more equitable future. It could have used the debt to create jobs in renewable energy, reforestation and rewilding, helping reduce emissions, restore ecosystems and draw down carbon from our atmosphere. But instead it chose to use the debt to further rig the system so that the big corporates and the super-rich can keep making off like bandits while millions of Australians will endure the kind of hardship and poverty that nobody, and I mean nobody, in a nation as rich as ours should ever have to suffer—hardship and poverty that will scar for a lifetime, hardship and poverty that is a stain on our country's history.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a bloody great budget for coal companies and gas companies. It is a magnificent budget for the banks. It is a bonanza for the arms manufacturers. This is a budget by the government's mates, it is a budget for the government's mates and, boy, does this budget deliver for the government's mates and for the government's political donors. But if you are a young person, if you're renting, if you're a woman, if you're First Nations person, if you're unemployed, if you're underemployed, if you're struggling to pay the bills, if you're worried about the climate crisis or if you're worried about the biodiversity crisis, this is not a budget that offers you the hope that you so desperately need.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This budget continues to ignore women. There is no new money to make child care accessible, there is no new money to build affordable public housing and there is no new money to fund frontline domestic violence services, despite 37 women having been killed by violence already this year and rates of domestic violence having increased since the start of the pandemic. Its main selling point—tax cuts—will deliver twice as much money to men as they will to women.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">People working in arts and entertainment were some of the first to be hit by the social-distancing requirements. The sector has suffered tremendously through the lockdown and will be one of the last to recover. It is a sector that gives so much spirit to life in this country, yet the Treasurer could not even find it within himself to utter the word 'art' in his budget speech earlier this week. Arts and entertainment workers were largely excluded from JobKeeper and many are now faced with trying to survive on $40 a day on JobSeeker. Clearly, the $112 billion a year arts and entertainment sector does not matter to the Morrison government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Universities have been literally decimated by this crisis. A full 10 per cent-plus of their workforce is gone, and what's the government's response? Slash support, deliberately and on multiple occasions exclude them from JobKeeper and massively hike the price of getting a degree. There is no new money in this budget for environment conservation and effectively nothing to help protect our threatened native species and natural ecosystems in the middle of the sixth great mass extinction event in our planet's history. There is no serious action to close the gap, a shameful betrayal of promises made just four months ago. Meanwhile, the surveillance state will continue to grow, our rights and liberties will be further eroded and more power will be concentrated into the dangerous hands of the Department of Home Affairs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This budget also turns Australia's back on the world's displaced people. It cuts Australia's humanitarian intake and refugee intake by 20,000 places over the next four years. What is happening to this country? </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This budget gouges almost $1 billion of support for refugees and people seeking asylum, and gives its straight to the big corporates and the super wealthy in tax breaks and $99 billion every year in corporate welfare. And with more than a dash of good, old-fashioned xenophobia and racism, this budget, shamefully, introduces an English language dictation test for partner visas. I'm hearing echoes of the White Australia policy. There is no funding in this budget for the desperately needed federal anticorruption watchdog, and the Liberals have taken revenge on the National Audit Office for exposing sports rorts by slashing its funding.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The centrepiece of this budget is the bringing forward of the stage 2 tax cuts, supported by the Australian Labor Party. That will see millionaires get 2½ thousand bucks a year extra in their pockets and the working poor get 250 bucks a year in their pockets. The unemployed can line up for their regular kick in the teeth; they will get nothing, because a tax cut is worth nothing to you if you haven't got a job. Don't be fooled by the spin. The additional offset for low- and middle-income earners is a one-off; it'll be gone in a year's time. There's a temporary boost for the millions and a permanent boost for the millionaires. And stage 3, which will arrive in four years time—unless it's brought forward in the meantime—is even worse. By that point, the top 10 per cent will be getting 50 per cent of the additional benefit. Stage 3 was voted for by both major parties in this place when it was legislated. Under both stage 2 and stage 3 of these tax cuts, tax cuts that overwhelmingly benefit high-income earners, men get twice the benefit women get. These tax cuts will further entrench gender inequality and further disrespect the massive contribution women have made and continue to make to our country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Borrowing money to give the wealthiest Australians tax cut is, obviously, patently unfair. But it's also really bad economics. There is nothing Keynesian about using the public purse to enrich the already very wealthy. There is nothing smart about tax cuts that leave behind young people, unemployed people and women. These tax cuts will not create jobs. These tax cuts will not trickle down. These tax cuts will not work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">How do we know they won't work? We tried them last year and they didn't work. Last year, when increased tax offsets landed in people's bank accounts, household incomes rose by the highest rate in a decade. But, in the same quarter, household consumption grew by what was then the lowest rate in a decade. Even before we were in recession, people were saving; they weren't spending, because the economy was already stretched to breaking point, as were so many household budgets.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And now that we're in the middle of the greatest economic downturn since the Great Depression, people will obviously do the same again—and more. And fair enough, too! In the face of insecure work, low wage growth, high levels of household debt, high unemployment and massive underemployment, it's the natural thing to do. The point is that tax cuts won't do what the major parties say they are going to do. The money will not make its way out into the economy. The tax cuts simply will not work. And we know that trickle-down economics is one of the world's great political cons: the people at the bottom are dying of thirst waiting for a few drops to reach them. If low- and middle-income earners weren't spending before COVID hit and weren't spending before we got into a recession then high-income earners certainly won't be spending in the middle of a recession. What will happen is that high-income earners will accumulate yet more wealth by buying more shares or paying off the mortgage on their investment property.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's also worth remembering that this is the third consecutive budget where this government has put forward some version of these tax cuts, going further and faster every time. The first two times around, it was the magical impending surplus—which didn't last long, mind you—that supposedly enabled the tax cuts. The third time around, there is not a surplus in sight and yet here are the tax cuts again. What this shows is that these tax cuts are ideological, pure and simple. Surplus or no surplus, pandemic or no pandemic, deficit or no deficit, debt or no debt, this government is always going to let the wealthy accumulate more wealth. And here's a newsflash for you: tax cuts are of absolutely no benefit if you don't have a job.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Instead of giving tax cuts to millionaires, we should be helping the millions of Australians who are unemployed and underemployed. JobSeeker must be permanently increased so people, all people, can lead a dignified life. Money given to people who need it not only is the right thing to do but will get spent in our economy. If this government cared about its people and cared about the state of the economy, this budget would make sure that those whom this government seems content to confine to joblessness have a chance to live with some dignity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But this government isn't content with just helping out the millionaires and the superrich. This budget also extends $99 billion a year in corporate welfare. It doesn't matter to the government that companies in Australia are already extracting record profits. It doesn't matter that the share market has already recovered most of its losses. It doesn't matter that one in three of the biggest corporations in this country pay absolutely zero tax. It doesn't matter, because apparently the big corporations need yet more corporate welfare and yet more help from the public purse—Liberal mates, Liberal donors.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What of the climate emergency? This government would rather the country burned than upset the most favoured of Liberal donors, the fossil fuel industry. The so-called gas-led recovery is nothing other than an abomination. It's been designed by hand-picked gas company executives who want to turn our country into a petro state. The International Energy Agency has spelt out that there is no room for any new carbon-emitting energy source if the Paris targets are to be met. But this government could not care less. Colleagues, we're not headed for a gas led recovery; we are just being gaslit. That's what's going on in this budget. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Budgets are about choices, and these choices that are made in budgets reflect a government's priorities. The Australian Greens reject this government's choices and its priorities. We reject neoliberalism in whatever form it comes. The Australian Greens want to build an economy that works for people, not the other way around. We want to build an economy that respects nature, that respects our ecosystems and that respects our climate and doesn't see our natural places merely as resources to be dug up and burned and profited from or as dumping grounds for toxic chemicals, carbon and pollutants. If we can remake our society to protect us from a virus, we can remake it to look after everyone, to look after climate and to look after nature. The Greens' plan responds to the magnitude of the challenges we face and the three intersecting crises: the pandemic, rising wealth inequality, and the climate and biodiversity emergency. This is a choice that our parliament can make.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our plan is built around a government backed jobs and income guarantee that would ensure that everyone has the income they need to live with dignity. It will also get us back to full employment as quickly as possible. No-one should get left behind, and the Greens' plan ensures that no-one will be. This is a choice that our parliament can make.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our plan is built around massive government investment in health, in education, in public and active transport and in the whole range of public services that people need and want, delivered at a high quality. It's built around massive investment in manufacturing and renewable energy—far beyond that which is included in the government's budget. These will be the building blocks of a fairer and cleaner economy. We can't afford not to do this. This is a choice that our parliament can make.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our plan is built around our Create Australia strategy—a jobs-rich plan for the creative industries in our country, underpinned by a commitment to get artists into our schools and libraries and a decent kickstart to get more Australian content onto our screens and live performances back to our stages. This is a choice that our parliament can make.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And for young people—who, as with all recessions, are copping the brunt of it—our plan is built around a next-gen guarantee: free education, a living income and a guaranteed decent job, if you want it. Our nation's future depends on trusting in and believing in the next generation. This is a choice that our parliament can make.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With the money that this budget commits to tax cuts we can have a green recovery that creates hundreds of thousands of good, decent and well-paid jobs, ensures everyone has an income they can live on and creates a clean, strong and stable economy. We can set everyone up to live a good and dignified life while we respect nature and our planet's climate. A plan to do this is not just possible; it's necessary. This is a choice that our parliament can make.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll sign off with a quote from Sir David Attenborough, made only hours ago: 'Nature will flourish when those that have a great deal perhaps have a little less.' Thanks, David. The Greens couldn't agree more.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="144292" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator PATRICK</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:47</span>):  I rise tonight to respond to the government's budget, handed down earlier this week. It's a post-COVID budget. It's a budget that takes us from a predicted $11 billion surplus for this year to $213.7 billion of deficit. Gross debt was expected to be 27 per cent of GDP in 2019-20. Gross debt is now expected to be 44 per cent of GDP at 30 June 2021 and to increase to 51.6 per cent of GDP at 30 June 2024. I am just describing the environment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has announced a wide range of revenue measures, reducing tax receipts whilst at the same time spending up big. Spending big might be appropriate as we recover from COVID—as long as money is spent effectively. Spending money is easy. Spending money wisely is a much harder thing to do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm not going to present an alternative plan. That's not the role of an Independent. My job is to give honest commentary as to what I've seen presented by the government. I've decided that I'm not going to talk about what's in the budget, however. I'll have plenty of opportunities to do that as implementing legislation comes before this chamber. Tomorrow, for example, I'll speak on tax related matters in the bill that is currently before the Senate and the subject of government business. Rather, I want to talk about what's missing in the budget. I want to talk about this because COVID brought us the opportunity to sit back and examine how things could be different on the other side of the curve. But that opportunity has been squandered by government—a government without vision or brave thought. They have just delivered same old, same old approaches: tax cuts, instant asset write-offs, tax concessions, spending on this and spending on that. Even having engaged the NCCC, a body of purported visionaries, we still don't have anything visionary that's come out of that particular forum—a forum that has cost the taxpayers a lot of money.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's go to revenue. Revenue will fall by $55 billion in this financial year and $283 billion over the four years to 2023. That's revenue based on a number of widely optimistic assumptions. The budget makes the assumption that there are not going to be any second or third COVID waves. Basically, it relies on a vaccination being fully in place by late 2021. We've heard the government talking about vaccinations, and their optimism—talking about dates and then having to slip them, and then slipping them again and then slipping them again. At the COVID committee I asked about the logistics of rolling out a vaccination across Australia—who would be first, who the priorities are and how the vaccination would be dispatched across Australia. The government certainly doesn't have that well planned at this point in time. The reality is that vaccinations take time. We can be very optimistic, and I have no problem with being optimistic, but I prefer the approach by the philosopher Seneca, who said, 'Hope for the best but plan for the worst.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the assumptions in the budget is interesting. In fact, I went back to 2019-20 and saw that the Treasury's estimates for the price of iron ore were $55 per tonne, FOB. I then looked at what this budget said and, amazingly, it said that they predicted the iron ore price would be $55 per tonne, FOB, by the end of the June quarter in 2022. I don't know if this is a cut-and-paste error. I acknowledge that $55 a tonne is in fact a conservative number, but it leaves me questioning the modelling assumptions in relation to the economic outlook—modelling assumptions that simply are not spelt out in detail in the budget. Again based on assumption is the number of jobs—there is no detail as to how the government came to the figures that are being used in the budget. We have to accept those on blind faith.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Still talking about revenue: I would have thought that this crisis would have been the opportunity to engage in significant revenue reform, but it's completely absent. Simplifying the tax system with a few broad-ranging taxes would have been good—personal income tax, corporate tax, private consumption or GST and economic rents from natural resources and land. It's the Ken Henry model. That's the sort of thing we could have been doing to simplify things. Of course, we would still retain taxes for special purposes—things like tobacco taxes to encourage people not to smoke and also perhaps taxes around traffic congestion. Instead, we will retain a complex tax system with other state taxes, job-killing taxes such as payroll tax, not being addressed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of tax cuts, that is in the budget, but what is missing is any analysis as to whether or not they're affordable. I say that having been through a comprehensive process the last time we looked at it and as a crossbencher having the special privileges of access to Treasury and having examined exactly what was going on inside Budget Paper No. 1. The argument at that time presented to me was: 'We are on the verge of a surplus. Now is the right time for tax cuts.' It turns out now we're at a $213 deficit, and it's the right time for tax cuts! So I'll just put on the record that I have reservations about these tax cuts. This entire chamber will vote tomorrow on tax cuts, blind as to any analysis of whether or not they're affordable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator McKim talked about tax minimisation. Has that been addressed? There's nothing to address the 220 companies that had revenues of $850 billion over five tax transparency years and paid no tax—$850 billion of revenue and they paid no tax. Companies like ExxonMobil last paid corporate tax in 2013. Over the five years 2013-14 to 2017-18, they had $42 billion in revenue, with no corporate tax paid. They told the Senate economics committee in 2018 that the company wouldn't pay corporate tax until 2021. They spent $10 million fighting the tax office in relation to tax. The interesting thing is: on the verge of them suggesting they will pay tax, what are they doing? They're leaving the country. They're selling out of the Bass Strait and leaving the country. They've come in here, they've taken all of our oil and gas, they've paid very little in PRRT and they're leaving the country. What mugs we are! I'll contrast that with what Equinor does in Norway. In 2018-19 they paid taxes of $22 billion. They also paid a revenue to the state, because it's state owned, of about $3 billion. These are huge amounts of money, and that's just one example of how to do it right. We do not do it right here in Australia when it comes to rent resources tax.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Lendlease: five years of tax transparency data show that they've had $43 billion in revenue and have paid not a brass razoo in tax. And we're rewarding them. This year we've given them over a billion dollars of defence contracts to build facilities at Osborne, HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Watson</span> and HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Stirling</span>. They're not alone. Origin Energy: $59 billion and only $108 million tax paid. Ford: $14 billion and no tax paid. Virgin: $23 billion and no tax paid—but they certainly asked for a handout during the COVID crisis! How do you think most Australians feel when they're listening to the budget? Sure, they're going to get a tax cut, but mums and dads, nurses, tradies, bus drivers and all of those sorts of people are paying their fair share of tax, and you've got companies earning tens of billions of dollars paying no tax at all. It's not right, and you're not doing anything about it. There's nothing in the budget that seeks to address that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's no digital tax, so we've got Facebook and Google—one might argue essential utilities—creaming money out of this country, taking it, offshoring the money and paying very little tax. And what's the government doing about it? Nothing. There's nothing in this budget.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll turn to grandfathered large proprietary companies—that old chestnut. I know you don't like me talking about it. There are 1,119 companies—privileged companies—that don't have to lodge financial reports with ASIC. ASIC has testified to the Senate that that encourages aggressive tax minimisation. When we ask the coalition why it hasn't dealt with this, there's no policy reason as to why this loophole through which these companies don't have to file their financial returns to ASIC is acceptable or useful. Nothing is being done about that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Going back to the PRRT, it's just not working. We are giving away our finite resources, and there is no fix in the budget for that. And even when those companies do pay tax and they do pay PRRT they can get it back when they shut down their assets here in Australia. They can draw back off the PRRT they've paid to help them shut down their facilities. They come here, they set up, they write off all of their capital investment, they don't pay a brass razoo for the resources and then they charge us on the way out. Seriously? That's Liberal economic management? There is nothing in the budget to fix it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">How do I know about that little PRRT arrangement when companies leave the country? It's because we've got an example of it playing out right now in the Timor Sea. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Northern Endeavour</span>, an FPSO, a floating production, storage and offtake vessel, was sold by Woodside to a company called NOGA. The Commonwealth basically drove that company into liquidation. I say that because it's on the record. Before NOGA went into liquidation I warned NOPSEMA and I warned the minister that this was going to happen. They were driven into liquidation. That means there's an asset out there, <span style="font-style:italic;">Northern Endeavour</span>, that is the responsibility of the taxpayer. We paid $28 million in 2019-20 to operate this vessel in lighthouse mode. The budget tells us there will be another $47 million for this financial year. We have this uncontrolled cost and no explanation as to how we're going to deal with this vessel that was owned by Woodside. The bizarre thing is that we're now actually paying consulting fees to Woodside to try and sort the mess out. At the same time, we've got Exxon departing Australia. They've got JP Morgan trying to sell their ageing assets in Bass Strait. They'll sell them, and we'll end up in the same situation where the taxpayer ends up operating those stranded assets in lighthouse mode.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll turn now to spending—education and training. I do welcome the VET spending and the apprenticeships, but we all know about the higher education funding and how damaging that is going to be for Australia, for our students and for our future. And there is no money for TAFE.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then I look at our procurement policies. What we should be doing post COVID is directing government agencies to clause 4.7 of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Commonwealth Procurement Rules</span>. I know that particular clause because I helped negotiate it into the <span style="font-style:italic;">Commonwealth Procurement Rules</span> back when the ABCC negotiations were going on. That clause requires officials to look at the economic benefit that flows from a contract: How many jobs does it create? How much capital investment is there in Australia? What's the supply chain effect here in Australia? The clause is in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Procurement Rules</span>. It hasn't been used. One of the first contracts we saw going out in the COVID crisis, when we suddenly hit the realisation that we don't have much resilience, went to Amazon—AWS—instead of Australian companies. I don't know if you know how angry that makes Australian taxpayers. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We should be learning post-COVID about reliance. What we've seen is supply chain shortages as a result of COVID. The interesting thing is that it's passive disruption to our supply chains. It's not like people are trying to stop goods getting to Australia; they're just not getting here. Imagine if we were in a conflict situation—and there is a possibility that might occur—where there was active disruption. Do we see that being addressed? Not through this budget. We're exposing ourselves. We haven't learned. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we look at things like defence spending. I know better than most people in this place that we need a strong Defence Force. I understand how it works. I understand its role and its deterrence role. I understand—as much as we would never like to see them used—the importance of having well-trained, well-equipped forces. But I look at some of the projects that have been commissioned by this government. Take the submarines. I'm a former submariner; I like submarines and I think they offer extremely useful military capabilities. But we've got a submarine project that has gone from $50 billion in 2015 to $89 billion. Our Hunter class frigates have gone from $30 billion to $45 billion. So, whilst we're dealing with a huge deficit and a crisis that we're trying to manage, we've got basically no-one doing anything about a $54 billion blowout. Most people don't understand what $54 billion is. To make it clearer, that is 54,000 million dollars. That's the blowout. Has the government looked to address that? No. They say, 'That's okay; we'll just get a billion dollars off our universities and our students.' They've got no idea on how to fix that problem. They remain silent. It's incompetence. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And of course we've got a total lack of AIC commitment—commitment to use Australian industry in those programs. We've seen the percentages for the future submarine. They are shocking percentages, well below 50 per cent despite the 90 per cent promise by the Liberal government. We chose a submarine designer and we restricted ourselves to one supplier, and that supplier is now exercising its commercial advantage, charging us as much as it likes along the way. These are not my words; this is the Auditor-General criticising that particular decision, that there is no competition there. The French are going to European companies that they're used to working with and they're purchasing through their normal supply chains. What a bizarre situation. We have a battery company in South Australia that's been working on Collins batteries for as long as they've been in service—since the mid-nineties—and what are we doing? We're making them compete against a Greek company for the batteries for the future submarine. Really? I can't believe it. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the budget, we have $1.5 billion allocated to manufacturing. That is totally inadequate. We know that manufacturing creates jobs, we know that manufacturing generates IP, we know that it builds resilience into our supply chains, we know that it helps with export and we know that it helps with our balance of payments, yet we give the manufacturing sector $1.5 billion; that's it. At least we've seen a reversal of the terrible, terrible concept associated with the R&amp;D tax bill that the government was going to pursue. Let me give you a tip: after COVID, we need R&amp;D. But we also needed it before that. I welcome the change but it shows ineptitude.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am pleased the government have allocated $15 million to build transmission towers in Whyalla for our interconnector—first the South Australia-New South Wales interconnector and then moving on to other transmission towers. That is a good thing. That $15 million will create 180 jobs and will repatriate work back to Australia, using Australian steel. It is a fantastic program that costs $15 million. I wonder whether we test some of the other measures against that sort of result. I do thank the government for that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But there is nothing in the budget dealing with value-add. In this country we have to stop just exporting rocks, stop taking our iron ore and sending it overseas and stop taking our lithium and sending it overseas. We don't consider the value in conducting these sorts of activities here in Australia. In 2025 we're expecting the lithium export market around the world to be somewhere around the $25 billion mark. Batteries will be in the trillions of dollars. We should be investing in that sort of capability and that sort of value-add here. This is not a criticism, but the problem is that the Liberal Party looks at things and says to Australian companies, 'We need to have minimum wages, we need to have occupational health and safety, we need to have environmental standards and we need to have Australian standards in our products'. They are good things; I don't suggest that we shouldn't do that. But having imposed all these costs on Australian business, we then look overseas and the products are cheaper for some reason. So we buy the cheaper product from the countries that don't have minimum wages and from the countries that don't have environmental standards and have substandard products.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have to start changing the way we think. Electric vehicles—I'm glad to see there are some charging stations, but we're not doing enough in that space. I congratulate the government for $5 million allocated to a company that will build electric vehicles out of South Australia; that is a great thing. Again, with $5 million seed funding, we will get an industry that will grow from that with up to 2,400 indirect jobs.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have an extra $10 billion for infrastructure in the budget. Most people would think that is a good thing; however, what people need to understand is these contracts will go to tier 1 construction companies and, in Australia, there are no longer Australian owned tier 1 companies; they are all foreign owned. What's going to happen is the government will award contracts to the tier 1s, not the tier 2s, and those companies will squeeze the Australian supply chain. Most of those companies come from Spain. They will go back to Spain, and they will take products from Spain, because they know those products, and include them in the infrastructure. They will squeeze so much from the Australian companies to make a profit and then they will send that profit offshore. We need to rethink this. We need to make sure that tier 2 companies, the Australian companies, are priming these infrastructure projects. Things must change in that space.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Space Agency—failure to launch. There is some additional funding in the budget for the Space Agency. We have a space industry that is charging ahead. I was up in Ceduna watching the launch. Unfortunately, it couldn't go to 100 kilometres because the Space Agency is unable to issue launch permits. It can't keep up with industry. The space industry is bringing the work to Australia, and these international companies are leaving because we can't get a launch permit—unbelievable!</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to think about a national endeavour, perhaps a constellation of satellites that could monitor bushfires. We need to think about national endeavours. That's what we want to have in the budget.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Social housing is missing from the budget. The government likes to talk about affordable housing through a private investor model, but that hasn't worked. We need to think about social housing to tackle homelessness and to revitalise the construction industry.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On energy, let's start looking at things in an engineering light. We set the goals—clean, reliable and affordable—and let the market do its work. Everyone's talking about trying to bring gas prices down. Well, here's a hint: get the gas from the inexpensive sources. We have so much gas here in Australia; there is not a shortage. But what's happening is that companies are sending it overseas. All the inexpensive gas from the Cooper Basin is being exported and we're being left to pay the high wellhead prices. This is a policy failure not addressed in the budget.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And then we come to women. They are massively overrepresented in COVID job loss figures, but this has not been addressed. There's no long-term reform to child care. Where's the funding for domestic violence and legal services? Minister Ruston's response in relation to this is, 'Women can take advantage of driving on new infrastructure and roads, so to suggest the budget doesn't focus on women is wrong.' Seriously? That's the policy—as a woman, you get to drive a car? The next idea coming from the Prime Minister will be to reinstate the old rule where a man with a flag has to walk in front of a woman when she is driving! That's going to create jobs! That's the next idea—I can just see it! Aged care is missing as well. The 23,000 new home-care packages fall woefully short of the 100,000 that are needed.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I wrap up, my favourite topic, which is dear to my heart, is oversight and accountability—cutting the Auditor-General's budget as retribution for the good work that they've done in disclosing maladministration. There is a shrinking budget for the ABC. They can't recognise the fire coverage they had. They don't recognise the value of their journalism. ICAC is missing. There is no vision in this budget. It's a bit like the Governor-General's speech—which was not the Governor-General's speech, it was the Prime Minister's speech. There is no vision in it. There is no growing the pie. There is no making the pie tastier. We have lost huge opportunities in this budget.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:18</span>):  The value of independence in the parliament isn't to play dress-ups. We don't get elected to be you guys; we get elected to be everything but. No matter how hard you try to keep this place to yourselves, we're here. And we're here with a mission. We get a seat at the table to talk about things you wouldn't otherwise talk about. We can force issues into debate. If we're going to do that, I reckon we should deal with the issues that aren't getting discussed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is plenty in the budget that I have no issue with at all. I just want to take a couple of minutes to say a few things about what I'd like to see more of. These times of crisis are a chance to reset. We have an opportunity here to use the emergency response to get the country on a path that is better than the one it was on before. We don't just want to go back to where we were; we want to aim higher. We should be sorting out the problems that we've been letting drift for way too long and thinking about how we want things to work when we get back to normal. We should be looking for ideas for the country that we never could have considered possible before, and deciding to do things that we've been putting off for too long.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The enormous spending measures in this budget are a chance to use the huge amounts of money that we are borrowing on behalf of the country to build a future that looks very different from our past. It is a chance to take a step back and look at what's been working for the country and what's not been going so well—and there is plenty of that. It's time to wipe the slate clean and say, 'Let's build something new that will last beyond this crisis.' You don't get a free pass to spend $100 billion very often. You don't get a get-out-of-jail-free card on $1 trillion of debt very often. It takes a global pandemic for people to go, 'Yes, that sounds fair enough.' It takes a national shutdown for the rest of us in this place to see the government going for that and let it slide. That kind of money is enough to completely reshape our country and the way our economy works. When you've got that sort of opportunity ahead of you, there is a lot you can do with it. The choices you make reflect what your true priorities are. They show who you put first and who you will put last. They show what you think Australia should look like 10 years from now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd have made different choices about how to spend that money. First of all, I wonder whether the government are actually putting enough into the economy to get us out of this mess in the first place. There are going to be more people out of work because of this crisis for years, and the people who are lucky enough to have a job won't see their wages go up for a very long time. The assumptions that underpin the Treasurer's pictures of where we are going to be in a year from now seem pretty rosy to me. For one thing, he's assumed that we will have a population-wide vaccine by the end of the year. Dear oh dear! I don't know what vaccine he's been taking, but I can tell you now that vaccines take decades to be developed, tested and manufactured. Then they have to be distributed so everyone is covered. Honestly, if the Treasurer thinks he is safe banking on all that happening in 12 months, he is living in la la land. He seriously is. He reckons that once we get a vaccine people will go back to spending money, building houses and coming to Australia like normal. It's a pretty big gamble to take. If it turns out he's wrong, he might wish we'd put in some more economic support to stand us in better stead through the next year at the very least. So while I understand that Australians out there are worried about the debt, I think there's more the Treasurer should have put into this budget to keep the economy rolling.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The first thing I would have put in is more for social housing. The only party that has not agreed with that is the government. It's absolutely bizarre that the rest of us can see it. The government has been looking the other way from people who don't have a safe place to sleep for far too long. With the Treasurer going on a $74 billion spending spree, I would have thought he could find some coins down the back of the couch to do something about that. Building a few thousand new homes would take a dent out of the huge waiting list for people to get into affordable housing, which has been growing across the states and territories for more than a decade. The government wouldn't just be helping people to get a roof over their heads; it would help people get back into work and give them stability. Ask just about any economist in the country about what the Treasurer should spend money on to get the economy moving, and they will tell you that social housing is a sure bet. It's a sure bet. When the government goes in and directly builds houses, they are employing tradies, keeping the construction industry going and getting that money straight into local businesses. It's much better than building a new road or train line, because you can roll it out really fast and you know the finished product will be put to good use.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know the Treasurer would say that social housing is a problem for the states, not his party, but honestly, that's a real cop out. It is the coalition's favourite thing to say when they are faced with a problem that they can't be bothered to fix but which makes sense to fix. It absolutely makes sense to fix this. I would say to them it's about time they showed some leadership and got this done. They are perfectly capable of it. The federal government has run this show before, and we all know they can do it again. All it takes is the will and the courage to make it happen.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The same goes for our TAFEs and our manufacturing sector. I'm glad that the Prime Minister has finally woken up to the fact that we need to start making things in Australia again. That's a start. But don't talk the talk on this one with me, Prime Minister; I want to see you walk the walk. I can tell you: if ripping off our students is any guide for the future then I don't hold out much hope for our TAFEs. So my question is: where's the commitment? Where's the follow-through? You talk big on supporting trades, but there's nothing in this budget to fix up our crumbling TAFEs. We've got kids trying to get their cert IIIs in rooms with broken windows and no heating. They're working on machines from the Cold War that are older than we are in here. At my local TAFE, toxic paint fumes rise up through the holes in the floorboards where kids are doing nursing courses. Kids all around Tassie are being trained in rooms full of asbestos, because we can't afford to fix them up. Where's your commitment, Prime Minister? You can't manufacture without skills. You need to get those skills from TAFE.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I wanted this manufacturing plan from the PM to lay out how we're going to fix this stuff. I'd hoped it meant we'd get some real reform for vocational education in this country. Surely it's obvious that we aren't going to kickstart our manufacturing industry if the people who want to do a trade can't get the training they need to get onto a work site in the first place. Instead, we got $7 million a year for the organisation that pays Scott Cam a six-figure salary to put up a few flashy videos about trades on social media. Honestly! Our TAFEs are allowed to apply for 'some' funding to offer free short courses for school leavers and jobseekers. That's it? That's as good as it gets?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our TAFEs need more leadership and they need a hell of a lot more than what you are offering, which is nothing. We're going nowhere. They need the Prime Minister to stand up and figure out how to get our vocational education sector back up to the job of training our kids for the jobs that we will need to rebuild our economy. That's what I'd spend some money on. That's where my priorities would be. I figure you're not doing that, because you actually don't have a plan for the future. If you can't start at the basics and tell our kids who want trades what trades are going to be available, then I tell you what: you have no bloody idea. I don't actually believe you have an idea or a plan for manufacturing or building in this country. I don't think you are actually capable of it, and I'll call you out for it now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Do something about JobSeeker. We're in October. The extra money for people on JobSeeker ends in December, 2½ months from now. People on the dole are looking at going back to eating noodles, missing bills and not being able to turn on the air con through the middle of summer. We haven't even got to the May budget yet, when they're going to need their heating. I imagine that by then they'll be living with blankets from Vinnies. Instead of giving people on JobSeeker any idea about how much money they'll have to live on next year, we're pouring cash into the pockets of people who have managed to keep their jobs and do quite well through the crisis. That's the answer to it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm not saying those tax cuts won't help; maybe they will. I see the value in letting people keep more of the money that they earn, and I guess some of it will get spent to help the local economy move again. But the people who get the most benefit are the people who are lucky enough to still have a job. They've made it through the previous six months with their careers intact and their pay cheques full. They don't need it as much as the childcare workers and the home carers who got the boot from their jobs when the community went into lockdown back in March. Anyone can see that it would have made a lot more sense to spread that money out the other way. We all know that people on the lower end would spend it more. The money would be going straight into their local communities and their local economies, not their bank accounts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would have put more into veteran hubs for our ex-service men and women who need a place to go when times are getting tough. There are already centres in Townsville and Brisbane. The people who rely on them say they're magic. They work by bringing together veteran service organisations and advocates under one roof. They are a one-stop-shop; they save lives. That's what they do. Once again, here's the veterans minister: 'Yes, we want hubs; we're promising, promising.' It's like a horse race, isn't it? It just comes to a halt. It's all over red rover and we never get to the finish line, do we, Minister Chester? Shocker! These hubs are not hard, and there is no excuse for not having every single one of them in a state by now. You've had more than enough time. There are no more excuses, apart from the fact you're incapable of getting the job done. Maybe it is time you went elsewhere. Go to another department; bring someone else in who can actually get the job done, because you are certainly not getting the job done for veterans.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These hubs create a community space for at-risk veterans to put their hands up and ask for help. If you think spending $26 million a year for the next four years—it's certainly not going to be enough for our veterans to get the help that they need, and $64 million won't touch the sides in the Department of Veterans' Affairs. The problems there are so big. It's not money that we need, mate, it's management. It's structural reform that we need. If you can't see that, Minister Chester, then, once again, you're in the wrong department, mate—get out! Throwing money at the problem, like we do every year, isn't going to be enough to stop veterans from being let down by a department that fundamentally does not put their interests first. The department is more interested in covering its arse, and that's exactly what it does. It's an institution that has lost its way, but it's not there for veterans.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, the ALP might have a crack at the government for debt and deficit. They've got to attack someone for something, so that's fair enough, but if it takes $1 trillion to save 25 million people from losing their jobs, homes, savings and safety nets then spend it. If it costs more, spend more. Spend more! It'll save us in the long run. You can't give me any moral justification for refusing to spend taxpayers money to protect taxpayers from losing all their money. Don't get me wrong, you can spend in good ways and you can spend in bad ways. I'm not saying spend for the sake of it, I'm just saying that it's pretty cynical to attack the government over debt and deficit to try and undermine their reputation for economic responsibility, particularly if sometimes economic responsibility means spending huge amounts of money to keep the economy from falling off the cliff. It's irresponsible to let the economy collapse just so that you can run a surplus. Nobody's receiving a letter of termination from their boss and thinking to themselves, 'At least the government's in surplus.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If we're going to spend huge amounts of money, if that's what it takes to keep us afloat, we've got to match unprecedented spending with unprecedented transparency. Just like pollen brings bees, cash brings lobbyists. If money is being spent, you can bet anything that there will be donors, mates and lobbyists stepping over each other to get a slice of the pie. The more money we're spending, the more we need to give people confidence that we're spending it right. The good news is that's easily sorted. Don't cut money from the ANAO. The Australian National Audit Office need that money. As a matter of fact, you should be putting more staff in there, you should be smashing them in there so that there's some sort of oversight in this parliament! They're the guys who are out there every week, slapping government ministers across the chops for misusing taxpayers money. They spotted the sports rorts, so this is their punishment. You take cash off them and say: 'Hey! We're going to get less of you guys.' They called out the government for spending $30 million on a plot of land worth 10 times less than that. Who does that? Goodness me! You call yourselves great economists over there. Who got ripped off? No, not you people but the taxpayer. The ANAO are pretty much the only independent check that we have on the way the government spend money and run projects. They asked the government for an extra $6 million this year so that they could keep their heads above water. Instead, guess what the government did? They cut 14 million bucks! Oversight up here is gone. It's finished! It's over. It's very scary, but that's the truth of the matter.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Don't end it there though. Fixed donation laws and real-time disclosures: if you've got nothing to hide then let's do it. But, oh no, don't mention that to the coalition. Jesus Christ, they'd go white and nearly faint! No, nothing about donation laws here. There's nothing to see. Count up how much people donate over a fixed period and make them disclose their donations if they go over a low threshold. It's not that hard. Change the lobbying rules so that everyone who comes into this building looking for something has to play by the same set of rules. Punish them if they break those rules. You need punishment; if you don't punish people the problems will continue. If you don't set an example when people play up and you don't discipline them then the problems will become worse. This one might be a little niche, but if the non-government senators in this place want to inquire into something the government is doing then the government shouldn't get to vote against it. They should go through without debate. It wouldn't cost them anything and it's simple to do. What's wrong with them?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know we've been talking big numbers since the virus first hit us in March, and the amount of money that we're shovelling out the door in this budget is hard to comprehend. To put it in perspective, last year the government told us that they couldn't afford to pay $5 billion to raise Newstart by 100 bucks a week. They told us that it would be irresponsible for them to start paying people enough to live on because it would risk their 'back in the black' surplus. Well, how is that going now? The stimulus measures in this budget are worth 20 times that. It's enough money to completely change the way this country works, and since we'll be paying it back for decades it's a shame we aren't spending it, once again, on the right things and, once again, on those who are less fortunate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think that between now and the May budget we're going to see exactly what the coalition is made of. I'll be honest: I actually don't hold out much hope, because what I've seen since I've been here is a lot of rhetoric and a lot of talking the talk and very little walking the walk. The government cannot continue to spend money—they cannot just throw money out there—and then turn around. When you do something you have to follow it through. They have to make sure that money is actually doing its job. That's what they have to do—that's what good managers do. That's how it works; that's leadership. If we don't see that in this country then all that money they're throwing out there is going to be wasted, and it's the taxpayers' money—it belongs to them. The government has to start following through for the sake of this country. Every dollar counts! Every dollar! I don't want to see my grandchildren having to pay for this, but I can guarantee they will. And their kids are probably going to be paying for it too. It shouldn't be that way.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="e5x" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator POLLEY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:01</span>):  I rise to speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (A Tax Plan for the COVID-19 Economic Recovery) Bill 2020. The announcements in this bill do six things. They bring forward the stage 2 tax cuts to 2020-21. They bring forward the removal of the low- and middle-income tax offset to the end of the 2020-21 financial year to provide a temporary additional tax cut for those on incomes up to $126,000. They increase the small business turnover threshold for certain concessions to $50 million. They make amendments to the research and development tax incentive cuts. They implement the temporary loss carry-back against previous profits. Lastly, they introduce temporary full expensing of depreciating assets' instant asset write-off.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has introduced this omnibus tax bill for many of the major measures announced in the 2020-21 budget. Some of these measures have been known for some time while others have only just been announced and rushed through. The Morrison government are throwing around money like confetti and hoping that it will stick. Labor will support the income tax cuts for low- and middle-income earners and has argued since last year that they should be brought forward to support Australians desperately in need of more relief. These tax cuts are not the only answer to our economic recovery—there will need to be a lot more boosting of spending power and consumption—but they are a start.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These tax cuts will not be enough for older workers, who have been completely forgotten about. There was nothing in this budget for older workers, even though they make up the bulk of JobKeeper and JobSeeker recipients. When they attempt to gain employment how will they compete with young Australians, who will receive a concession of up to $200 a week? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We don't want to hold up these measures and their capacity to do good in the economy, but we are concerned about the collection of other measures proposed in this legislation. We had notice of these only on Tuesday night. The government need to be aware that, if any issues arise due to a lack of inquiry or scrutiny, the buck stops squarely with them. We could have separated these measures so that we could analyse them in a more timely manner and had more than three days to investigate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill makes amendments to enable eligible entities with an aggregated turnover of $10 million or more and less than $50 million to access certain small business entity tax concessions. We support the increase in these thresholds; however, there has been no additional support for small businesses. Small businesses are the backbone of our economy. They employ local people and support our local communities. They couldn't be any more important in my home state of Tasmania. They have also been hit hardest by the Morrison recession. Those businesses with annual turnover of less than $10 million make up 98 per cent of all businesses in Australia—that's 98 per cent of Australian small businesses that have been left out. This means the bulk of businesses will be missing out on any form of relief from this recession. The Morrison government has forgotten about these businesses that employ millions of people, and this is an example of its inability to use targeted reforms.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There was a collapse in business investment before this crisis began. This may be a result of having 22 different energy policies in the last seven years and no clear leadership. Again, none of these measures introduced in this bill present permanent changes in a way that the government will incentivise business in this country. I hope that the $27 billion that will be spent on the instant asset write-off stimulates private sector investment, but, when this support is withdrawn in the next 18 months or so and the incentives drop away, we may be left with a big hole in the budget with nothing—I repeat, nothing—to show for it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are in the deepest, most damaging recession in almost 100 years. There is a job crisis, with almost a million Australians unemployed, and the government has acknowledged that another 160,000 Australians are expected to join unemployment queues by the end of this year. We need to do what we can to fix this with a jobs plan. We have a jobs crisis, and this government and its recession is only making matters worse. Incentivising the private sector is an important part of that. Private investment needs to be stimulated to grow again. Those companies will start hiring and accelerating our recovery. We've been saying for some time we need some clarity and leadership from the government so that business can respond appropriately. Using the tax system is an important way to go about that, but it will not be our only saviour.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need meaningful long-term reform to encourage business investment in this country. A great way to do this would be by investing in tourism and renewable energy, especially in Tasmania, but, unfortunately, Tasmania has been completely left out of this budget. In fact, they've been left off the map. It's not the first time, but, after seven years, Tasmanians are fed up. They're sick and tired of it. There is nothing in this budget at all to build confidence in the Tasmanian community. There are no plans for jobs, there are no plans for our health, there are no plans for our hospitals. The budget is merely the rehashing of previous announcements made by this government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There was a mere $13.5 million allocated to Tasmania for tourism. This industry delivers $4.5 billion a year to my home state and directly and indirectly employs 40,000 Tasmanians, but, because of the border restrictions, it has been completely obliterated. We need more than the $360 million upgrades to our roads and infrastructure. We need a jobs plan. We need leadership. We need a vision. This has been such a missed opportunity by this government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This Liberal government's budget has racked up $1 trillion in debt—$1 trillion! It is remarkable that the government have found room to do some of these things, but found no room for helping out and supporting the childcare sector. They've done nothing at all for older workers, nothing for social housing and, as I said, nothing for Tasmania. The government are good at making announcements and saying big numbers, but there is no guarantee that they will follow through and actually deliver for the people. We know Prime Minister Morrison is there for the photo-op, but is never there for the follow-up.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Deep concern exists that the $4 billion wage subsidy will be rorted, and I might say with very good reason. It will no doubt be used to replace older workers in favour of younger ones. JobMaker must be secure so employers will not simply employ two young casual workers and replace full-time employees. There must be security for these workers by ensuring that existing employees will not be replaced by subsidised workers. JobMaker does have the capacity to fuel insecure and low-paid work. I just hope that this government has thought this through, because it doesn't appear, with a very quick oversight of this bill, that there are adequate safeguards.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Last night, in complete contrast to this budget, Labor, through Anthony Albanese, the Labor leader, announced our plan for the future. It is a once-in-a-generation chance to reset our economy and rebuild our country for the better. Labor have proposed long-term reform, which includes a plan to revitalise manufacturing, a plan to rewrite our energy grid, a commitment to net zero emissions by 2050 and investment in social housing and in child care. Mr Albanese also spoke about aged care.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This budget, quite clearly, has left out so many different sectors of our community, and, most importantly from my perspective, with the crisis that we've been facing through this pandemic and now the recession and the aged-care crisis in this country, this government has left the country wanting yet again. We, in this country, have experienced 30,000 older Australians dying over the last three years while they've been waiting for their home-care packages that they were assessed to be in need of. That is a national disgrace. The minister for aged care has been asleep at the wheel. The Prime Minister has broken his election promise from last year when he said he was going to make aged care a priority. Quite frankly, in the last two budgets, aged care certainly has not been a major priority for this government. Older Australians who are assessed as needing level 3 and level 4 home-care packages are still waiting up to 18 months and beyond. That's a national disgrace.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is quite obvious that this is the interim budget before the election budget in May next year. The downside of that budget for next year is that it will not have the influence of Senator Cormann, the finance minister, who will be leaving the Senate. I'd like to, in my speech, pay credit to Senator Cormann for his role as a senator who comes in this place and is highly respected but also respects everyone's contribution around this chamber. I take the opportunity to wish him and his family all the very best.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But I'll get back to the important issue of the day, and that is exposing this government's failings on the budget and to contrast that to the Labor leader Anthony Albanese's budget-in-reply last night when he said—because it is Labor's view through and through—'We will not leave anyone behind.' That's Labor. That's the light on the hill. That's what runs through our veins as Labor members, party members, senators and members. We will not leave anyone behind. We can be a country that makes things and a country that is proud to put an Australian workforce first above all else, and we will always do that. We will put Australians first. We need to start manufacturing in this country again. We need to ensure Australians have the opportunity to go to university, no matter where they live, whether they're in regional Australia or in our fantastic cities. But this government has attacked the universities yet again, and for those who are aspiring—whether they're young, middle-aged or old—to go to university, this government have made it tougher and tougher for them to do it. We need to be prepared for a new era in this country: the opportunity to reset our economy, to reset the opportunities at universities, to reset the aged-care sector and to reset the job opportunities for all Australians. With this budget, this government has clearly failed in its job.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Leader of the Australian Greens in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:14</span>):  The Treasury Laws Amendment (A Tax Plan for the COVID-19 Economic Recovery) Bill 2020, much like the budget that was handed down this week, contains an awful lot of brown and a fair bit of trickle down. The bill and the budget are the latest incarnation of a flawed neoliberal ideology that has dominated major party Australian politics for the last 40-odd years. This is an ideology that's seen workers getting less and less, shareholders and executives getting more and more, structural unemployment and underemployment, housing costs going through the roof, public services being privatised and pillaged, wealth concentrating in the hands of the already very wealthy and of course the cooking of our planet, where climate polluters reap megaprofits, putting in danger the very ecosystem on which all life depends, just because that is what the market wanted.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So while this budget does away with an obsession with surplus, the Australian Greens are not for a moment fooled that this government has changed its stripes. The budget spends big but it spends badly. And the centrepiece of this budget and of this bill are the tax cuts that will see millionaires get 2½ thousand extra bucks a year, the working poor get a measly $250 extra in a year and the unemployed line up for their regular kick in the teeth. Don't be fooled by the spin. The additional offset for low- and middle-income earners is a one-off. It'll be gone in a year's time and people will be back to where they were before this budget and before this bill. There's a temporary boost for the millions but a permanent boost for the millionaires.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But, not content with selling out millions of Australians—giving them a day's bread while the millionaires take home the entire bakery—the government is being deceptive about how better off people will be in the end. They're making the benefit for low- and middle-income earners look twice as big as it really is by obscuring the fact that the offset turns into a tax cut next year. They're double-counting a temporary tax cut. That's where we've got to in terms of honesty in politics in this country. This is a government for whom being deceptive should be considered the starting point, and that's obvious to many Australians who are watching them closely. But it's a point that seems too difficult for the Australian Labor Party to get its collective head around. Here they are, coming in this morning, cheering on the government every step of the way.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Greens oppose the bringing forward of these tax cuts. In fact, we oppose stage 2 and stage 3 of the tax cuts in any form and at any time, because these tax cuts are top-end tax cuts. This is, of course, exactly what you'd expect from the Liberal Party, but I'm sure there are some Australians who still hold out hope that the Labor Party might actually go in to bat for people doing it tough. To give the Australian Labor Party the opportunity to express their desire for tax cuts targeted to those who are doing it tough, the Greens have an amendment that would prevent millionaires from getting a tax cut. We're in the middle of the worst recession in a century. Now is not the time to be giving millionaires a tax cut. Instead we should be using this money to keep JobSeeker and JobKeeper in full, to fund universal services like child care and our universities and to undertake a massive program of government investment into clean energy, public housing, essential public services, reforesting, rewilding and public infrastructure—for example, a light rail down the east coast of Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This budget also contains a massive $99 billion a year worth of welfare for the big corporations. There's $43 billion a year in contracts for weapons companies, $7 billion a year in public subsidies for private health insurers, $8 billion a year for climate polluters in the form of fuel tax credits—and that's before you even get to the ridiculously low rate of tax paid by them, because the petroleum resource rent tax is nothing other than a rort. There is $13 billion in contracts to outsource the work that should be being done by the Public Service, particularly to the big four accounting firms, who get paid twice as much just to tell the government what it wants to hear. And there is at least $3.5 billion each and every year to the major banks because, of course, the government regards them as too big to fail and the market knows that the government will bail them out, no matter what their misdeeds—and, boy, is the list of their misdeeds long. It's far too long for me to go into today, but I do refer people to the findings of the banking royal commission.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Add these welfare measures for big corporations to those contained in this bill, namely, the temporary full expensing of capital expenditure and the temporary ability to carry back losses for businesses with a turnover of up to $5 billion. The Greens don't oppose outright the instant asset write-off facilities or the introduction of loss carry-back measures. In fact we've taken policies to successive elections calling for these measures for small business, including reinstating that which the Abbott government repealed as part of the repeal of the mining tax. But the government's policy and, indeed, this bill are completely unstrategic. They fail to put these measures together with a more comprehensive suite of reforms that deal with the structural problems for businesses in Australia. Those are issues such as increasingly concentrated markets in which monopolies engage in price gouging of consumers in order to extract superprofits for shareholders and issues such as the declining share of income going to workers. That's not because workers aren't putting in the effort or the hours but because our industrial system has been deregulated over the last 40-odd years and also because the workforce has been atomised and individualised to the point that 40 per cent of workers in this country are now in some form of insecure work. There are also issues such as the impact of globalisation, both on our domestic industrial capacity and on our tax base. We should be questioning just how good trade deals have been for Australian businesses and we should be doing far more to stop multinationals from shifting profits offshore through a complicated web of tax avoidance arrangements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So as to make these big-business-cut concessions more about restructuring the economy to work for people and for our planet, the Greens will move amendments to prohibit the full expensing of depreciable assets that are used for coal, gas, weapons manufacturing or tobacco and to restrict access to the full expensing of depreciable assets to those that have been produced or manufactured in Australia. These amendments would go some way towards ensuring that these business tax concessions help transition business activity so that it helps create a fairer, cleaner and more stable economy and society. Both the government and the opposition have talked a big game about rebuilding manufacturing in Australia, but unless you actually direct policy so that businesses and the government spend on Australian-made goods then it's all just hot air. If these amendments are unsuccessful—given the government has chosen to rush the bill through—the responsible thing to do is to oppose this package, and that is what the Greens will do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We do support a number of measures in this bill. We support schedule 3 and the increase in the threshold of a range of tax concessions for small businesses so they'll be available for businesses earning up to $50 million a year. We also support schedules 4, 5 and 6, which deal with research and development tax incentives. These measures provide slightly larger tax benefits for companies that undertake research and development. It would have been far more prudent for the government to send this bill to an inquiry so as to give the Senate time to consider these changes and to make sure there are no unintended consequences. But of course the collusion of the major parties in this place to jam this bill through today, with almost no opportunity for scrutiny, means that we will not be able to do that. But we do support those measures in this bill that I've mentioned.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a perilously curious that Labor takes up the position that they do in this chamber—to the President's left, where the opposition traditionally sits—since they are by no means anymore a left-wing party and are an opposition in name only. Yesterday Senator Gallagher was complaining about how this is another omnibus bill that presents the Senate with a binary decision, and that puts Labor in an invidious position—hopelessly forced to vote for things they don't want to. Oh, the agony—the burden on the Labor Party is almost unbearable here! The Senate can split parts out of this bill, and we will give an opportunity for the Senate to do that in our amendments. There are seven schedules to this bill that deal separately with the personal income tax cuts, big business tax concessions, small business tax concessions, and R&amp;D tax concessions. If Labor wants to support one schedule, amend another or oppose another then Labor could draft amendments to achieve that aim. We've got some; we hope Labor support them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We then heard Senator McAllister talking about the failure of this budget to do anything to address the gender pay gap and, at the same time, Labor is cheering the government on to bring forward stage 2 of the tax cuts, in which 90 per cent of the benefit goes to people earning over $90,000, which means that men would get over twice as much of the benefit as women from these tax cuts. So, yes, this budget and this bill do nothing to address the gender pay gap and, in fact, make it worse, and that's in part because of the very tax cuts that Labor is going to queue up in here and support this morning.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And then there is government debt. Labor's leader, Mr Albanese, has spent the whole COVID crisis talking about the so-called debt burden and is then faced with the embarrassment of having agreed to the centrepiece of the budget before he even made his budget reply speech last night. He should have just got up last night and said 'ditto' and sat back down again.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's shadow Treasurer, Dr Chalmers, also spent a good portion of last year's election campaign talking about government debt levels. We then had yesterday in question time the astounding circumstance in which Senator Gallagher quoted no less a body than the IPA, the Institute of Public Affairs, in her questions when asking about the size of the debt. The Labor Party must've taken a time machine back to 1929. Have they not heard of John Maynard Keynes? Do they not understand the concept of countercyclical spending? Has the Labor Party so missed the moment in which the world is putting to sleep the deficit hawks that they have resorted to quoting the IPA in question time? How embarrassing for a once proud political party, quoting the IPA on government debt while voting for tax cuts for the millionaires. Labor has drunk the neoliberal Kool-Aid and has forgotten what the effects of these policies are on people, many of whom put their faith in the Labor Party at the ballot box.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens would have amended this bill to repeal stages 2 and 3 of the tax cuts, but our advice was that that was beyond the powers of the Senate, so our amendments will be as I categorised them earlier in my speech. I want to put on the record that, even though we do support elements of this legislation, taken as a whole, which I very much expect is what the Senate will require us to do—because of the dirty secret deal done on these tax cuts and on this legislation by the ALP and the government—we will not be able to split out elements of this bill and will be forced to take it as a package. If we are forced by the Senate to take this bill as a package, notwithstanding the fact that we do support elements of this legislation, as I outlined earlier, we will vote against this package because, on balance, the bad outweighs the good. We are not going to get up and swallow this neoliberal ideology based on the failed model of trickle-down economics, just because the major parties have done a deal to jam this legislation through with no opportunity for the Senate to run through its normal processes, no opportunity for an inquiry so that we can hear from people who would be impacted by this legislation. Once again, the trickle-down will win in this place, when we know that, after 40-odd years of trickle-down economics, the people who are doing it toughest in this country are still waiting with their palms outstretched for those first drops to trickle down into their hands. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:29</span>):  In making a few brief remarks on the Treasury Laws Amendment (A Tax Plan for the COVID-19 Economic Recovery) Bill 2020, I think it's very much worth highlighting that this bill really does fail the test of what we need at the moment in terms of a strong budget for our nation. We now have an opportunity to rebuild our nation during and after this pandemic and to reset some fundamental policy settings. But what this budget does and, indeed, what is most telling about the bill before us is not what is in it but, frankly, what is not in it. There is no real plan for Australian manufacturing in what the government has put forward. There is no plan for jobs and economic recovery. Instead, this government has put forward a plan for the nation that simply leaves people behind, as the Leader of the Opposition outlined very ably in his budget reply last night. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While Labor supports the measures before us today, it's timely for us to remember that we are aspiring to something much better as a nation. Nobody should be left behind, as this budget has left behind older Australians, as it's left behind our university students, as it's left behind the manufacturing industries of our nation, as it's left behind people who are facing unemployment and as it's left behind people whose job subsidies will expire. This year has been the year from hell for so many Australians, too many Australians, and this budget is not adept enough at drilling down into the solutions that we need for tomorrow: education and training, quality child care, rebuilding our manufacturing sector and powering our recovery with clean energy. It is time that we took on this crisis and really sought to pull the levers of change for the Australian people. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I condemn this government for not putting forward an adequate suite of policies and plans. But today, as we support this legislation as simply getting on with some of the basic things that need to be done, I highlight that it's high time that we had a real vision for our nation, as Anthony Albanese, the Leader of the Opposition, so ably put forward last night. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:33</span>):  The consideration of the Treasury Laws Amendment (A Tax Plan for the COVID-19 Economic Recovery) Bill 2020 occurs against the backdrop of the deepest recession since 1929. More than a million Australians are unemployed and, even on the government's own figures, 160,000 more Australians will lose their jobs between now and Christmas. The history of recessions in my lifetime charts the course of not just the economic development of the country but the character of the governments that presided over the recessions. The recession in the late 1970s and early 1980s, the Fraser and Howard recession, was a deep and lasting recession that caused untold damage to Australian families and Australian business.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was the Hawke-Keating period of the 1980s, and the opportunity they took coming out of the recession to rebuild the Australian economy, that told the story of that recovery: the accords, floating the Australian dollar, industry and industrial reform, entirely reconfiguring the Australian economy, Medicare and the social wage—enormous achievements that were opposed, of course, every step of the way by the characters on the other side of this chamber. They were big achievements—Senator Smith, don't shake your head—but they voted against all of them. These great achievements were made for the country in the middle of a recession, with the government using the opportunity to rebuild the Australian economy. The recession of the early 1990s that occurred when Hawke was the Prime Minister and Keating was the Treasurer is called the Hawke and Keating recession by those opposite. What was the Keating response? <span style="font-style:italic;">Working</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> nation</span>, one per cent of GDP spent on infrastructure and a plan for jobs. And what came out of that? Thirty years of economic growth. There has not been much reform in the intervening period, but we have had 30 years of economic growth.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, now we have the Morrison recession, with a trillion dollars in debt and unemployment continuing at very high rates for four years. And what will we have to show for it? We have a recession that will be deeper and longer because of the policy failings of this government. It will be the Morrison recession because of your policy failings and your lack of character in dealing with these deep national challenges. It will be deeper and longer because Scott Morrison, the Prime Minister, is going to cut the JobKeeper and JobSeeker programs that Labor argued for. JobKeeper has kept hundreds of thousands of Australians connected with their workplaces and it's kept tens of thousands of Australian businesses afloat, but the cuts in JobKeeper in the lead-up to March next year will mean that 160,000 Australians will lose their jobs between now and Christmas. And who knows how many thousands of Australian businesses will close? We'll have an insolvency-led recovery, perhaps.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You can't just announce your way out of a recession. You have to work your way out of a recession. The recession will be deeper and longer because of this trillion-dollar trickle-down budget, with four years of continued high unemployment and no jobs plan. The only plan that exists is shovelling hundreds of millions of dollars—billions of dollars—out the door to big business with a grab bag of announcements and no plan and hoping for the best. It's not the size of the deficit that counts in this situation; it's what you do with it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The recession will be deeper and longer because the economy was in diabolical trouble before the coronavirus pandemic landed on our shores. Wages were flatlining, job quality was declining, 1.8 million Australians were unemployed or looking for more work, productivity was falling and growth was flatlining. This is, no matter how much you wriggle, the Morrison recession. You broke it. You own it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We saw the spectacle of the Treasurer, Mr Frydenberg, invoking the desiccated, discredited economic icons of his—Margaret Thatcher and Ronald Reagan—three weeks ago. The Prime Minister wanted him to be quiet and not say that, but he really wanted to say it. He said it once. He said it twice. He said it three times. He wanted to talk about Maggie Thatcher and Ronald Reagan. But the truth is he did us all a favour, because it showed what's at the desiccated heart of this miserable budget: it's going to be a continuation of that trickle-down economic agenda. This is a trickle-down trillion-dollar budget, shovelling it out the door to business and hoping that it trickles down to ordinary people. I heard Senator Scarr and others say the other day that it's time for government to get out of the way. Well, this is hardly getting out of the way. It's a colossal failure of economic management and national government character.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We saw the contrast last night with the speech by the Leader of the Opposition: no-one held back, no-one left behind, practical nation-building initiatives that are going to make a real difference to Australian families and real reforms that are going to have a lifelong effect on Australian national productivity and capacity—rewiring the nation, getting past the climate wars between the maddest ends and the slightly less-mad ends of the coalition climate argument, which have held this country back. The coalition has had 22 energy policies since it was elected. We have a technology-neutral plan to modernise the Australian electricity system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've never been wound up before by the Leader of the Government in the Senate, but I will pay attention, given that it's your last day, Senator Cormann. We have a plan for manufacturing and building trains here in Australia, a jobs guarantee and a skills guarantee for Australian apprentices, and a childcare plan that just shows how little there was in the coalition budget for Australian women—a coalition budget that spent more in new spending on computers for Services Australia than on Australian women. They are practical initiatives, practical plans and a pathway to a better, fairer, more decent Australia.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WATERS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Australian Greens in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:41</span>):  I rise to speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (A Tax Plan for the COVID-19 Economic Recovery) Bill 2020, but it's not really a tax plan for the economic recovery of this nation; it's a plan for yet more handouts for big corporates: $99 billion in freebies to this government's corporate donor mates. They talk a big game, but the recipients and the beneficiaries of this tax package are abundantly clear. This bill locks in the transfer of hundreds of billions of dollars in corporate welfare at the expense of public services and people who need help. Despite the record spending, this tax cut package will leave so many Australians behind, and the centrepiece of the budget of course is bringing forward the tax cuts that this bill facilitates. Let's be clear about what these tax cuts do. They take hundreds of billions of dollars that could be going to fund child care, schools, universities, hospitals, public housing, frontline domestic and family violence services or renewable energy or to create jobs, repair the safety net for those out of work. But no: this bill takes that money and gives it to the corporations and the millionaires, not the millions who need it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government says the tax cuts are needed to get the economy moving, to put money in the pockets of everyday Australians. But the benefits of these tax cuts are not distributed evenly. Under this bill, 96 per cent of the tax cut package goes to the top 30 per cent of income earners. The bottom 70 per cent of the population gets just four per cent of the money. These tax cuts are a trickle-down con. And of course they benefit men twice as much as they do women. Low- and middle-income earners get a boost in one year. They get a $1,000 boost from the one-off extension of the LMITO, the low-and middle-income tax offset, but that's it. When LMITO runs out next year, that temporary benefit is gone, and the tax benefit for the well-off remains. It is a temporary boost for the millions but a permanent boost for the millionaires. And when the stage 3 tax cuts kick in—in four years time, as they're scheduled to do, thanks to the capitulation of the so-called opposition—50 per cent of the benefits will go to the top 10 per cent of income earners.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm sure Australians know that at the moment one in three of the biggest companies in this country pay no tax. Well, under this bill, that will go up to two out of three. It is absolutely outrageous. We should not be going into unprecedented debt, just to line the pockets of billionaires and companies that are already making healthy profits, while leaving behind young people, older workers, women, First Nations people, people with a disability and anyone who hasn't donated to the Liberal Party. And of course tax cuts mean nothing if you don't have a job. This government is offering the trinket of 20 bucks a week to low-income earners but it's just taken $150 a week out of the pockets of everyone on JobSeeker or JobKeeper. It's offering tax cuts to Clive Palmer but next to nothing to families trying to put food on the table. In a recession where one million people are unemployed, there is no justification for bringing forward tax cuts for millionaires.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">According to the budget papers, the cost of these tax cuts when all the stages are implemented will be around $50 billion a year. A government with vision and leadership would use that kind of money to create a future for all of us. For about half that increase in debt we could fund 100 per cent renewable energy, we could reinvigorate the manufacturing sector with green hydrogen, we could have free child care, we could have free education—tertiary, secondary, from a very early stage right through people's lives. We could build one million new public houses to put a roof over the head of every person in this country, and we could lift people out of poverty by giving everyone in this country an income they can actually live on. We could make sure that we have world-class, affordable health care, that carers are properly rewarded, that everyone has access to public transport. We could reinvigorate the manufacturing sector with clean energy and green hydrogen. We could make sure that any person subject to abuse—because we know that has spiked since the onset of COVID—could access support services, crisis accommodation, and financial and legal advice when and where they need it. All of this could happen if we made millionaires and big corporations pay their fair share and invest in a green recovery. So we will not be supporting this bill and we will continue to fight for the millions, not the millionaires. We will fight for gender equality, sustainable industry and a fairer future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My colleague Senator McKim has already outlined the amendments that we will be moving in this place. We will move to defer the tax cut for millionaires, because in a recession, when you've just cut JobSeeker and JobKeeper, tax cuts for millionaires should not be rammed through the Senate two days after the bill was introduced to parliament, with no Senate inquiry, because you are trying to sail through and cover up the fact that 96 per cent of the benefits go to those who do not need any extra help. If you've got $99 billion in the bottom drawer for your corporate mates, why on earth have you just cut JobSeeker and JobKeeper? If you want stimulus, you should have kept those measures at their temporary boosted rate. All of the economists say that; there is no dispute about that. Investing in housing, investing in child care—investing in people!—is how you actually help this nation and get the economy going. So we'll be moving that amendment, but unfortunately we know that the so-called opposition has once again capitulated to the government, who will just ram through these tax cuts for millionaires. Sadly, we don't expect any support from the opposition on that amendment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The instant asset write-off is a policy we supported in the past, when it had appropriate limits, as a policy that genuinely helps small business, stimulates business spending and helps out local manufacturing. But we will be moving an amendment to make sure that big coal, big gas, and tobacco and defence manufacturers cannot access it. Boosting accelerated depreciation and allowing companies to write off capital expenditure should go to supporting a green recovery. Those things should go to supporting products that are manufactured here in Australia. That's the other amendment we'll move. If you want to get an instant asset write-off of 100 per cent, you should be buying Australian-made goods. I think the opposition leader alluded to something similar in his speech last night. Are the Labor Party actually going to vote for that amendment? It's a very sensible amendment, but we'll see if, once again, they're all talk and no follow-through.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other amendment that we'll move is to make sure that these tax cuts are not brought forward. The loss-carry-back provisions could have been good for small business, but the government hasn't given this chamber the time to scrutinise them, so I'm afraid we will have to oppose those. They will be an excuse for yet more tax minimisation by big corporates. We'll also be moving that the instant asset write-off stays where it is. We think a cap of $150,000 for expenditure by companies with a turnover of up to $500 million is a fair place to draw the line. That helps small business, but this government wants to lift that to businesses that earn up to $5 billion in turnover—yet another handout for big corporates who don't need the help. And the government has just cut JobSeeker! The contrast could not be more stark.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a government for its big corporate donors, and the rest of Australia is crying out for some help, for some vision and for some leadership. Well, we here in the Greens are happy to deliver that. We will oppose this bill. There are parts of it that we would have supported but, of course, the government is putting it through as a whole. We would have inquired into this bill, and its flagrant support for the millionaires would have been revealed. Perhaps the opposition would have decided to be an opposition if they had taken the time to see the impacts of these tax cuts. But there was no Senate inquiry; it's being rammed through. We're here on an unscheduled sitting day, debating a package which will benefit the top 30 per cent of income earners when the government has just cut JobSeeker. Shame on this government! The Australian public knows that its priorities are its corporate donors and the fancy corporate jobs that government members can go off to after politics. This community deserves better after the hell of a year that we've all suffered through, and the government has delivered them a kick in the teeth.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:50</span>):  As a servant to the people of Queensland and Australia, I speak in support of the Treasury Laws Amendment (A Tax Plan for the COVID-19 Economic Recovery) Bill 2020. This is an omnibus bill, as everyone knows, and it covers many topics. I'll cover many of them and I'll widen it to include the budget context needed for these to be effective. Where are these measures and the budget taking our country? Where are the budget's crafters taking our country?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">First of all, I'd like to start with sharing my feelings and needs when I listened to two of our staffers who were in the budget lockdown, who were sharing the details they learned in that lockdown. I was actually stunned and quite concerned—deeply concerned in fact—because it undermined my faith in the governance of this country. It didn't meet my needs for integrity, reassurance, security and leadership: I want to make that very clear. I also, though, want to acknowledge that last Wednesday, two days ago, was the 10th anniversary of my first personal challenge to the Greens, and I'll discuss more of that later.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Firstly, the personal tax cuts have been brought forward and backdated. That could offset big tax bills at the end of the year for people on JobKeeper. We wondered about the timing, but nonetheless we applaud bringing forward those tax cuts. On pensions: there will be two lots of $250 each in December and in March. There is an assumption in the budget—one of many critical assumptions—that there will be a vaccine in July 2021. That indicates no plan for managing COVID. Instead, we will continue in this country to have COVID managing us.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On the JobMaker scheme: for those under 20 there will be a $200-a-week subsidy paid to employers. For those between 30 and 35 there will be $100 a week. Nothing is being done for the 30 per cent of people who are over 55. That's age discrimination, but it could also lead to retail churn. The retail sector is known to do that, jumping on these incentives, so that is a concern to us and it will need to be managed. Now, I understand that this is a budget bill so there will not be much opportunity to change it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On immigration: in 2018-19 there were 240,000 net migrants coming into our country. In 2019-20 that dropped to 154,000. This year, 2020-21, there will be minus 72,000—largely, we presume, because of overseas students leaving. In 2021-22 it starts to climb back up again and in 2022-23 we're back to our huge numbers of immigrants. That is of concern. GDP in the last decade has increased because of immigration—nothing about productivity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With the instant write-off measure, anything can be written off and any company can get it—a company with a turnover of up to $5 billion, including foreign companies. So where will that money be going? Little has changed on revenue. There is $22 billion from tobacco and alcohol. Tobacco will make up $15.3 billion of that, and that could drive more people to drugs for cheaper thrills. That will mean more danger and harm to society. We have to question some of the underlying assumptions and presumptions in the budget, not only this year but moving into the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On infrastructure: Emu Swamp Dam is not yet ready to be approved, but we applaud the government for funding this. We think it's necessary. It's absolutely vital for the people of Stanthorpe and South-East Queensland. But there are no nation-building programs—no hybrid Bradfield and no WA pipeline bringing the gas east. There is no vision for our future. On roads and bridges: we'll be upgrading existing roads, but there's nothing to improve productivity and create future national wealth. Not one project in this budget goes beyond the life of this budget.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On manufacturing strategy: we see that there's the $1.3 billion Modern Manufacturing Initiative. That's a nice slogan, nice words. It sounds good. There's also investment in supply chain resilience. How are we going to do this with the world's dearest electricity? How can we do that when manufacturing costs are so dependent on cheap electricity? That's why our jobs have gone from here to places like China, India and Asia. We have gone from having the cheapest electricity in the world to having the dearest because of government regulations from the Labor Party, the Labor-Greens coalition government with Julia Gillard, and the Liberal-National coalition government under John Howard and subsequent prime ministers. The budget says it wants to process agricultural products here. Where's the water? We need water.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we come to the job forecasts. For each large initiative in the budget there was a forecast of the number of jobs that would be created. Our staff put together a tally. The total number of jobs is more than the current total number of unemployed, trainees and apprentices. The jobs in the budget don't add up. Are these empty, hollow projections meant to grab headlines for each initiative?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On tax: Senator Hanson has been pursuing multinationals to be taxed fairly in this country for 2½ decades. I've joined her in the last five years. Multinationals continue to avoid tax. Gas exporters export our wealth and pay virtually no tax here, yet the Japanese government collects $3 billion from our gas imports into Japan. The big end of town has been given the right to claim back tax that they have already paid. Losses in 2019-20 and 2020-21 can be reclaimed from tax already paid in 2018-19. In response to One Nation exposing the multinationals paying little or no tax, for years this government has pretended to chase foreign corporations to pay their fair share of tax. This produced a small increase in tax from people like Google and Apple. Now the government is giving it all back. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australian companies and employers continue to be at a 30 per cent disadvantage because multinationals are not paying tax. The Liberal, Labor, National and Greens governments have served the multinationals by avoiding this issue. The Greens talk about it, but when in power with Julia Gillard they didn't do anything about it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Tax reform is an essential topic that we must face up to, including state payroll tax. We need a summit. We need to get back to the Constitution's competitive federalism and give the states their power.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I see it, this budget has some worthwhile initiatives, but it is largely headline grabbing and smoke and mirrors, all to look good but not to do good. It's a budget the marketing people built to grab headlines—people with limited understanding of the basic production needs of a healthy economy, a healthy society and a healthy community, and the basic production needs for business and investment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's start with what a productive economic environment needs. First of all it needs cheap electricity. Human progress has been a result of ever-decreasing costs of energy, including electricity. Coalition electricity plans a few months ago started off with coal being prime. That was around the election time. They caught up with One Nation and started using our mantra of pushing coal. Just about a month ago they released a new plan full of unreliables—you might know them as renewables—and gas. There was no mention of coal. And just a couple of weeks ago they mentioned future technologies—$15 billion to be wasted on unproven, high-cost, inefficient and inherently impossible energy, because these energy generators consume more energy than they produce. In a recession, $15 billion will be spent on a folly to grab headlines.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've discussed the Moran report, written by notable economist Dr Alan Moran. He cannot be refuted because his figures simply consolidate figures from budget documents—from state and federal government department and agency documents. They show there is an extra $13 billion on top of basic electricity charges in this country due to unreliables—in other words, renewables. That works out at an average of $1,300 per household per year, every year. The government's figure of 6½ per cent of the typical family household electricity bill being due to renewables is not true; it is 39 per cent. No wonder people are hurting. This is a highly regressive tax on the poor and the vulnerable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Dr Moran referenced studies showing that for every so-called green energy job created 2.2 jobs are lost in the real economy—the productive economy. He also recently calculated, conservatively, the average subsidy for wind turbines in this country at $536,000 per turbine per year for 15-year contracts. At the end of 2019 there were 2,691 wind turbines in Australia. That equates to $21.6 billion in subsidies in their short and environmentally damaging lifetime. The world's most astute and successful investor is Warren Buffett. He says that wind turbines are a poor investment; he wouldn't touch them. But, he says, wind turbines are a fabulous investment with subsidies, because of their guaranteed income. There you have it—unproductive, soon-to-be blights on the environment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we see the Prime Minister's coalition ally, the Leader of the Opposition in Queensland, Deb Frecklington, coming up with a plan yesterday to splurge almost $500 million in subsidies to subsidise electricity costs for manufacturing businesses. How the hell can we lower the cost of power by subsidising it? So we're going to subsidise the reduction to offset the subsidies that are causing these unreliables to raise prices. Donald Trump has proven the importance of affordable energy. He had driven the American economic recovery remarkably until COVID hit. All he has done is enable cheap energy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second thing we need is reliable water. The third thing we need is comprehensive tax reform. The fourth thing we need is industrial relations laws to be enforced but also simplified, to make it easy and less risky to hire people. We need to stop exploiting pseudo-casuals; we need the Labor Party to step up and do its work there and help us hold the government accountable. The IR system has completely broken down in this country because it's not being enforced; it's being allowed to be bypassed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to address red tape, green tape, blue tape and purple tape—blue tape being UN tape and purple tape being policies that are based on academic falsehoods and misrepresentations. We need an office of science integrity and quality assurance. And we need to end PC—political correctness—and be real and truthful based on data. Facts beat feelings. Feelings lead to fear. Facts and data liberate. As it stands now this budget is not about democracy; it is about hypocrisy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In summary, there are some minor positive initiatives in the budget. There is nothing to create an economic environment for Australian investment. There is nothing to increase productive capacity. There is nothing to restore economic sovereignty. We have gone in this country from independence to dependence via the UN's mantra of interdependence, which is really dependence. There is nothing in this budget for productivity improvements—the source of all wealth and higher living standards. There is nothing to address the basics. We're pleased, in One Nation, that the Prime Minister and Treasurer are using One Nation concepts and terms—'productive capacity', 'economic sovereignty'—but they need action, not hollow words. Instead of many slogans, we need real action. The 'Prime Minister from marketing' is starting to become known as the 'Prime Minister for announcements'. There is no direction, there is no strategy. There is not even a narrative in this budget.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also need a plan for managing COVID—a real plan. We can't just keep letting COVID manage us. There's no plan A let alone a plan B alternative. We must get back to that. The core disease in this country that I see is coming from Canberra and some of the states—that is, there is no major policy that is data driven. That is the crux of our problem. Everything is ideologically driven, emotionally driven, fantasy driven, slogan driven and lies driven. Climate catastrophe, mass extinction, living through collapse, cooking the planet—this is the stuff that comes from the south end of a northbound bull. It's now 10 years since I first challenged Senator Larissa Waters to produce the evidence for her claims and her misrepresentations of science, climate and humanity. Until we get to the truth, we will continue living in a fantasy.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="144292" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator PATRICK</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:06</span>):  I rise to speak on the Treasury Laws Amendment (A Tax Plan for the COVID-19 Economic Recovery) Bill 2020; however, I do so from a rather uninformed position. This bill proposes $49 billion of lost tax receipts and has an explanatory memorandum which is 166 pages, and we've had no opportunity to scrutinise the bill. One might ask the question: why is that the case? Well, it's not what Senator Polley suggested, where she said the lack of scrutiny lay squarely at the feet of the coalition. That is completely wrong. It's the role of the opposition to scrutinise what the government does.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will be the subject of no scrutiny because Labor agreed with the government to let the bill go through the chamber today. Senator Gallagher says that Labor will look at the provisions of the bill at estimates. I agree that that is where you will uncover faults and unintended consequences, but you will not be able to change anything. You know that. You say it's to get the money flowing. This is $49 billion of tax receipts that we are giving up, and you couldn't wait five weeks of scrutineering time, including estimates, before you capitulated. So I'm thinking of assisting the Labor Party in its marketing. I'm going to go out and help you find a mascot. It's going to be a dog, and it's going to be a dog that rolls over. It's going to be one that rolls over the moment any member of the coalition walks into the room. Your response in this regard is inconsistent with the very good speech that Mr Albanese delivered last night in the other place. It was a good opposition speech. He talked the talk last night. This morning, you're back to the usual not walking the walk.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Moving to the bill, I do have some concerns in relation to assumptions that underlie this bill. We should, rightfully, get to understand the assumptions before we make decisions on the bill. There is an assumption in the budget that is talking about a population-wide COVID-19 vaccine program being fully in place by 2021. As I said last night, we've seen optimism when talking about a vaccine; dates have been given and then extended, and then extended, and then extended again. According to Mr Trump we should have a vaccine next month, by November. We need to be very careful. Vaccines do take a long time to develop and test properly. The budget also talks about limited international travel, but we don't know the full picture.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In these sorts of situations, we should be hoping for the best and planning for the worst. I'm concerned about the sensitivity of the economic forecasting. I mentioned last night that in the 2019-20 budget there was a number in there on the price of iron ore, $55 a tonne—that was Treasury's estimates. We've gone through a significant international crisis, and then I look into these budget papers and the same assumption is sitting there; it's going to be $55 a tonne. So I'm a bit concerned.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also note that there are numbers of jobs quoted in the budget papers but no real explanation as to how those came about. So, with my caveat in place about the lack of scrutiny, I'm prepared to say that unlike the job-ready graduate bill this bill does have some good points, but caution is required.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are bringing forward personal income tax thresholds. That will provide immediate benefit with the reduction in PAYG. However, I am concerned about the skewing of these tax cuts towards the wealthy who will likely bank their additional tax rather than spend it, which is the purpose for which we're granting the tax cut—to provide stimulus. So I will be looking at the Greens' amendments. They've only just been circulated. I will certainly be giving them some consideration.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On the full expensing of depreciating assets: in the 45th Parliament I went through the corporate tax cuts arguments. At that point in time, the alternative suggestion to simply dropping the corporate tax rates was in fact to look at things like depreciating assets. It wasn't an acceptable proposition for the government, so it is interesting that they have included this measure—$26 billion of measures. I am a bit concerned that we might see a large proportion of those funds simply go overseas as we import equipment and so forth.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On the temporary loss carry-back: this gives a helping hand to profitable businesses that have been paying their taxes and have fallen on hard times as a result of COVID-19. That seems quite reasonable. However—and this is a perverse but unintended benefit—there are those companies that have been rorting the system and paying no tax that will get no benefit out of this, so that's a good thing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This budget will deliver a net debt of $703 billion this year, rising to an eye-watering $1 trillion in 2024. Debt is not necessarily evil as long as it is incurred obtaining something that will provide tangible benefit for the future and the debt can be repaid. These changes result in the forecast loss of tax receipts or income for the government of $8,440,000,000 for this financial year and $49,725,000,000 over the forward estimates. You've just got to ask the question: how do these tax cuts fit into a plan for Australia? Is this consistent with some clear vision for Australia? I question the underlying basis for some of the decisions. I remember when the tax cuts were being proposed just after the election. The economy was strong and there were calls from the government saying, 'This is the perfect time to reduce PAYG, because the economy is strong.' Now we're in a recession, there's been an international crisis and the government is saying, 'This is the perfect time to have PAYG relief.' People might question how you come to the same conclusion with completely different sets of circumstances, so that in itself is perhaps a little bit worrying.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then there's a flip-flopping concern that I have raised in this budget. The loss carry-back is a case of back to the past—a recommendation from the Henry review implemented by the Gillard government then repealed by the Abbott government and now it is back.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then there is the R&amp;D tax incentive. The history of cutting back the R&amp;D tax incentives is interesting; it is the classic flip-flop strategy—originally I said no then I said yes then I said no and I have stuck to it. It has a bit more gravitas this time because it was no by a government chaired committee then yes with this latest government bill on R&amp;D and then no, as just advised by the Treasurer. The question is: will they stick to it?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's clear the government will be receiving less money. Therefore, we have to be very diligent about how we might spend that money. We must make sure we get bang for buck as we move forward to get the best results for our economy. Ultimately, I will support this bill, perhaps with amendments but definitely with some reservations.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Australian Greens Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:16</span>):  I rise to contribute to the debate on the Treasury Laws Amendment (A Tax Plan for the COVID-19 Economic Recovery) Bill 2020. We are sitting an extra day so this can be rammed through the parliament without any scrutiny before estimates, before there is a committee inquiry. The Greens did try to refer this bill to committee but neither the government nor the opposition supported a Senate inquiry into the very deep ramifications of this bill. This bill amends the income tax payable by individuals in the 2020-21 income year and later income years by bringing forward changes to income tax thresholds.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's call this bill out for what it is: the coalition accelerating personal tax cuts for millionaires, while millions of unemployed people get nothing. These tax cuts give $2,500 to millionaires, while unemployed and underemployed people basically get a kick in the teeth. Neither the government nor the opposition made commitments to people who are unemployed, stuck on JobSeeker, during either the budget or, in the opposition's case, the budget-in-reply. Jobseekers are desperate to know what their future holds. Of course, they want jobs; they do want to be employed, but the reality is we will continue to see a high rate of unemployment for a long time to come. At the moment, both the government and opposition seem to be quite okay about not giving those people any surety about their future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Treasurer mentioned jobseekers a whole three times in the budget speech, but none of those three times did he give any signal to those who are currently trying to survive on JobSeeker and the reduced coronavirus supplement. At no time did the Treasurer give them any surety that they will in fact not be condemned to $40 a day in December or any surety that the government would ensure they do not end up low the poverty line.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation is short-sighted. It is a sugar hit with no evidence it will generate economic stimulus, because the bulk of the money is going to the already well-off. Where is the evidence to show these tax cuts will actually stimulate the economy? There is literally no guarantee that high-income earners, who stand to benefit the most from these changes, will go out and spend the extra money, particularly while the borders are still closed. Even so, the evidence suggests they will save it, whereas those on JobSeeker will spend the bulk of the money because they need to make ends meet. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Most economists agree that tax cuts won't be as effective in getting us out of this recession. We are here today, on a Friday, to debate tax cuts that are going to give the least to people who already have the least, increasing inequality in this country. I'm urging all Australians: don't be fooled by the spin and the promise of this sugar hit. These tax cuts aren't what you think they are. In fact, low- and middle-income earners will lose their extra thousand dollars a year next year, while the rich get to keep their tax cuts. From 2021-22, 96 per cent of the net benefit of the tax cuts will go to the top 30 per cent, while the bottom 70 per cent will be left with only four per cent. Furthermore, these tax cuts hurt women, delivering, from 2021-22, $2.28 to men for every dollar they deliver to women.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's just have a look at job creation. The government has predicted that the tax cuts will cost $16.9 billion in the next financial year alone and create 50,000 jobs. But research undertaken by the Australia Institute shows that if we invested that $16.9 billion evenly across the employment-intensive sectors of university education, child care, health care, aged care, which we desperately need, and the creative arts we would generate—listen to this—210,506 jobs. That is a whopping 160,506 more jobs than the tax cuts will generate. It seems like a very good investment to me—not only would we stimulate the economy but, more importantly, we would get so many more people back into work. Also, we'd improve aged care, health care and the arts, which, as Senator Hanson-Young has so clearly articulated in this place, have so far been left behind. And, of course, it would improve university education, which we already know this government is at war with. Not only would this create investment in the care economy and create more jobs; it would also ensure that we had teachers, childcare workers, nurses and aged-care workers to deliver those essential services. I'm deeply disappointed that the government has missed such a critical opportunity to invest in our care economy. That is where we will generate jobs. That is where we can start to make changes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill does not represent a long-term investment in the future of all Australians. It picks a lucky few based on their high income and, as a result, only serves to increase and exacerbate inequality in this country. This government is going to entrench and widen inequality when it has the opportunity to address that issue. Income inequality and wealth inequality are already rife in this country. They were rife before COVID hit and will only be made worse by this budget and these tax cuts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Somebody in a household that falls in the highest 20 per cent income group has six times as much as someone in the lowest 20 per cent income group. This is the situation here. The average income of the highest five per cent income group is nine times that of the lowest 20 per cent income group. People in the highest 20 per cent income group receive 42 per cent of all national income. People in the lowest 20 per cent income group receive only six per cent of all household income. The highest five per cent wealth group have average wealth of $6 million. The wealth of the highest one per cent wealth group averages $14 million. Australia has the fifth-highest number of people in the world with ultrahigh wealth, more than US$500 million. People who have the highest incomes in the world and are the most wealthy don't need tax cuts.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Bringing forward tax cuts while simultaneously cutting the coronavirus supplement by $300 a fortnight is heartbreaking for people on the JobSeeker payment. My heart goes out to all those Australians who are struggling at the moment. Hundreds of people have contacted my office already to express their distress and anguish at the thought that the JobSeeker payment is going back to $40 a day in December, and the government have made no guarantee that it won't; they have given no certainty to the people on JobSeeker. But they say: 'It's okay, you millionaires; you're going to get your tax cut. Don't you worry; we'll give you certainty.' To those on low incomes it's: 'We'll try and fool Australia that you're getting money too, but we're going to take that extra $1,000 off you next year. Don't you worry, jobseekers; we'll keep you in uncertainty because that's what's good for you. Don't you worry. We're looking after the millionaires, we're guaranteeing them money, but we're not going to guarantee money for you jobseekers because there may be a job for you in the future.' We already know there are 12 people applying for every job at the moment and we know that's not going to improve.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a bad budget. This is bad legislation. You've put a few good things in there which, as Senator McKim has highlighted, we could support. But, of course, you don't put them separately, you put them with these massive, offensive tax cuts for the wealthy while you deliver nothing for jobseekers. You kick jobseekers in the teeth. They have no certainty. The people trying to get by are going forward to Christmas looking at trying to survive on $40 a day. Well, 'Thanks for nothing,' will be their message to you.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator HANSON-YOUNG</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:26</span>):  I rise to contribute to this debate today and I want to start with the title of this bill: 'A Tax Plan for the COVID-19 Economic Recovery'. That's the first con job. The bill does nothing to deal with the economic crisis that we are confronted with today. Why is that? Because we're in an economic crisis from this pandemic because we have a million people out of work. We have people from the hospitality sector, the retail sector, the tourism sector, from the arts and entertainment industries who have all lost their jobs because of the restrictions and the health response that was needed. We are in a recession that overwhelmingly impacts young people. We are in a recession that overwhelmingly impacts women. We are in a recession where it is the working poor and the unemployed in this country who are carrying the burden. And what does this bill do? It doesn't address any of those economic crises. It doesn't make life better for the unemployed. It spends tens of billions of dollars helping people who are actually managing okay at the moment. The millionaires of this country are doing pretty well in comparison with those who have lost their job.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation confronts us with choices. If the government have made a decision to spend billions of dollars and get that out the door to try and stimulate the economy in the midst of this economic crisis, they need to make choices as to where that money goes. What the government have decided to do in this budget and with this bill is to choose the wealthy over the poor. They have chosen men over women. They've chosen mining executives over aged-care workers. They've chosen millionaires over those people who have lost their jobs. This government's choices are clear, stark and rooted in an obscene ideology that says if you are at the bottom end of the income scale, that's your fault.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This budget and this bill, these tax cuts, are rooted in the belief that money will trickle down. We know that's not true; that is a con job. Trickle-down economics has been proven time and time again to deliver nothing for those who are on low incomes, those who are unemployed, the sick, the elderly, those who rely on public services. Let's make no mistake, tax cuts today mean service cuts tomorrow. What does that mean in reality? Less health care, less funding for education and less support and funding for aged care—the services that, when you're in the midst of a pandemic and an economic crisis, the country needs. Fifty billion dollars a year is to be spent on tax cuts for the rich people, and yet the unemployed get nothing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And of course we know that this government has, all the way through this pandemic and this crisis, chosen men over women. It is women who predominantly have lost their jobs in the midst of this crisis, in those sectors like retail, hospitality, the arts, entertainment and tourism. And yet where has the money and the support from this government gone? It's gone to the jobs for the boys: mining companies; expanding the gas industry; construction. Every time the Prime Minister gets up he talks about helping the tradies. Yet it's women in this country who carry the financial burden of this crisis. And what has the government done for them? Nothing. These tax cuts predominantly go to high-income earners. Who does that mean? Men.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government has made choices today that prioritise the rich over the poor, men over women and millionaires over the unemployed. This is not the type of response we need if we are to get out of this economic crisis. All the economists say that. But the government is blinded by its own ideology.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Fifty billion dollars a year—imagine what that money could be spent on if it were invested more wisely. This is about choice, and—rather than giving money to the rich and leaving the poor with nothing; rather than prioritising high-income earners and men over women; rather than prioritising millionaires over the unemployed—imagine what $50 billion a year could do. We could be investing in our education system. We could be making sure our aged-care system has well-paid staff to care for our elderly. We could have well-funded hospitals to make sure our healthcare system—in the middle of a health crisis—actually delivers the services we need.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So I am strongly opposed to this piece of legislation, because the government's choices in this crisis are backwards: rich over poor; men over women; millionaires over the unemployed. If you want to know what this government stands for, it stands for greed.</span>

This bill, the Treasury Laws Amendment (A Tax Plan for the COVID-19 Economic Recovery) Bill 2020, is the foundation of our plan to get Australia out of this COVID recession. It brings forward income tax relief for hardworking Australians by putting more money into their pockets, which will help boost aggregate demand and help facilitate the strongest possible economic and jobs recovery. It also provides incentives and encouragement to business to invest in their future growth and success, because of course a growing and successful business will hire more Australians.</span>

We'll just make a brief explanation of our amendment and put them as quickly as we can. The Greens oppose schedule 1 in the following terms:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This amendment registers the Greens opposition to the bringing forward of the personal tax cuts. I remind the Senate that, for low- and middle-income earners, their extra $1,000 will disappear in a year, while the very wealthy get to keep their tax cuts forever, and that after a year 96 per cent of the net benefit of these tax cuts goes to the top 30 per cent of income earners while the bottom 70 per cent of income earners will be left with only four per cent of the total benefit. And these tax cuts hurt women; they deliver $2.28 to men for every one dollar they deliver to women after this year's sugar hit.

We should absolutely be using this money to do a whole range of things, including JobSeeker and JobKeeper in full. I just cannot understand why the Labor Party in the middle of the worst recession for a century would support an accelerated tax cut for millionaires while millions of Australians are unemployed or underemployed.</span>

I want to be very clear that the Greens do not outright oppose instant asset write-off facilities or the introduction of loss-carry-back measures, but the government's policy, and this legislation taken as a whole, fails to be strategic and fails to put these measures together with a more comprehensive suite of reforms that deal with the real structural problems that exist in regard to corporate policy in this country. We might have supported these measures as part of a different package that made them more effective as stimulus measures and more effective as measures to transform the economy, and we're particularly predisposed to supporting particular measures that would help small business, but we are not interested in facilitating yet more corporate welfare in our country.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:58</span>):  The Greens policies have killed Australian manufacturing. This is nothing but a hypocritical, virtue-signalling charade. I have a good friend in Sydney, John MacRae. He is 75 years of age and is very well versed in the history of Australia, especially Australian industry. He has taken me around Sydney and shown me the places where factories used to make lathes and milling machines. Seafood canneries were once one after the other in southern Sydney. That has been killed because of policies driven by the Greens party, especially energy policy. This is nothing short of a hypocritical stunt. It's nothing short of Greens virtue signalling.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australian businesses are so short of Australian manufactured machines which they can depreciate that they have to buy overseas, because of these guys. When these guys are banning the depreciation of non-Australian assets, they're hurting Australian businesses. They don't even understand that. They don't understand what they're doing to the country at all. We want farmers, small businesses and large businesses in this country to be able to depreciate the assets they bought. We would want Australian manufacturing, but there is no manufacturing of so many of the assets that Australians have to buy these days. This is cold, thoughtless and shallow, and it's dishonest.</span>

I will be voting against this, and I'm calling on the government to start making governance decisions based on hard data so that we can get this country back again. Instead of hypocrisy, we need democracy.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Approximately 2.3 million Australians currently receive the coronavirus supplement. In July, it was estimated that the coronavirus supplement was supporting over 1.1 million children. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The coronavirus supplement was initially paid at the rate of $550 a fortnight from March to September. This ensured that people on JobSeeker Payment and Youth Allowance were receiving income support payments above the poverty line for the first time in a long time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">On 25 September 2020, the Government reduced the coronavirus supplement from $550 a fortnight to $250 a fortnight. Millions of Australians saw a reduction in their incomes taking those on Jobseeker Payment and Youth Allowance below the poverty line. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The pandemic continues to cause pain and suffering for so many Australians who have become unemployed due to this crisis. The reality is that Australia is still in a recession and this is not going to go away overnight, suffering the effects of Covid-19.  </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Greens are introducing this Bill because the Government has failed to provide certainty about the future of the coronavirus supplement and the base rate of JobSeeker Payment post-December. The Minister for Social Services has made it clear that there will be no increase to the base rate of JobSeeker in the October Budget. Australians receiving income support payments have no clarity about the future of these payments come Christmas time. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Let me be very clear, the Government's refusal to provide certainty to those on JobSeeker Payment is driven by ideology, not evidence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">There is an abundance of evidence that retaining the coronavirus supplement at $550 a fortnight will improve people's health and mental wellbeing, reduce housing stress, help build people's financial security, and contribute to economic stimulus. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">By retaining the coronavirus supplement at $550 a fortnight, this Bill would generate the economic stimulus we desperately need by increasing the incomes of over 2.3 million Australians. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Deloitte Access Economics report on estimating the economic impacts of lowering current levels of income support payments found that the reduction of the coronavirus supplement will reduce the size of the economy by $31.3 billion and see an average loss of 145,000 Full Time Equivalent jobs. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We know that every dollar the Government invests in income support payments generates a significant economic return because people on low incomes spend the majority of their income on essentials. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Unfortunately, this Government would rather prioritise bringing forward tax cuts for the wealthy instead of increasing income support payments. This is despite the evidence that shows people on higher incomes tend to save additional income. There is widespread agreement that tax cuts for the rich are less effective in generating economic stimulus. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The evidence in Anglicare Australia's Rental Affordability Snapshot Special Update shows that the rental market continues to fail people on income support payments. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">When the coronavirus supplement was $550 a fortnight, people on JobSeeker Payment could afford just 1% of rentals. Now that the supplement is $250 a fortnight, rental affordability has plummeted to 0.2%. Anglicare Australia predicts that if income support payments return to their pre-covid levels in December, a person out of work will find that 0% of rentals are affordable. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Government is condemning unemployed Australians to experience rental and mortgage stress in the middle of a pandemic. Retaining the coronavirus supplement at $550 a fortnight may not fix rental affordability overnight, but it does work towards reducing rental stress for people on JobSeeker Payment. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The evidence also shows that poverty acts as a significant barrier to employment. The Government cannot expect people will be able to effectively look for work when income support payments are below the poverty line. Looking for a job costs money and this will be felt even more acutely following the reintroduction of mutual obligations. Everyone needs enough money to dress appropriately for interviews, cover the cost of transport, and pay for phone and internet access. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The reality is that when JobSeeker Payment goes back to $40 a day, most people won't have enough money to cover the basics let alone cover the cost of undertaking job searches. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The reduction of the coronavirus supplement by $300 a fortnight is having a devastating impact on people's mental and physical wellbeing. Low rates of income support payments are a key contributor to poor health and wellbeing outcomes and lead to unfair and avoidable health inequalities. Long-term unemployment has significant impacts on people's mental health including increased risk of anxiety and depression, social isolation, and alienation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The uncertainty around the future rate of JobSeeker Payment is exacerbating people's mental health issues during a pandemic and a recession when people are already under immense stress and pressure. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill will invest in people's mental and physical health by ensuring people on JobSeeker Payment have enough money to afford the essentials, look for work, and get back on their feet after the recession. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I am deeply concerned that the Government does not understand the demographic makeup of people on JobSeeker Payment and this is leading to certain groups experiencing further distress. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Last week, the Parliamentary Budget Office found that the share of long-term recipients of JobSeeker Payment has grown over time, especially among women. By 2019, 33% of women aged over 55 had been on JobSeeker Payment for 5 years or more. Women over the age of 60 years old also made up more than 8% of total JobSeeker recipients in 2019. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It's clear that older people, especially women, are at risk of long-term unemployment. They are more likely to transition from JobSeeker Payment to the Age Pension, especially during a recession where jobs are scarce. This has a negative impact on their personal lives, wellbeing, living standards and retirement plans. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Retaining the rate of the coronavirus supplement at $550 a fortnight would have a direct and significant impact on older workers who are very unlikely to work again. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill seeks to address a significant gap in the Government's coronavirus response – the fact that Disability Support Pension recipients did not receive the coronavirus supplement. By extending the coronavirus supplement to Disability Support Pensioners, we recognise that disabled people face increased living costs due to the pandemic and need extra support at this time. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill also extends the coronavirus supplement to Age Pensioners receiving Commonwealth Rent Assistance to recognise the additional hardship experienced by older renters, especially women, who are often living in poverty. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">There have been widespread benefits from setting the coronavirus supplement at $550 a fortnight. People have been able to escape homelessness and family violence, put healthy food on the table, and get their car fixed so they can travel to work or study once it becomes available. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The road out of the recession is going to be long and bumpy. History tells us that we will continue to see high rates of unemployment and underemployment for some time. The Government cannot rely on cherry-picked data showing signs of early recovery, especially when we do not have a vaccine for Covid-19, as a justification for winding back critical income support. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Now is not the time to be cutting income support payments. Australians need the coronavirus supplement to continue, at the full rate, so they can continue to pay their rent, put food on the table, and buy essential medications.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Australians have a right to certainty and clarity about the future of income support payments, especially across the Christmas period and into the new year, while we work towards a permanent increase to the base rate of JobSeeker Payment and Youth Allowance to bring these payments permanently above the poverty line. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

She would like to have been here today, but we live in the sort of time when what seemed entirely straightforward when I first joined this chamber is not straightforward right now. Travel logistics between Perth and Canberra, which were straightforward for a very long time, are anything but, in terms of flight connections and in terms of capacity to re-enter your own state after you've come to a place like Canberra. So, sadly, my amazing wife, who has carried much of the burden for me to be able to do this job over the last 13½ years, is not here today and our two beautiful children, Isabelle and Charlotte, are not here today. That is a bit of a regret as I now start to give what is going to be my final speech in this chamber.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr President, how good is Australia! I know that in more-recent times this sentence has been assumed by somebody more famous than me, but let me say that for as long as I've lived in Australia, from the moment I arrived here in 1996 as a migrant from Belgium, I have often said, 'How good is Australia,' because this is truly a country where, wherever you come from—whatever corner of the world—if you come with the right attitude and with the intention to have a go, work hard and do the best you can in your chosen field of endeavour, there is really and truly no limit to what you can achieve. The proof is in the pudding here in the Senate. We've got a leader of the opposition and a leader of the government who are both first-generation Australians from non-English-speaking backgrounds. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have thoroughly loved my time in the Senate. I love this place. We come here with a whole diversity of perspectives, with different views and with different aspirations, and we represent many, many Australians with different views and aspirations. In this chamber we engage in the battle of ideas, we engage in political combat, and we engage in the personality contest every now and then. But in the end, this is a chamber where, on behalf of the nation, by engaging in the policy debate we are able to achieve a consensus on the best way forward. In that process, I've always been a very enthusiastic participant, both in opposition and in government. I've found it to be more fun in government, I've got to say.</span>

                  </a>  There's probably nobody in this parliament with whom I've sparred more vigorously and engaged more vigorously in the political battle of ideas than Senator Wong, yet we do have a deep personal friendship, which I'm sure she won't mind me saying publicly, and we do trust each other. How good is it to work that way, where you can not give an inch in fighting for what you believe in but also work with each other to find practical and pragmatic solutions where that is in the interests of the nation? Senator Wong, that has always been how we've both approached it, and I very much appreciate that about you. We've been on opposite sides in Senate estimates for many, many years, first from opposition and then from government. I've got to say, I enjoyed that better from government too! I've decided I am more of a batsman than a bowler, and I'm happy that I don't have to go back into a bowling session.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr President, when I came here in 1996 I never thought I'd end up in politics. You can't plan this. I thought I'd go and work in a law firm, in a business, or whatever. I tried to get a job in Perth when I arrived. Back in the mid-nineties, the legal fraternity in Western Australia was still comparatively protectionist in terms of the capacity of law graduates who were from a non-English-speaking background or who were non-Australian-educated to get into the legal profession. It intrigued me when, years later, my wife, Hayley, started working at Clayton Utz—it was in the mid-2000s—and people were bending over backwards to facilitate people through the process as quickly as possible, from wherever they came. Ten years earlier, they'd said I had to go back to university for another two years, after I had done six years of university already. That didn't seem that appealing to me at the time, so I ended up working as a staffer for a politician. That was the only immediately transferable skill I had, where there wasn't any protectionism in place, that I could deploy in the short term.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That was not necessarily all that straightforward initially either. A former senator, Alan Eggleston, in 1996 advertised for an electorate officer. I applied for that job and I didn't even get an interview—which I've reminded him of often since! I thought, 'There's got to be a better way.' So I rang the office of the recently elected Senator Chris Ellison, who'd recently been made the chair of the treaties committee. I thought: 'Oh well, it's the treaties committee. I've done some public international law, and I'm international.' 'Treaties' sounded international, so I thought I'd go and have a meeting with him and see whether I could do some work for him as a volunteer. I think he was a bit intrigued when this guy—I was young, skinny and had black hair back then—with a German accent walked in and offered to work as a volunteer. But he took a chance on me, and the rest, as they say, is history. That is how I ended up in the Australian parliament, as a Belgian migrant, in October 1996—24 years ago. I've essentially, one way or another, been around this place ever since, and it has just been an amazing story, an amazing opportunity to contribute to public service through political service.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We all come here with our own personal political and policy values and perspectives. Some of my colleagues have heard me tell this story before—in fact my Liberal-National colleagues heard me tell this story yesterday—but I think I have to put it on the record here. The thing that really persuaded me to pursue the policy and political values that are pursued by the Liberal and National parties was my experience as a student when I reflected, at the time of the fall of the Berlin Wall, on the reason why a people—who, after the Second World War, started with the same challenges, opportunities, context, climate and geography—divided by different political and policy choices, ended up in such fundamentally different positions when it came to their quality of life, their living standards and the general opportunities for individuals, their families and the communities in which they lived. Really, the choice on the western side of the wall, on the western side of Germany, was a choice to pursue policies that supported individual freedom, free enterprise and reward for effort, encouraging people to stretch themselves, take risks and have a go, and all of that underpinned with a social safety net. They called it the social market economy—die soziale Marktwirtschaft.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the other thing that West Germany did—and that is also something that has always stuck with me—was open themselves up to the world. They engaged in open trade. They committed themselves to international competition. They committed themselves to being an outward-looking, globally focused, open, trading economy. And that is where the economic miracle on the western side of Germany came from—that's where the Wirtschaftswunder came from—whereas, on the eastern side, where you had policy choices in the political system that focused on socialism and equality of outcomes, which ultimately led to a lowest-common-denominator focus, people ended up in comparative poverty.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The wall was built only in 1961. From 1949, they were on different trajectories. By 1961, the wall had to be built to keep people on one side in the system because people didn't want to spontaneously stay there. And then, 28 years later, even the wall wasn't enough to keep people in, because, ultimately, people have a thirst for freedom. And the wall came down.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing that I learned then was the power of the trajectory. Commentators and political opponents at various times have laughed at me when I've talked about the power of the trajectory. But think about this: the people of East Berlin wouldn't have noticed on day one or two or five that they were on a different trajectory to the people of West Berlin, but, when you're on a different trajectory for 40 years and you're making bad choices as opposed to good choices, when you look back after 40 years, the destination you end up in can be fundamentally different. Some people have said, 'Oh well, that's because on one side it was a dictatorship and it was an autocratic political system, and that's why people weren't enjoying the same living standards.' But that fails to understand what is the cause and what is the effect. The reason the system became more and more dictatorial and more and more autocratic was because they had to exercise more and more control on those people who didn't want to spontaneously live in a system that restricted their freedoms.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Fast-forward to Australia: Australia in the 1980s, in the era post the Hawke and Keating governments, then the Howard government and subsequent governments, leading all the way to the Morrison government now—since Australia has made a decision to open ourselves up to the world, to be a globally focused, open, trading economy, we have gone from strength to strength. We've gone through a period of nearly 30 years of continuous growth, on the back of making the difficult decisions, nearly 40 years ago, of opening ourselves up to global competition. Yes, there have been difficult transitions, and of course it wasn't all easy, but it has made Australia stronger and more prosperous, and it has given the Australian people better opportunities to get ahead and to have the best possible living standards.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">International competition can be uncomfortable. This is a debate that is taking place in the world now. There can be a temptation to say, 'Wouldn't it be so much more comfortable if we protect ourselves from global competition and if we put fences around various activities so that people don't have to worry about being challenged?' The problem with that is just by putting a fence around something, just by protecting something, doesn't mean that the innovation and the competitive forces elsewhere stop. All it means is that you lose touch with where the rest of the world is at. All it means is that you fall further behind. So, as we work on getting out of this COVID recession, we've got to make sure, as a nation, that we continue to remember what has made us so strong over 30 years of continuous growth. It has been a genuine commitment—which has been a bipartisan commitment—to Australia as a globally focused, open trading economy. That has been for over 30 years so far, and it will be in the future, the best way for Australia to offer the best possible opportunities for Australians today and into the future to get ahead.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">During my time in this chamber, in opposition and in government, I've been involved in a whole series of policy battles. You win some and you lose some. But I've always been an enthusiastic and vigorous contributor in those various debates and battles. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I guess the other thing I've learned in this place is that sometimes what you are able to stop can be as important as what you are able to put in place. One of the proud moments of my career was to be able to put the detailed and forensic scrutiny over the anti-WA mining tax, which a previous government sought to impose—99 per cent of the revenue of which was going to come out of one jurisdiction. It is a moment of great personal pride that we were able to repeal that particular legislation on coming into government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In coming into parliament, I've always looked at the period in opposition as the training period to prepare you in the best possible way to be able to make a meaningful contribution in government, if and when you get the opportunity to serve in government. In the Senate, I have to say that the Senate estimates process is an amazing way to be trained as a future contributor in executive government, because you get to know all the people, you get to know all the issues and, if you apply yourself to asking all of the possible questions, it is an amazing way to get across a lot of details. It's the ultimate on-the-job university-level training, I would say. So, on coming into government in 2013, and looking back since 2013, I am proud that, as a government, we have been able to repair the budget to the point where by 2018-19—the great budget of 2018-19, hey, Prime Minister!—we had returned the budget back into balance. We had, over the period between 2013 and 2023, prior to the coronavirus crisis hitting us, passed and implemented budget bottom line improvements to the tune of $250 billion. So what that means is the bottom line would have been $250 billion worse off over that period if we hadn't made the decisions and hadn't legislated the decisions that we've put forward in various budgets.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, I've been involved in seven budgets, seven half-yearly budget updates, eight final budget outcomes and a couple of Pre-election Economic and Fiscal Outlooks, and that is a pretty involved process. Every budget, every half-yearly budget update—Simon, you'll find out!—involves a lot of meetings in rooms without windows. It involves a lot of papers to read through. It's a lot of conversations with colleagues. It involves a lot of conversations within the Expenditure Review Committee with a view of trying to make the best possible decisions for the future of Australia. It's a fine balance. You want to make decisions to allocate resources, where that is appropriate, as much as necessary but as little as possible—Simon!—and you want to make sure that the expenditure is effective in achieving the policy objective that you're pursuing as a government. But you also are always very mindful that if you don't get this prioritisation right there are real consequences for real people. In particular this year, 2020, as we were hit with the coronavirus crisis and we had to make so many decisions on things like JobKeeper, JobSeeker and so on, we were very, very conscious of—and it was mentally and emotionally quite a heavy burden to really think through—what this meant for real people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over this period in office the successful legislation of personal income tax cuts in 2018 and 2019 to the value now of $350 billion, putting more money into workers' pockets and helping to stimulate the economy and generate growth by boosting aggregate demand, is one of my personal highlights in terms of legislation going through the Senate during this period. It was quite hotly contested the first two times, but it was comparatively easy today to bring these income tax cuts forward. And there were various savings bills.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the things I want to reflect on—this is something where the coalition and the Greens came together—is Senate voting reform. Before we reformed the Senate voting system there was this lottery where, somehow, 97 per cent of people who voted 1 above the line immediately lost control of their preferences. Those preferences were traded by so-called preference whisperers who were doing deals, behind closed doors, which weren't transparent at all. The reforms that we passed were reforms that empowered voters to determine not only where their first preference would go if they voted above the line but also where their second, third and subsequent preferences would go above the line. So, instead of people getting elected to the Senate with very low numbers of votes, whatever our views on the views of individual senators represented in this chamber now, the people who are here are here because a sufficient number of Australians backed them in. They are here because they reflect the views and aspirations of a sufficient number of Australians, not because of some accidental lottery based on a backroom deal.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There was 40 hours of debate—including one debate through the night; I think we started on a Thursday afternoon at 4.30 or five o'clock and we went straight through to two o'clock the next afternoon—and the Labor Party was running a roster against me! Every hour, I think, we had quorum calls and motions to suspend the Senate, and everybody turned up. This is where I've got to say: what a fantastic team I've had the privilege to work with here in the Senate. We've been involved in many battles for the nation, and we've won many good battles for the nation that will put Australia on a stronger foundation and trajectory for the future for some time to come.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm proud of my work—which is perhaps not as well known, but Senator Wong knows about it—with the Australia-Germany Advisory Group. One of the jobs I was given by then Prime Minister Abbott in 2014 at the G20 Leaders' Summit, when we had a bilateral meeting with Chancellor Merkel, was to co-chair the Australia-Germany Advisory Group to explore ways to broaden, deepen and strengthen the bilateral relationship with Germany. Germany is the biggest economic power in Europe and the fourth-biggest economic power in the world. We had friendly relations, but we weren't really top of mind with each other; it was a very long distance away. Germany is a very important economy in Europe, and Europe is a very important economy—perhaps one that historically we accessed primarily through the United Kingdom, because of obvious historical ties. The work that we did to strengthen our relationship with Germany—and with France, and with other countries on the continent—will stand us in good stead moving forward as we now pursue a trade agreement separately with the European Union and with the United Kingdom post the Brexit vote in the UK.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm mindful of time, and I don't want to hold everybody up for too long, but quickly: at a WA level, other than being able to get rid of the mining tax, there was GST reform and the reform of GST-sharing arrangements—making sure that we delivered a fairer, better deal for Western Australia—in a way that was good for the country and which encouraged and facilitated stronger national growth. It was also good for every other state, because we calibrated the arrangements such that no other state was worse off. In fact, all states were better off. That is a real credit to Scott Morrison as Treasurer. He worked with his Liberal colleagues from WA; he worked really hard and really smart to come up with a creative way of delivering the outcome, and the people of Western Australia will be forever grateful for the work you did there, Prime Minister.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Western Australian state government and my good friend, the Treasurer of Western Australia, Ben Wyatt, delivered his budget in Western Australia yesterday. He delivered a $1.2 billion surplus—not bad in a pandemic, I guess! But do you know how much the GST top-up payment is as a result of our reforms this financial year? It's $1.5 billion. A $1.2 billion surplus and a $1.5 billion GST top-up payment, courtesy of the Morrison reforms to the GST-sharing arrangements, put it very starkly, I thought. And, with my colleagues, I've also been proud to have been able to help deliver a fair share in federal infrastructure funding for the great state of Western Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to turn now to the marriage law postal survey for a moment, if you don't mind. For the entire period that I've been in this parliament, the issue of marriage equality kept popping back up and it was never resolved. It became increasingly divisive in the community and there was clearly a very strong push to resolve this issue and to get it dealt with once and for all. Across the Australian community there was, among good and reasonable Australians, a diversity of views which was not easily reconcilable. Good Australians can legitimately have a different perspective on this and we needed to find a way to resolve this issue once and for all for the nation in a way that kept the nation together.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know there was a big push that this should just be dealt with by a vote in parliament without consulting the Australian people. Let me tell you, I am proud of the role I was able to play to facilitate the effective, professional conduct of the Australian marriage law postal survey through the ABS, which did an outstanding job in helping to deliver it. The result was there for all to see and the result, I believe, helped to achieve that reform in a way that had overwhelming public support. If the parliament had imposed this on the Australian people there would always have been one side of the community that would have resented that change having been imposed. Having made that decision in the way we did the reform was achieved, but in a way that kept the nation together.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr President, this has been an amazing opportunity to serve my country—the country that I chose to make my home. All of us come here with the support of a whole range of different people but, fundamentally, our parties and the people who vote for us at elections. I would like to thank the Western Australian Liberal Party for the trust they put in me, a non-English-speaking-background migrant who had been in the country for fewer than 11 years at the time. I promised that I would give it my best. I hope that you will agree that I have.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I got here, I was here at the tail end of the Howard government. I just thought: 'Wow, this is just amazing. How did I end up in this party room with John Howard?' He was an absolute giant and somebody who I admired deeply. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But then we went through a period in opposition with Brendan Nelson—a fine Australian, a great Australian—and Malcolm Turnbull, with whom I had a very good personal and working relationship. Much has been written, but I think the Prime Minister would agree and my friend Peter Dutton would agree that during the period of his leadership we all worked very hard to help make him the most successful Prime Minister he could possibly be, and a lot of good things were achieved during that period.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tony Abbott, who nearly won the election for us in 2010, worked so hard, who did win the election in 2013—obviously, a man of strong convictions—and who first put me into the cabinet. I will forever be grateful for the opportunities that he gave me.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Scott Morrison—Scott and I are very close friends. We have worked together exceptionally well. So don't believe all of the stuff that you read in the media. We are very, very good friends. Yes, we engage in debates on policy, and we don't always agree. Newsflash: in politics you look at issues and you have ideas on the best way forward and how to resolve things, with the overlay of your political values, and from time to time you have different perspectives. The debate that you engage in brings you to a better way forward. That is actually the way this system is meant to work. That is the way the Expenditure Review Committee is meant to work and the cabinet is meant to work. The reason cabinet discussions are confidential is so that you can openly and robustly engage in this sort of debate, because that is how you end up with the best possible decisions for your country. It is true that Scott and I, on occasions, have had robust conversations on policy, but we've always been close and trusted friends in this endeavour as we seek to achieve the best outcomes for our nation. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me say that as I leave this place I feel comfortable in the knowledge that Scott Morrison is leading a strong, united and cohesive team—the strongest, most united and most cohesive team that I've been a part of since I've been in this parliament on our side of politics. As I become citizen Cormann, Prime Minister, I wish you and your government all the very best into the future.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to thank Bridget—Senator McKenzie—as Leader of the Nationals. Again, we are two different parties and from time to time we have different perspectives on different issues, but we've always worked together exceptionally well and with the right overall attitude and commitment to finding solutions. I really thank you very much for the way that you have engaged with me. In fact, I would like to thank all of my Liberal-National colleagues for having supported me through my endeavours.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to thank every senator in this chamber. I have thoroughly enjoyed engaging with all of you and I thoroughly respect and value the work you do for our nation. It is your job to go hard for what you believe in. It is your job to engage in the debates that you engage in, and I know that you will continue to do so. Let me just say, Penny, I do hope that we'll stay in touch, even after we've left this place.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">As for the crossbench, there's been a great diversity of people on the crossbench over the years, like Steve Fielding, Nick Xenophon, Glenn Lazarus, Senator Lambie, Senator Griff, Senator Roberts, Senator Hanson, Senator Burston and Senator Georgiou and, of course, all of our good friends in the Greens over the years: Senator Bob Brown, who was the Greens leader when I got here; Senator Milne; Senator Di Natale; and now, of course, Senator Waters. I have always sought to find a way to find common ground even when that initially appeared somewhat impossible. Senator Patrick knows how persistent I can be in trying to find common ground! I really thank all of you—Senator Leyonhjelm, Senator Day. There's been quite a long list of different crossbench perspectives over the years, but it's been such a privilege to work with every single one of you. I will be watching you from a distance and wishing you all the very best.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have been blessed with the great staff that I've had during my time in office. Senator Slade Brockman was my chief of staff for most of my period in opposition. We've done some great things together—and here he is in this chamber. He's now making his own contribution in his own right. He is doing a magnificent job—in particular, across regional Western Australia. I've had three chiefs of staff while in government. Simon Atkinson, who has gone on to better and higher things, made an outstanding contribution in my office during my first three years as finance minister. He's an exceptional public servant, and I'm sure that he has much further to go under governments of either persuasion. I wish you very well. Belinda Pola, an outstanding professional, decided to go back to Queensland to have a family. She made a great contribution in my office for quite some time. And Chris Browne, who I think is here somewhere—up the back, yes—has held the fort for some time now. He doesn't know this, but I picked him as a future staffer when I first saw him at a Young Liberals function in 2008. I thought, 'This guy is talented!' In 2015 there was an opportunity and I snatched him, and he has done an excellent job in my office.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's hard, because I don't want to go through a whole shopping list of names, so I hope that my other very hardworking staff members will forgive me for just limiting it to a few. Natasha Lobo, my EA in Perth, has worked with me—I first hired her in 1997, and she has been with me in my WA Senate office for the entire period. She's just an amazing support and has been amazingly loyal over so many years. Karen Wu, who has worked for seven years as the senior media adviser in government—that's a tough job. Thank you very much for your service over that time. Philippa Campbell came to me after a long period in Peter Costello's office, so she knew a lot of what I needed to know when I started in this job. She has been an amazing support.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I had the privilege of being the minister for the best department in the Commonwealth. Prime Minister, Finance is the best department in the Commonwealth. Simon, Finance is the best department in the Commonwealth. You're close enough to the centre without being right at the centre. You're close enough to be able to help shape the decisions and the policy directions without being entirely on the frontline and you've got a group of professionals in the department that are just outstanding. As for the secretaries in my department, David Tune was there to settle me in when I arrived—I did know him from the estimates period. He was very generous to me and was, I guess, initially teaching me the ropes as a new minister. The formidable Jane Halton deployed all of her energy and passion to taking me to another level. Rosemary Huxtable is just an amazing, world-class public servant. It has been such a privilege to work with you over the entire period. Rosemary was the deputy secretary of budget in Finance when I arrived, and we did our first few budgets from that position. In more recent years, she has become the secretary of the department. Rosemary, I really value the work that we've been able to do together to help give our nation the best possible foundation and put it on the best possible trajectory for the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also like to thank the clerks, who, when we were in opposition in particular, were so helpful in boosting my training to give the government of the day at the time the hardest possible time. Because of all of the tricks that I learnt from the clerks when in opposition, I knew how to defend myself against the opposition when we were in government—not always but perhaps a bit better than I otherwise might have—which was fantastic. The chamber attendants here are always unfailingly courteous. This has been just such a great workplace. Everybody just makes it tick in such a nice and friendly and courteous fashion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to finish by firstly thanking my parents for the opportunity they gave me as a child growing up. I'm not your typical Liberal-background politician. My parents are working class. My mum was a full-time mum. My dad was a factory worker. He got sick; he ended up on a disability pension. They had four kids by the time they were 28. It wasn't plain sailing, but they bent over backwards to give me the best possible opportunity, and for that I will forever be grateful.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to finish by saying a very sincere thank you to Hayley. Hayley is an outstanding woman. She's an amazing individual. She's obviously my life's partner and best friend. She's an amazing mother to our beautiful children, Isabelle and Charlotte, but she's an outstanding professional woman with a distinguished career in her own right. She was the President of the Law Society in WA at age 35. I'm so proud of what Hayley has achieved now working at the bar in Perth and to observe the respect in which she's held by her colleagues and her peers in that profession. Hayley had to build her career throughout that entire period while I was mostly away. During the seven years as finance minister, I was essentially over east every week from the middle of January to the middle of December—every week. We have two kids. Hayley had her own career. I was over here. So she has carried a very substantial burden for me being able to pursue this opportunity to do this job, and I will forever be grateful for that. Thank you very much, Hayley.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, colleagues, this is my last contribution from this chair in this chamber. There is probably more that I could or should have said, but I think the hour is advancing. I give you this commitment: after today, I won't be back!</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="00AOU" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WONG</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:02</span>):  I rise on this, the valedictory of my friend and colleague Mathias Cormann, and I wish to say a few words personally but also on behalf of the Labor Party as he leaves this chamber. When Mathias announced his intention to resign, I put out a statement in which I said he was:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… a formidable opponent &amp; a trusted counterpart: a parliamentarian of the old school.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I'm going to go through those briefly. First, we'll start with 'formidable opponent'. When I was a minister—I'm not from WA, so I didn't engage with him on the plane et cetera—the first thing I remember about Mathias—I was kind of engaged in climate policy, which was not the easiest ministerial job to start with—was this bloke with a German accent who kept asking me questions and then started following me around at estimates, not in a stalking sense but in turning up to estimates. I thought, 'Who is this bloke?' Anyway, we did have quite a lot of interchanges at estimates. He subsequently said to me, when he became a minister and he wasn't answering questions, that he'd learnt a lot about how not to really answer the questions from me when I was a minister, but I think that is a vicious, vicious calumny—definitely untrue!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our combat has been pretty hard at times. I think it's generally not been personal or churlish. He did once try calling me 'Australia's worst finance minister'. I pointed out to him that my net debt was lower, my gross debt was lower and my tax-to-GDP ratio was lower, and he didn't keep going with it, although he keeps going occasionally with the same sort of exaggerated position that the coalition had to put in place to justify the 2014 budget. But, notwithstanding the results of this budget, I'm not going to return the favour of the moniker. I don't think that's a practice we should continue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I didn't know Mathias well when we were in government and he was in opposition, but I do remember one rather untoward event at estimates where I realised he must be a reasonably decent man. I don't wish to embarrass the particular other senator, but I got meowed at in estimates, and it got quite a bit of media. The bloke subsequently apologised, and we all moved on. But I remember Mathias sitting there, almost with his hand in his mouth, not saying anything. I thought, 'Well, maybe this bloke is actually decent.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I described him as a trusted counterpart. He is. He's a decent man and he's an honourable man. I'm sure he would be the first to say he's made mistakes at times. But I don't think, between us, we have ever breached a confidence. We have always sought to honour our commitments to each other. I have valued that greatly. There are not many people about whom you can say that in politics. It has been something I have valued greatly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also described him as a parliamentarian of the old school. I just want to talk briefly about what I meant when I said that. The first—and we saw it again today in his contribution, although I noticed he didn't acknowledge the Social Democratic Party of Germany, our sister party, in his contribution about the wall, but leaving that aside—is that he has a belief in democracy. A belief in democracy is more than just words; it's a respect for institutions. It demands a respect for norms and conventions, a respect for this parliament. Mathias brings that to his job. Sometimes I think, as I said yesterday, that he should have answered more questions, but he does understand that, as much as our Constitution and our history, our democracy depends on what we do here and how we behave here.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think one thing we share is a belief in the importance of containing conflict. Now, that might sound to those opposite a little odd, coming from Penny Wong, but it's actually so important. Politics is, as some have said, war by other means. It's what we do to resolve conflict. We don't have revolutions, we don't get out guns, we don't become vigilantes. We fight here. There must be limits, there must be containment, because conflict without any limit risks destroying too much. It risks damaging the polity, the people, the community, the institution, too much. That is one thing I think Mathias and I have shared—an understanding of what we wanted to fight about and what we wanted to make sure we didn't fight about. Some of those limits are set by our democratic traditions, by our democratic system, by norms and conventions. Some of them should be set by decency—things like the limitations around personal attacks and an understanding that disengagement is sometimes required and, on some issues, that we shouldn't be partisan.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are many examples I could give of times where, regardless of our very different views on some issues, we would have conversations which were about: 'We need to make sure there's bipartisanship on this. We need to make sure there's limited conflict on this.' One of them that I remember—because it meant a lot to me, because of my history and my experience of racism when I was young—was after the Fraser Anning comments. People might recall we had a bipartisan motion. I remember ringing Mathias from out the back, next to the kids' trampoline, and I said: 'It would be really good if we could move this motion together. It would say something. There's a lot of conflict, and people can do a lot of politics about it, but people need to hear a defence of multiculturalism and the assertion of inclusion from us both.' It's not the only thing we've worked on together. Some of the things I'm honour-bound to keep between us! But it was important. You heard Senator Cormann start today with a discussion about us both having a migrant background—him much later in life, obviously. I think that has informed some of what we understand to be outside of the zone of desirable conflict in a democracy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will miss our contest. I'll miss our catch-ups and the very good red wine. I'll miss our friendship—although I, too, hope we maintain it beyond this. I'll miss sharing photos and stories of our children across the table during question time. I want to acknowledge your contribution to the nation and to the parliament. I wish more of it had been in opposition! I want to thank Hayley for her contribution to the nation, and I want to say: I reckon he's been pretty lucky and he's got a lot better with your influence. To Isabelle and Charlotte: it's wonderful you get to have your father back, in a different way. So, Mathias, I wish you well, personally, for all that lies beyond, and I thank you for your friendship and for your contribution.</span>

Mathias Cormann. More than 12 years ago, when I entered this place, I took up my place beside you as a fellow senator for the great state of Western Australia. Now I stand here today contributing to your valedictory, and I can genuinely say that, over the years in this place, you have been a true friend. I thank you for both your friendship and your steadfast representation of the values that you and I hold so dear.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mathias, in your more than 13 years in this place, you have left a mark that few others will ever emulate. Your achievements in this place and your service to our nation's wellbeing will have an impact for decades to come. Your legacy will be enduring. Colleagues, in Mathias's maiden speech in 2007, he said this:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">… this is a country where, if you put your shoulder to the wheel, work hard, embrace the people and values and become an integral part of the community—in short, if you have a go—there is no limit to what you can achieve in your chosen field of endeavour. We all come to this place with a commitment to make a positive difference. Other than our energy and our enthusiasm, we bring to the table our background, our experiences and our values.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mathias, yours is, without a doubt, a great Australian story and one that should inspire anyone, from any background, who wants to succeed. You came here as an immigrant in your 20s and you embraced your new home. You've made a valuable contribution to our country through an incredible amount of hard work, 25 hours a day, eight days a week. That's just how you work. But it is this commitment and determination—and I think my colleagues will agree, no matter how frustrating it is for the rest of us when we receive a text from you at midnight on a Sunday and you expect a timely response!—that has seen you succeed in everything you do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the last few months, as our nation has faced the challenges of the COVID-19 pandemic, you as the Minister for Finance, as part of the team, knew what needed to be done to provide the support to drive the economic recovery. As the Prime Minister himself has stated, your work as our finance minister for seven years saw our nation enter COVID-19 in a far stronger position than it otherwise would have been. It therefore allowed us to bring forward initiatives such as the JobKeeper payment, the JobKeeper supplement, the 'supporting apprentices and trainees' initiative and the many, many other initiatives which will help our economic recovery.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For me, it is a personally bittersweet moment that you are leaving this place. I am so pleased for your new opportunity as Australia's candidate for Secretary-General of the OECD. You will make, if elected, an incredibly valuable contribution to promoting not only growth but also opportunity across the globe. As fellow Western Australian Liberal senators, we have been a united team since that meeting back in 2006. It was 7 am and we met at the then famous Bar One on St Georges Terrace in Perth for breakfast and, as Mathias liked to call it, 'a chat'. That chat, though, ultimately changed the course of both our lives, and here we are in 2020. I can honestly say that supporting you in your preselection was one of the best decisions I've ever made, and we've had each other's back ever since. In fact, colleagues, as many of you will know, every year since I was elected Mathias and I have held the Cormann-Cash annual state council Christmas function. This year we'll hold our 13th and final function, and boy will it be a big night!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mathias, your achievements in this place are extensive. You have been an effective senator, passionately representing the interests of our great state. You may not have been born in Western Australia but you are, without a doubt, a sandgroper through and through. It was your leadership of our WA team and your constant advocacy that ensured Western Australia did get a fair deal, and now gets a fair deal when it comes to GST distribution. All of the WA team, many of whom have joined us here today, were proud to stand and fight with you. For many years to come this is something that our great state will not forget, and it will continue to have a positive impact in Western Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In your leadership roles, you have well and truly mastered this place—as Senator Wong herself acknowledged—whether it was working behind the scenes with colleagues within the government or reaching out and working with the opposition, the crossbench and the Australian Greens. When it comes to your role as finance minister, there is no question that you have consistently followed the principles you laid out in your maiden speech: free enterprise, individual freedom, personal responsibility, reward for effort, low taxation, less regulation and incentives for people to stretch themselves and to reach their full potential. The reason you are so successful is your incredible work ethic and the fact that—again, as Senator Wong, herself articulated—you treat all senators, regardless of their political affiliation, with respect.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In your maiden speech to this place you also said, 'Politics at its best is a noble profession. It is a noble pursuit.' In your case, history will record that you have carried yourself with great nobility. As we all know, it is often said that one of the greatest achievements in politics is to leave at a time of your choosing and on your own terms, and, my friend, you are doing exactly that. You leave this place with an outstanding record of service and achievement to undertake a new opportunity to serve both our nation and the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mathias, we will all miss your contribution in this place, and I will certainly miss you as a colleague and a friend. I wish you all the best in your next chapter but in particular, as Senator Wong said, with Hayley, Charlotte and Isabelle. I conclude by saying: farewell, good and faithful servant of Western Australia and, indeed, Australia generally. Mathias, my friend, thank you.</span>

                  <a href="207825" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McKENZIE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Nationals in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:18</span>):  I rise as Leader of The Nationals in the Senate and join everybody here. The fact that it's a valedictory and we've still got the stands packed I think is a testament to the man whose valedictory we're participating in today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You are so patriotic, Mathias, for your adopted nation. You're a senator's senator, and we want to make sure there are more of those around. Your contribution to the parliament, to the coalition and to our nation has been significant, and I'm looking forward to it continuing in another role.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You've been Leader of the Government in the Senate since 2017, and it was my great honour, as Deputy Leader of the Nationals, to sit in that leadership group heading into the 2019 election and, again, to work with you post the election as the Leader of the Nationals. I think it's your integrity, your trust and your value system—and your sense of humour, at times, and your patience, too—that really meant that we could get the results that we needed to.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Former Nationals leaders Warren Truss and Barnaby Joyce and the current DPM, Michael McCormack, have all spoken highly about working with you in their former and current roles, as has Nigel Scullion, another Senate leader and Nashie you've worked with. I spoke to Warren Truss, the former Deputy Prime Minister, earlier today, and he was unequivocal: he believes you're the most outstanding finance minister we've seen. It's your attention to detail, the fact that you're across your brief and that you approach negotiations rationally, calmly and reasonably. 'You don't always win, with Mathias,' he said, 'but you know you've had a fair hearing.' So thank you for the work that you do in that way.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Whether negotiating the fuel excise or championing our live export and mining sectors, the National Party and Senator Cormann saw eye to eye on many, many issues. I think it's his rock-solid commitment as a true coalitionist—you can't say that about everybody in the Liberal Party, but Mathias Cormann is a true coalitionist, because he understands that together the Liberal Party and the National Party provide strong, stable government for our nation, and that's the best outcome in the national interest. The mining sector that you championed for WA wasn't just for WA, and the Nationals want to thank you for your attention to that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's sage advice to always pay attention to the smartest guy in the room. He can be your friend and supporter—or not! I think it's always best to do that, and you always display a commitment to try to be the former. You have an unwavering commitment to bettering the lives of all Australians, and I think you spoke earlier about your upbringing and what role that played in the value system and world view you brought to this place. I think we're all the richer for hearing that here. You have been a rock-like figure for the coalition ever since you came to parliament and we're going to miss you severely.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We mentioned estimates briefly; what I love about watching Mathias in estimates—and, again, it's like being schooled—is that he has an army of public servants, every seat behind him is taken up, and Rosemary is there; she has all the folders, but he takes every question. And he can answer them; he's across the detail, and that is exactly how this process is meant to work. It's an incredible privilege to watch you on FPA.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are from generation X, and I do want to share that in some of those late-night sittings we had some good tunes with former Senator Fifield, Cashie and Parry. It was all good fun, but I think, Mathias, that what you have brought here has provided, in my experience, some of the great moments of this chamber, and Senator Wong mentioned one earlier. There is the ability of both of you to come together in really key and significant moments, such as on the issue of racism. That was one of the most powerful moments that I think this chamber has ever seen and it was a great privilege to be able to sit here and see both of you. I'm proud of our nation for sending you both and then proud of you both as individuals for giving us, as senators, that moment in our nation. Yes, you have shown us what this chamber is capable of through that. I think, Mathias, that your commitment to the traditions and values of this chamber is as a senator's senator and that you have a partner in the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate who has helped you to fulfil that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm nearly finished, but I'm just going to recite a poem which I think may describe Mathias's approach to politics.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">He is a coalitionist to the core, and that requires true respect and mutual appreciation that there are two independent parties here. Mathias, that is the key to your success in that role. I look forward to working with Birmo to that end.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is also your pragmatic and rational approach to policy decisions. When you stood as a fresh-faced newcomer in August 2007 and made your first speech you thanked then President Ferguson, from South Australia, for his advice and wisdom. I'll lift a few lines from that young Western Australian senator: 'Thank you for the advice and wisdom you have shared with me in the time we've sat in this chamber. I have very much appreciated the generosity towards me as a new senator'—and me as a leader. In more recent times I have been sincerely grateful to have had the privilege to work alongside you. I've always admired your passion and commitment to our Liberal and National parties coalition. I respect your directness in standing up for what you believe in and bringing those values here as a conviction politician.</span>

You're also praised for being a strong negotiator, but sometimes we don't like the outcomes that you negotiate. Our chamber will certainly miss someone so erudite that they can respond in multiple languages at the drop of a hat, as you did yesterday. I must say that I won't miss you rejecting the premise of my questions, but I do respect your conviction and your work ethic.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="H6X" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BIRMINGHAM</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:27</span>):  In adding to the many fine words said about our friend and colleague Senator Mathias Cormann, I want to focus on just a few brief points. Mathias, you leave here with a number of attributes that very few people carry in this place at the very end of their time of service. You leave with respect and admiration, as we are hearing from friend and foe alike in the political context. That is testament to the way in which you have engaged, as we have heard from so many.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You leave also with achievement and legacy. You have not just served time in this place; you have achieved outcomes. For those outcomes you can leave with a sense of pride. Your family can have pride that the sacrifice has been worthy. Our government, our side of politics, and the nation should give thanks for what you have achieved in that time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You have also demonstrated drive to the final moment of your service in this chamber. You are not one who has put his feet up towards the end. As anyone who has been in receipt of text messages this week knows and anyone who was involved in the preparation of the budget this week knows, you have been there driving relentlessly, and ruthlessly where necessary, right through.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We arrived in this chamber just a few weeks apart, as senators filling casual vacancies in the final few months of the Howard government. We have lived many ups and downs during that time. It is wonderful to stand here at a high point for our government but a most challenging point for the nation as you move into the next phase of your life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think back to our journey through the days in opposition when, yes, there were times when we would tag-team speaking along with a number of others, much to Senator Wong and others' consternation, for sometimes many hours on end. We would rail against the ruthless exercise of the guillotine by Senator Wong and other Labor ministers at the time. But, as Senator Cormann reflected, we learnt a few lessons along the way about when and how to do so. We moved into government, you straight into the cabinet as the finance minister for the whole duration of our time in government. That is a remarkable achievement by you and will be deeply felt by the government in terms of you leaving that role and that loss of continuity. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I, in many roles, have fronted up to the ERC to be bounced out with a Mathias Cormann 'no, go back and sharpen up the pencil for something that comes at lower cost'. Again, just as we learnt some tactics from Senator Wong in opposition, colleagues, hopefully, I've learnt some tactics from Senator Cormann to take into those ERC conversations. </span>

                  </a>  I hope so too!</span>
              </p>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator BIRMINGHAM:</span>
                  </a>  Rosemary, I know you hope that I have too! In a leadership context, you have managed not only to negotiate the coalition, each of our parties with our points of difference at times, and to show respect to those points of difference but also, hopefully, to bring us to points of unity. It is on that front that I hope we can all continue to work together in the same vein. Both you and Senator Wong have spoken some fine words about how this chamber—this parliament, this place—best works. It's not to say that we aren't a robust democracy; we must be a robust democracy—that is absolutely how it best work—but it is also the case that we should all be mindful of the way in which we engage in that robust activity. I think you have both brought out the best in the debate today in doing so. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I add my thanks to Hayley and my best wishes to Hayley, Charlotte and Isabelle in terms of the future ahead. I, of course, am not hoping that they have quite as much of your time and your freedom as some have reflected, because I hope from the perspective of the portfolio that I currently hold that we enjoy the success of your candidacy for the Secretary-General of the OECD and that that leads to a new but equally busy life. It will be a different life, but one where you will make different contributions while still bringing, though, the same drive and values that help not just our country and our economy but countries and economies across the globe to succeed in the future. You're the right man for that job. You've been the right man for the jobs in which you have served in this place and, for that, we thank you. </span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator PATRICK</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:32</span>):  Senator Cormann, I will be one of the many who are very sad to see you go. I think you're a huge loss to the government. You played the role not just of Leader of the Government in the Senate and finance minister but also of the crossbench whisperer. It's from that perspective I'm going to talk briefly about my experiences with you. My experience with you started actually not as a senator but as an adviser to Nick Xenophon. I was involved in a negotiation on paragraph 4.7 of the Commonwealth Procurement Rules. When I first walked into your office, even as a staffer, you were very respectful of me and we've heard that word being used a lot throughout the speeches today. On my first day as a senator I thought, 'I'm going to take this bloke on.' For the final supplementary question to my first question without notice, I said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Minister, you are the crossbench whisperer: the deal maker. What effect do you think this breach of agreement with NXT will have on future crossbench negotiations?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You can see how he's responding there, and I will eventually come back to that, but that's the point at which I worked out what Mathias's greatest weakness was but also his greatest strength, and that was he cares about relationships. In my view that has been his success in this place, because he has maintained relationships with everyone.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In your role as the crossbench whisperer, we haven't always agreed. There have been times when you've annoyed me, there have been times when I've annoyed you, and there have been times when I've really annoyed you. But it's fair to say that always, always, you were professional. We've always had a very professional relationship.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the things that have impressed me most about you—and I'm a crossbencher who has to deal with lots and lots of bits of legislation as well as all of the other tasks—is that you are always across your brief. You are very impressive in that regard. When we negotiate, you've always been respectful. Things that were done in confidence were always held confidential, even at the point of disagreeing about things. I could always trust you, and I could always trust you in delivering. You were always available. Senator Cash talked about a 12-midnight text. I remember one time having a meeting with Senator Cormann in Melbourne—actually, it was a dinner meeting. We had a dinner meeting to resolve an issue to do with shipbuilding, and I won't say much more than this; in 30 years time maybe someone will write about it. We had a dinner. I went back to my cheap hotel—he was staying in a more expensive hotel—and at 4 am I woke up and thought, 'Maybe I've got a solution to this.' I sent him a text saying, 'Are you awake?' and he came back—of course he was awake. I said, 'If you can organise coffee in your hotel, I'll be there at 5 am,' and we met and resolved something, and perhaps in many years time we can talk about that. It was a good outcome for Australia, I might add. The only time you really came close to breaching my trust was the time you poached my senior advisor, Jono, who's probably still around there. He's up in the gallery.</span>

                  </a>  He is a great man. The funny thing was that I knew that he was going to go to a better position from a career perspective, but I sent you a text, and it went something along the lines, 'Do you realise that Jono is the only one in my office that keeps me rational?' Very quickly, because he's always worried about relationships, he called me up and he said, 'Rex, I said to Jono that he couldn't come if you didn't approve.' Of course I approved, because it was a career advancement for Jono. But, again, that showed his sensitivity to the relationships. I know Jono has served you well, and, with some help with a letter to the Prime Minister, I'm happy to take him back!</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I just want to go back to what I said, and I'd like to withdraw some of the harsh remarks that I made in that first question on notice, because actually, just recently, on clause 4.7, you did issue a guidance note which makes me much, much happier. So I think you've actually finally fulfilled everything you committed to. So I withdraw those remarks I made.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The OECD could do with a bloke like you. That's my advice. They could come off with much worse candidates than Mathias Cormann. As I said to you at the start, I'm sad to see you go, but can I just say: you'll never completely leave here because, as the transparency extremist that I am, I am going to, on a regular basis, use the 2009 Cormann motion. Others might not necessarily know what that means, but that is a fantastic motion, and I thank you for it. Mathias Cormann, good luck.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our nation does owe you, as has been articulated here, such a great thanks for the work that you have done, particularly in that relentless focus on trajectory during the seven last budgets. There is no time more than now when that has been so necessary.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to, as I said, take my opportunity to share a few reflections on Mathias in a little more of a personal sense. Mathias and I first got to know each other and work together in 2001 in the office of Senator Chris Ellison, where I was his chief of staff at the time. Chris was a wonderful mentor, as Mathias has said. We had a great office at the time. There was Mathias, Dean Smith, Christian Porter and many others. All of us do owe Chris a great debt of gratitude for that experience.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On reflection, I think there were a couple of things in that time that contributed to Mathias being the man and the minister he has been. That time in that office with Chris Ellison in 2001 and 2003, when I was there, shaped not only me but all of us in that office, going through the Bali bombings, September 11 and the issue with the boat arrivals and the deaths. We saw the best of humanity and we also saw the absolute worst of humanity. I know it shaped me in so many ways, as I'm sure it's contributed to making Mathias who he is, with his respect for human dignity and equality before the law and also in understanding the need in this job for great compassion and also great strength, particularly in national security.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the last 18 months, being on the National Security Committee of cabinet, I saw Mathias's very steady hand and wise guidance on that committee, dealing with significant issues of national security, COVID-19 and the bushfire season. Mathias, given the nature of those deliberations and noting there's only a small handful of us who would ever see it, your contribution to our nation's security cannot be underestimated.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is something I want to share with you that has given me some insights into Mathias. Back in 2011 Chris Ellison brought the team together. I think Mathias came to see us as a second family. Over the last nearly 20 years, no matter how busy Mathias has been, he has done everything he can to keep that family together. Every year, no matter how busy, he brings all the past people who have worked for Chris Ellison together. As Mathias's family has grown, Chris Ellison's family has continued to be part of Mathias's family. There is no-one who barbecues Belgian sausages better than Mathias Cormann. There's also nobody who bakes a more impressive birthday cake than Mathias.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, Mathias, thank you for keeping that team together, and thank you for including us in your family's lives and giving us firsthand insight into some of the stressors and strains that Hayley and the girls have worn in your service. I say to our Defence families that their families serve alongside them in service of our nation, and your family has certainly served alongside you and made your contributions to our nation possible.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Like everybody else, I wish you all the best for the next phase of your career. I absolutely hope—I know you would make an outstanding Secretary-General to the OECD. I can tell you that the Ellison family would be more than happy to come to you for the next Christmas in Europe. In reference to cricket, I think you are possibly the finest Belgian batter and bowler that our nation has ever had. Good luck, and thank you for everything you've done for all of us.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator GALLAGHER:</span>
                  </a>  Yes, I think that sounds pretty reasonable. On one of your most significant strengths, as many others have spoken about this morning: in politics a lot of people undervalue relationships, and it's been obvious to me, since I've come into the Senate, that that's something you've never done. You're able to build relationships across the chamber; I think the number of people in here and talking today shows how much people have valued that over time. I think that is underrated in politics. Politics at its heart is a very honourable profession—some of us are closer to that than others, perhaps! But serving the country, serving in the public way, is an honourable profession, and we need people who aspire to that and I think you have aspired to that in politics. Even though I disagree deeply with you on many aspects of politics itself, I do think that that's important and I think you've shown that it matters. As a leader, that matters because it permeates across the chamber. Senate relationships matter more than those in most chambers in minority parliaments. Without a leader that values them, this would be a much messier place than at other times.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I found you a rather frustrating opponent. When I try and put my finger on why, I think it is because you're very capable.</span>

                  </a>  A less capable opponent would have been more welcome! I went into estimates when I came to this place from government and came into opposition, and I thought I'd be really good at estimates. People use the cricket analogy—Senator Reynolds just did, and I think you might have as well. I would describe you as a handy all-rounder, really. At estimates I would try everything; I'd try to antagonise you, verbalise you, irritate you, go around you, go to the back of the budget books, go to the front of the budget books, just to find a way to penetrate what I saw as an immovable object in my way. But you've taught me a lot through that. You learnt from Penny and I've learned from you, so, when I'm finance minister, beware; I'm going to be fabulous! In terms of next estimates—and I said this to you before—please feel free to not attend. That's fine; leave approved!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On a personal note, I know that you and Penny have a very strong personal friendship; I saw a glimpse of that, working in the role I have. But I, too, have enjoyed some of the WhatsApp messages—the ambit, where they start and where we get to in the end. It would be an interesting trail if that confidence were ever to be betrayed—which it won't be! On a personal level, in my constitutional interlude, as I reflect on it, you were very kind to me—it was a difficult time—and I appreciate that very much.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of the transition out, as someone who has left government and left being in the role where you make decisions and make things happen, it isn't as easy as you'd like to think. You think of all this quiet time and time with the family, which is all very lovely, but there's also a part of you that has to adjust to a role where you don't just pick up the phone and order a range of people to do certain things or where you're able to see a problem and fix it. I think Senator Keneally has experienced this; we all have, as we transition out of different roles. The caravan moves on very quickly. I think part of transitioning out is being kind to yourself and acknowledging that. Life is a funny thing. There are always other opportunities. I know life post politics will be very good for you. I hope that you get the time with your family that you need in the interim. I think the other thing capable people do is sign themselves up for so many things afterwards that they don't find that right balance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've enjoyed working with you, Mathias. I'm not going to miss you at estimates. I remember once moaning through estimates that we didn't get all your media releases and was there a reason why and some conspiracy why we were left off your email list. We'd tried to sign up. You assured me there was no issue and you'd go away and look at it and I've regretted it ever since because I get everything about four times! They really listen to you! They've signed me up and now I'm just, 'What has Mathias been up to?' Some days you're very busy. But all the best. I wish you and your family very well.</span>

The answer is, as I'm sure we all know, that he is very, very good. There are so many things we could stand here and bear testament to as to why he is so good, but I thought I'd share a couple of reasons why I think Mathias Cormann is so good. He has the most extraordinary skills at herding cats. As we know on our side, we have a very broad church and he has to keep all of us in the corral at the same time as he's trying to round up the crossbench. All the while he still seems to be able to keep a very close eye on what's going on on the other side of the chamber for any tactical moves that might bring his strategy of the day unstuck.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another one of his great skills is that he is absolutely relentless, he is persistent and he has a committed work ethic. This guy doesn't ever leave anything in the tank, as we all know, and he will stay on the field until the absolute final siren, even when we're losing, with that tiny little hope that some miracle will occur and he will actually be able to win.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He is also extraordinarily generous. Mathias, I have been the recipient of your extraordinary generosity in terms of the time and the support that you have given to me. You've never ever shied away from spending time with me when I've had a problem, showing me the way forward. I thank you very much for the support that you've showed me. I believe that much of my success in my political career has been down to the fact that you backed me in and that you backed me in with those who made the decisions. So I thank you for where I am today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So much has been said today in the chamber about Mathias, and I wish to associate myself with just about all of those comments—maybe not a few of the ones that we just got from Katy! You will certainly be missed in this place. I am certainly going to miss you. I am even going to miss the WhatsApp at all hours of the day and night! I absolutely and definitely am going to miss the Leeuwin Estate chardonnay! But I suppose the one thing that we all probably should miss is your ruthless honesty. I'm not sure, 'No, Anne,' is ever going to be delivered in quite the same way as yours was. Look, mate: good luck, my friend. The next chapter of your life is, I'm sure, going to be just as exciting as the last one. I hope it's at the OECD, but, wherever it is, they are going to be very lucky to have you. Go well.</span>

We did some community television together and Senator Cormann's dogged discipline around sticking to the key messages and key lines around the Gillard government's carbon tax was endemically successful, I'm very sad to say.

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HZE" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SESELJA</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Australian Capital Territory</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Finance, Charities and Electoral Matters</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:56</span>):  It's good to associate myself with the very timely and generous remarks of many and to pay tribute to my good friend and colleague Mathias Cormann. Mathias and I met on a number of occasions before I was in this place. I remember meeting Mathias and Hayley and having a great night at a Young Liberals function, where we hit it off quite well, and I think that might have been one of our first meetings. But one of the meetings I remember most, before coming into this place, was around Christmas 2012, up here—Christmas party celebrations for the opposition, as it was then. I remember being sat down in Mathias's office, and he said to me: 'Zed, you should come join us here—it's very nice.' And I thought, 'Well, you know, there's something in that,' and I think it was Mathias's encouragement that was a very big part of my decision to come into this place. He did go on to say to me, 'You know, you're playing in the VFL; you should come play in the AFL!' And I'm glad that I did. I'm more of an NRL man myself, but I think, if we were to compare the Senate to the AFL, you'd have to acknowledge that, over the last few years, Mathias Cormann, for our team, has been our captain-coach and very much our best and fairest and has made an absolutely extraordinary contribution, and I think we can't overstate that contribution to the Senate, to our party and to our nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've had the great privilege of being assistant finance minister to our greatest ever finance minister, and it's wonderful to be able to learn from the best—it really is. But can I say that, as much as I've been able to learn a lot from Mathias and his amazing office and the way he does things—and the Deputy Prime Minister and I of course exchange notes on what it's like to work as assistant finance minister—I've got to say: the other part about being assistant to Mathias is that it's really quite easy, because he absolutely does everything. He just makes sure he gets it all done, and he does that in the most professional way.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">People have talked a lot about his energy and his commitment. I still remember that 30-plus-hour debate on Senate voting reform. The words 'Energizer Bunny' come to mind, in the way that Mathias stayed in there for the whole time—I think there were a couple of toilet breaks, but aside from that he was there—arguing the case, as the opposition were engaging in all sorts of games, and it was just a reflection of how much effort he puts in.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to have a couple of short reflections, briefly, before I finish, on Mathias as a thought leader for the Liberal Party—and, might I say, particularly for the conservatives within the Liberal Party as well. Mathias speaks passionately about seeing East and West Berlin and what that meant for his political philosophy—these ideas of freedom; these ideas of personal effort and reward for effort and stretching yourself. He speaks well, and he spoke very well in the speech again today. But I think also he has some other enduring values, about the importance of family, the importance of strong institutions and the value and worth and dignity of every human life. It is those things that I think have also made him a thought leader within our movement. Mathias, you've talked about being now 'Citizen' Cormann. Can I say—and I know many of my colleagues will appreciate this—that, to us, you are and will always be a very solid Citizen Cormann. We acknowledge that, and I want to acknowledge that on the record.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Can I say briefly that I think history will judge you very well. I think, in particular, you've had big moments where you've had to make big decisions, and you've been criticised for some of those decisions—I think, unfairly. I think history will judge the fact that you made the right decisions for our party and the right decisions for our nation, and I'd like the record to reflect that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just finally, I want to pay tribute to Hayley, and to Isabelle and Charlotte. Hayley is an amazing woman—an absolutely amazing woman. Of course, she has borne the burden that you have borne, but in a very different way and a very significant way. She has served our nation in being there for you and, as you point out, not just being an amazing wife and mother but going on to an extraordinary career of her own in the meantime. So I want to pay tribute to Hayley, and to Isabelle and Charlotte, and to thank her for lending you to our nation in this capacity for a number of years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We wish you well. I look forward to seeing your future endeavours. Certainly, I believe Paris will not know what has hit it!</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="00AOL" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator COLBECK</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Aged Care and Senior Australians and Minister for Youth and Sport</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:01</span>):  I too would like to make a short contribution to the valedictory for Senator Cormann—Mathias. I think it's important to associate myself with remarks across the chamber. It's Mathias's strength of character which is one of the things that's brought out the best in this place. There are not too many occasions where we all come together and we agree on something in the way that we have today, but, given Mathias's strength of character and his relationships across the chamber, this moment, where we all acknowledge the contribution that Mathias has made, is one of those moments that are the best of this place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He made a point in his speech about philosophy—what he believed in and why. That has carried him all the way through his time here. I sincerely hope that, through the OECD, the rest of the world gets the opportunity to have the benefit of that. I really do wish you the very best in that quest, Mathias. Your philosophy and, in particular, your character—particularly your character—which has been demonstrated by the comments that have been made around the chamber today, will be of enormous benefit.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I can retire, I think, a newspaper clipping from the <span style="font-style:italic;">Mercury</span> from 1981, where a former senator, Bob Brown, was extolling the virtue of building coal-fired power stations in the Fingal Valley when he was campaigning against renewable hydroelectricity in Tasmania. I think that can be retired back to my office, rather than being maintained here in the drawer in the chamber. I couldn't count the number of times I handed that to Mathias when he was responding to a question from our friends in the Greens.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The acknowledgement of his respect for this institution, I think, is a really important point, and I acknowledge the comments that Senator Wong made in that respect. This is an important chamber; it's an important institution, and it deserves the respect of all of us. It's very easy for us to get caught up in the hurly-burly of the contest across the chamber, but we all should remember what this institution is about and the importance of it. I acknowledge the comments that Senator Wong made with respect to the boundaries that we should all have in place in that sense. It's a really important sentiment and one we should remember. I too have felt the brunt of Senator Cormann at ERC, as so many on our side have, and the philosophy that he brings, but going in there when we're seeking resources—taxpayers' funds, taxpayers' resources—that we might want to expend is a really important discipline for us all. He always had a very strong and sound argument to back up his thoughts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Cormann has been an extraordinarily strong counsel for so many of us in this place. In the context of his leadership of the government in the Senate, he has been an extraordinarily strong shepherd in keeping the coalition working together and maintaining all of us where we needed to be—and, in the circumstances where some of us might not have been where we needed to be, making sure that we got there quickly. This is something senators would understand: I would regard Senator Cormann as a senator's senator. The fact that he's going out on estimates is probably the best demonstration of that. Senator Gallagher might like to see him go earlier, but we're very pleased—</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator COLBECK:</span>
                  </a>  In a generous way—I'm happy to acknowledge that, Senator Gallagher! But the fact that Mathias is going out on estimates demonstrates that he is a senator's senator. People in this chamber understand that context, I think. He acknowledged the work that he did with now Prime Minister Morrison with respect to the GST. I know that my home state, Tasmania, played a very robust role in that. But the outcome that was achieved as part of that process, as you acknowledged in your valedictory speech, Mathias, is an important one; it was an important one for the country. I would like to acknowledge that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As has been acknowledged across the chamber, he is a senator who gets things done, a minister who gets things done. We all have a time here. Mathias has acknowledged and understood his time, but using your time in this place effectively is a really important thing for us all to remember, because we all do have our time. He has done that and he has got things done, which is really important. His departure is going to be a huge loss to our side of politics—I think it will be a huge loss to the chamber—but I do hope that it will be a gain for the global finance organisation of the OECD. I really do wish him success in that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we all know, life is what happens to you while you're planning what you're going to do next. Whatever it is that happens next for you and your family, Mathias, I wish you all the very best. Thank you for your service to this chamber and to the country.</span>

Today is one of those events. It's an important day and a sad day. It's an important day for this Senate chamber, an important day for this coalition government and a very important day for Western Australia. We can't overstate just how significant this is. As someone who is very keen on the history of our parties and someone who is very keen on the history of this Senate chamber and our country, I suggest that there's been no more significant event in the life of this coalition government than the departure of our friend Mathias Cormann. We are all saddened by our loss but excited for Mathias and Hayley and the girls. It's not the end but the beginning of a bright, new and exciting chapter for Mathias, and we send him with our best wishes.</span>

I first met Mathias shortly after his arrival in Australia. Mathias and I have worked on some very big plans together, and they've been very visible. We've also worked on a few invisible plans. Again, it speaks to his character that Mathias's word is something that you can rely on; it is something that you can bank on.</span>

                  </a>  Yes, Captain Haddock, in the movie! I've got a Captain Haddock one coming up. It was a phrase that came to mind when we learnt that Senator Cormann would be leaving us. Of course, the question that came to my mind was: 'Whatever will we do?' In reflecting on that question, I thought about the contribution that Senator Cormann has made as leader in this place and in several significant roles in the coalition over a long time, both in opposition and in government. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The biggest one, to me—I've been here a bit over four years now, but I'm still a relatively young member of our team—is the mentoring and the nurturing, and the shepherding, as I think Senator Colbeck referred to it, of the younger members of our team, bringing us in, helping us to understand how we can effectively advocate for our communities and advocate our beliefs in the party room, and, as Senator Dean Smith rightly said, find ways to bring plans together and actually get some good outcomes for the people we represent. Senator Cormann said in his remarks that he feels some comfort in leaving here because he leaves behind a great team, and I just want to say to Senator Cormann that I think there is good reason for that—because of the mentoring that he has done, the investment he has made in other members in this place, in the members of his team. It is an amazing legacy that this country will benefit from for generations to come.</span>

You guided me through the processes—through preselection, what it takes to serve the party, how to position myself. Now, as the newest Western Australian senator for the Liberal Party, I'm here very much because of your support and I'm very grateful for it. </span>

I just want to put on the record my sincere thanks to you, and to Hayley as well. Hayley has been an incredible encouragement to me in my journey to get here and since being here—supportive. She is an amazing woman and she is so encouraging. If you spend any time with Hayley, you leave feeling encouraged. And your family is beautiful. My wife and I look to you guys. We look at how you manage the busyness of life in this job but still maintain a very strong and beautiful relationship, and as a father to your children. Those of us in WA are a little closer and we get to see the impact that you have on your children and the beautiful way that you as a father, in spite of the pressures on you, provide that amazing support to them.

                  </a>  Not leaving the party—that's good! Mathias, we're a very strong division, and it's a tribute to you. There are many others who have contributed to that, but I think it would be hard to find anyone who has had such an impact upon the WA Liberal Party. On behalf of other Liberal Party members, including those who are back home—we've got a state election coming up—I say there are so many candidates who I think would all love to be able to stand here like this today and just say thank you for what you've done. The great organisation that we have back there is very much a tribute to you, and I thank you very much indeed.</span>

What can I say but, 'Free at last, free at last!'?</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I first went to work for Mathias, I was only going to be there for a year or two but the things we all know about Mathias—the fine mind, the extraordinary work ethic and the ability to understand both the policy and the politics of an issue—kept me there and, in the end, helped bring me into the Senate. Opposition was tough, but Mathias absolutely made the most of it, with forensic use of orders for the production of documents, the changes to the public interest immunity claims which Senator Patrick spoke about, and a number of committee reports that changed the public debate on issues. This demonstration and proved level of achievement improved our public life and improved the Senate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my time as Mathias's senior staffer, I'd often get the question, with raised eyebrows, 'What's he like to work for?' I'd never say it was the easiest of jobs, but it was extraordinarily rewarding. Mathias's attention to detail was and is legendary, beyond the level of mere mortals such as myself. The standards he set for himself were incredibly demanding. The middle-of-the-night <span style="font-style:italic;">Sky News</span> slots—Western Australian time, that is—are legendary. Less well known are the draft committee reports, hundred of pages long, that were his holiday reading. But Mathias was also very conscious of the impact of the life we led on family and was always unhesitating in being as flexible as possible to make the demands, at least on his staff, more manageable. I'm not sure you always allowed yourself that leeway, Mathias, but certainly, from a staffing point of view, you were extraordinarily generous.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will add my thanks and acknowledgment to Mathias's staff, many of whom I worked with—in particular Natasha Lobo, who's been there from the beginning, but also exceptional people like Philippa Campbell, Daniel Clode, Chris Browne, Karen Wu and so many others. The fact that Mathias attracted and retained such exceptional people says a lot about Mathias as a boss but also Mathias as a man.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mathias is trustworthy and honourable. He has been in a position where he's had to take the hard decisions, and the thing that I most admire about you, Mathias, is that you have never shirked that responsibility. You're not one to dwell on the past, but history will record that bravery well. The accolades Mathias receives as Australia's longest-serving finance minister and, in my possibly biased opinion, the finest and, without doubt, the most influential finance minister are well earned. As Mathias has said many times, no-one is indispensable to the team, but, Mathias, you will be sorely missed. You have been a loyal boss, a good friend and a very supportive colleague. You are a wonderful servant to the conservative cause, to our great Liberal Party, to Western Australia and to our nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I described in my first speech how Mathias's advice led me to meeting Rebecca, so I won't repeat that today. Suffice it to say that your ongoing advice will be always highly valued by me and by so many of our colleagues. From Rebecca and my family to you, Hayley, Isabelle and Charlotte: all the best for whatever the future holds.</span>

I first spoke with Senator Cormann at estimates, and after a Remembrance Day event in Canberra in 2017, where Senator Cormann spoke movingly about the consequences of the First World War for his country of birth, Belgium. It was obvious to anyone who heard that speech the understanding Senator Cormann has of the human condition. But it was really after a tweet of mine—a rather inflammatory tweet, I hasten to add—when Senator Cormann phoned to ask if he could speak with me about it. I have to say it is not often my experience, Mr President, that my Twitter leads to the making of a new friend! Often have we met to have a glass of Western Australian wine or two, and/or champagne, and occasionally some corn chips as well. But this is the measure of Senator Cormann.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Not only in recent days, when people have said deservedly kind things, but even since before I came to this place, I have heard senators from all sides, and also members of the Liberal Party, say good things about Senator Cormann. He is someone who deals with people as he finds them, someone who is generous with people. He is someone who has the characteristics of both that other famous Belgian, Tintin—his morality and authenticity—and Asterix the Gaul, who is renowned for his shrewd intelligence and his bravery. I know Senator Cormann is very familiar with both these characters. Similarly, we both read <span style="font-style:italic;">Asterix</span> in Latin as part of the fun part of studying that language at school. I know that recently Senator Cormann's office purchased some Tintin-themed masks!</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Could I turn to Senator Cormann's office. Wise people in this building have told me that parliamentarians' offices often reflect the parliamentarian. Senator Cormann's staff members are professional, happy and always gracious to odd visitors to their office, and I thank them for that and for always making me feel welcome.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know from his own valedictory speech a short time ago the regard that Senator Cormann has for history and philosophy and for the greatness of democracy. We know that in this place it is not the people vibrant with passion for how Australia can be a better place who are unwanted but, rather, those who cease to care. The people in this place who are engaged, who do care, who are willing to have the argument both in the chamber and outside but to do so with respect, who can find common ground—for all of those people—Senator Cormann is an exemplar, and his kindness and his compassion for his fellow human beings is at the forefront.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Cormann, Australia has been very lucky to have you in this place, and your family have been very generous in that regard. And the OECD would be very lucky to have you as the Secretary-General. Wherever life takes you, you will always have your excellent character and your sense of humour. So it's not 'adieu' but, rather, 'bonne chance pour la suite et a bientot!'</span>

                    <span class="HPS-OfficeSpeech">The PRESIDENT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Time">13:23</span>):  I will take the opportunity to briefly conclude the debate. I promise to be brief. I will not repeat everything everyone has said but will tell a few anecdotes that illustrate the points that everyone has made, the common themes mentioned here today. Personally, I think we should all acknowledge, particularly those of us from the east, that the burden carried by people coming from the west, and by their families, to play an active role in public life in Australia is truly extraordinary. When you combine that with the work ethic of Mathias, which others have spoken about, the burden not only upon him but also on Hayley and the girls and those others close to him has been extraordinary. It is so much tougher because of the time differences and the sheer number of hours on planes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mathias's work ethic was demonstrated in many ways, but in my case, when I was ill, he had to step into my portfolio. All I remember is my staff telling me when I came back to work that it was fantastic because, at 11 o'clock on a Thursday night, when he got off the plane in Perth, their phones weren't lighting up with all the WhatsApp messages and emails that had been prepared on the plane on the way over, because every single minute was a minute to take advantage of for his purpose in public life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I sat on ERC for a couple of years, Mathias's command of detail—without meaning to begrudge anyone else—was truly extraordinary. The size of those folders and the breadth of government activity was very difficult for any person to get across, but Mathias did. I do think I hold the record as the only spending minister to come into ERC and, when having a program cut, offer up more and say, 'You can have the whole program.' It was the only time I think I saw Mathias's stone visage at ERC crack, because he hadn't had that happen before.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Without meaning to be flippant—someone else might have claimed the title—Mathias was the fixer of the government. The fixing of the government actually has to happen in this chamber. This is where announcements in the other place, down at the other end of this building, get turned into law and public resources get determined, whether they're tax cuts or spending programs. If you can't make this chamber work you can't make the Australian parliament work, and everyone has an experience of that. Mathias would happily prosecute a collective decision, and he did not take differences personally. I had my share of differences—life would be boring if we didn't—on our own side and on the other side, but Mathias always had the ability to go on with the collective decision that was taken with a common purpose. In the end, I would say that he held himself to the standards he expected of others, and that is really one thing we can all aspire to and share.</span>

To your family: very best wishes. To you professionally: very best wishes. Farewell for the last time from the chamber, if not from the work of the Senate over the next few weeks.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Pursuant to order, the Senate will now adjourn without debate. I remind senators that legislation committees will meet to consider estimates, commencing on Monday 19 October at 9 am.</span>
