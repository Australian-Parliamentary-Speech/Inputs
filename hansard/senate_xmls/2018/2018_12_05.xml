                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="H6X" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BIRMINGHAM</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">09:31</span>):  I dealt, at the conclusion of question time yesterday, with the substantive matters in relation to the order passed by the Senate in the motion moved by Senator Hanson. I suspect the bringing forward of the motion and the way in which it was structured were to enable a bit of grandstanding on antitrade rhetoric to occur in the chamber this morning. Sadly, that seems to be a more common occurrence from the crossbench and even from some in the opposition. I say 'sadly' because it is senators choosing to turn a blind eye to the facts, to the evidence, to the history, of the benefits that trade has provided to Australia. It's no accident that Australia has enjoyed 27 years of continuous economic growth. That growth is a function of good policy reforms, from both Liberal-National governments and Labor governments—to be fair and to give credit. We've seen governments of both persuasions open up our economy in a range of ways. Opening it up to provide greater opportunities for trade of goods, services and investment has been a key part of those reforms that have sustained our economic growth and our prosperity as a nation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the past five years, in our term of government, as we have successfully negotiated successive trade agreements to create a more open environment, trade has contributed around one-quarter of the estimated economic growth that we've seen. As a nation, our economic growth leads that of the world's largest economies. It leads the G7. Trade has contributed around one-quarter of that. In 2017-18 we achieved a record level of exports of $401 billion. Importantly—and I really encourage senators to reflect on this point—Australia has achieved a trade surplus every month of this year and for 20 out of the past 23 months. It is often portrayed, by those who want to use antitrade rhetoric, that somehow Australia does poorly, when the truth is quite the opposite. These are not meaningless statistics. They are a demonstration of how it is that increased trade opportunities have contributed to Australia's prosperity and have ensured that, through that prosperity, Australia is one of the best places in the world to live, as the prosperity enables Australians to pursue their ambitions and dreams and gives government the resources to be able to provide essential services. That's why our government has been such a strong supporter and effective deliverer of free and open trade. We know that it provides opportunities that Australian businesses successfully seize and, in doing so, provides more opportunities to Australian families.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We believe in supporting and backing our farmers, our technology companies, our artist, our scientist and our small and large businesses to develop the highest-quality goods and services and to be able to sell those not only in Australia but also in our region and around the world. We don't take a 'little Australia' mentality and believe that we're only fit to be able to compete within some closed shop environment here in Australia. We believe that, as a country, we are actually capable—as we have demonstrated—of competing around the world. That's why today around one in five Australian jobs is dependent upon trade—that is, around 2.2 million Australians. And we know that businesses that export also tend to pay better. On average, wages are an estimated 11½ per cent higher—significantly more.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australian household incomes are variously estimated to be around $8,500 higher due to trade liberalisation that's been undertaken in Australia since the 1980s. It's no accident that it's been because of our Liberal-National governments; the Howard years delivered the United States trade agreement, and our government has agreements with China, Japan and Korea and did the landmark CPTPP-11. All of them ensured we have more opportunities to sell more goods and services into the world. That's why we continue to fight at the G20, through APEC and at the World Trade Organization for effective global trade rules and we continue to pursue new trade agreements with Europe, Latin America and other regional trading blocs such as the RCEP agreement. Our government has the best, most successful track record of pursuing trade agreements and we will continue to work on doing so.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This motion was sparked by debate about the transparency of how those agreements are brought to force. We have very clear parliamentary processes to ensure thorough scrutiny of and deliberation on free trade agreements before they are ratified. As I outlined to the Senate yesterday, there was a letter that responded to this Senate order on 11 December 2013. It made very clear that the Senate can be assured that, once the text of trade agreements is agreed on between the two parties, but before they are ratified by the Australian government, they will be made public and will be subject to parliamentary scrutiny through the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties. This is consistent with our well-established treaty-making process. Each and every Australian free trade agreement that has come into force since this 2013 motion has gone through this proper parliamentary process, has been referred to JSCOT for inquiry. To ensure thorough scrutiny, agreements are tabled for 20 parliamentary joint sitting days before they're considered by the JSCOT inquiry. Let's again emphasise that point, because there seems to be some suggestions through this process that the text of agreements is withheld or not made public: the text of those agreements is tabled and sits on the table for 20 sitting days before JSCOT makes any determinations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, parliament can refer enabling legislation—or any other matter, for the point—to other committees for inquiry. By way of example, there was exceptionally broad scrutiny of the TPP. The regulatory impact statement and the accompanying national interest analysis were considered by JSCOT, as is standard practice for every one of our agreements. But they were also considered by the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee and the Senate Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. All of those inquiries were thorough, were public and had the full text of the agreements available to them. Each and every one of those inquiries had that. And each of them provided for the basis upon which, ultimately, binding treaty action was taken.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senators may also be aware that just recently we sent the Peru-Australia Free Trade Agreement back to JSCOT for a second inquiry, at the request of the Australian Labor Party. The Peru FTA was examined by JSCOT in August and in November of this year. Both times JSCOT has recommended that binding treaty action be taken, but both times JSCOT has had the opportunity with the public text, with the public national interest analysis and with the opportunity through public hearings and publicly accepted submissions to be able to get to the bottom of any issues in relation to those agreements.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Why is it that we adopt this process? We adopt it for transparency and thoroughness. But why is it that we don't say, 'We'll do all of that before the negotiations are settled'? It's because to do it all before the negotiations are settled weakens Australia's negotiating position. It weakens Australia's negotiating position to throw it all open to debate. Of course this parliament, the government, can choose to not ultimately ratify agreements. It happens at times around the world that agreements that are negotiated between two governments do not come into force; that can occur. However, we think that, to get the best possible deal, it's important to be able to conclude those negotiations up-front.</span>

                    </a>  Thanks, Deputy President. These questions around transparency are really a smokescreen for those who want to undermine and stand against a more open economy at any price. We see that in many ways from those on the 'lunar Left' and also those on what I'll politely call the 'reminiscent Right', who seem to think that somehow it was a better place decades ago, a perception which is built upon many myths and many untruths, such as the suggestion that somehow our trading relations have hurt employment. If we go back to the start of the 1980s, before Australia pursued the big waves of economic reform, the total number of employed Australians stood at around six million people. Today that's more than 12.6 million people. We've more than doubled employment over that time.</span>

Indeed, yes, the population has grown, but the proportion of the working-age population in employment is higher today than it was in the 1980s, Senator Hanson. We've created jobs faster than our population has grown. So that's another of your myths knocked out along the way. And indeed the mix of full-time versus part-time jobs has, contrary to the lies that are told, remained relatively stable during that time.</span>

                    </a>  Thank you for that reminder, Deputy President. As I was saying, the proportion of full-time and part-time jobs has remained largely stable. Employment growth has managed to outstrip population growth. More Australians are employed and a higher proportion of Australians are employed. Average unemployment, which has stood at around seven per cent over the last four decades, now stands at around five per cent. Some will tell us that we're poorer because of it, and yet GDP per capita, inflation adjusted, has grown significantly: it stood at around US$30,000 equivalent in 1980, it is around US$55,000 equivalent today. Those several decades of economic reform, including more open trading environments, have left us in a world where Australia has a higher proportion of the population employed, has more than doubled the number of jobs that exist across the country and has a higher average per-capita GDP rate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a pity that indeed those on the fringes of politics now seem in some ways to be being joined by some from the Labor Party, because what has occurred, at least over recent decades, is we've had significant bipartisanship in many of these ventures. Bipartisanship during the Hawke and Keating years enabled many of the economic reforms to occur during that time—perhaps slightly less so during the Howard years around some economic reforms—but, ultimately we saw bipartisanship enable a number of trade agreements to come to fruition, and I thank the Labor Party for that over that time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We do see that 89 per cent of Australian businesses that export indicate that they use our FTAs as a platform for their exports. We appreciate that the Greens have never really understood the benefits of trade, because they'll stand against anything that sounds like it might relate to opportunities for business, ignoring the fact that business creates jobs that pay taxes that sustain our services. And we know that those on the far Right have tended to take a closed-shop mentality and to adopt that little-Australia perspective. They believe that if we could just live within our own contained built-up brick walls around the margins of Australia, we would be a much better place. Instead, of course, we've benefited greatly from being more open. We see the unions seeking to push the Labor Party around. They sought to push Mr Shorten to walk away from the TPP and he said we shouldn't pursue it when Donald Trump walked away, but I thank the Labor Party for the fact that they held their nerve and they ultimately supported the TPP coming to fruition.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to be clear that all parts of Australia don't always benefit from every aspect of every agreement. That's why successive governments have supported transition packages industry support, but, ultimately, Australia is better as a result of the collection and the wave of economic reforms, including those trade agreements. Indeed, Senator Hanson's home state of Queensland is also a significant beneficiary. In 2017-18, Queensland's total exports of goods were valued at over $74.2 billion, a rise of 11.5 per cent over the previous year. That was driven significantly by exports of goods to FTA partner countries—those countries with which we have free trade agreements in place. Those exports were valued at $49.7 billion, which is well over half of Queensland's total exports, and the growth rate to those countries was 15.4 per cent, well in excess of the average growth rate. So Queensland exports grew, but they grew faster to countries with whom we have FTAs in place. China, Japan and Korea are critical trading partners and account for more than half of Queensland's total goods exports. Our government has negotiated trade agreements with those three significant markets that lock in exports for significant commodities like coal at zero, enabling us to ensure that we have strong growth.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But it's not just those commodities. We also see many services industries and other goods actually benefiting. Take Russell Mineral Equipment located in Toowoomba, who have benefited clearly from our policies. They design and manufacture minerals processing equipment. They're one of the great examples that show that, although Australia is strong in the mining sector, the mining services companies are also increasingly exporting their goods and skills to the rest of the world. Our FTAs with North Asia have played a key role in Russell Mining Equipment's success according to their CFO. He says:</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Having them in place gives us the confidence to invest money into foreign markets and ensures we are protected against risks such as intellectual property theft and copyright.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's an example of a Toowoomba based business creating more income for Australia and more jobs for Australians by selling their services to the world. Or how about Frosty Boy located in Yatala in Queensland, a manufacturer and distributor of powdered desserts and beverages? In the last 12 months, this Gold Coast based company has grown 30 per cent and now employs around 70 Australians. Its managing director says that exports have played a vital role in the company's growth. He says:</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">We have not only increased the number of product lines we export, but due to the growth in our exports, we've also invested in new dairy equipment and accessories to increase our production. Our exports now make up 70 per cent of our business. Since 2001, we have seen an average yearly growth of about 17 per cent. It is definitely our exports that have enabled us to achieve this kind of growth.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Or there's OzKleen, located on the Gold Coast. They identify FTAs with North Asia as helping them to expand their business. Their managing director says:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Thanks to the FTAs, we have been able to significantly reduce our landed costs, making our product more price competitive.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">this tariff reduction combined with a positive exchange rate has seen the import price of our cleaning products come down by 10.5 per cent, which makes a big difference to the overall price of the product.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's the point. Those Australian products are landing in Korea at a cheaper price because Korea is no longer applying, effectively, a tax to them, meaning that a Gold Coast business like that is able to better succeed into the future. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know some will cite manufacturing jobs, which, if you look at ABS data, have been on the increase again recently. One of the reasons, there, is that you see more companies, both domestic and international, investing in Australia in higher technology spaces. Take the Peruvian manufacturing company Vistony. Vistony has indicated that the Peru-Australia agreement will be of 'great value for us as a leader of Peruvian lubricants, as lower tariffs generate greater investment'. Why is that good for Australia? Because that company has indicated that they're setting up operations here in Australia. They will create approximately 200 jobs as a result of doing so. That's another example of where an Australian trade agreement has helped to create more job opportunities. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As others contribute and follow me in this debate, I urge the Senate to be mindful of some of the real facts that sit before us. Fact 1: all our trade agreements and the text around them are published, made public, laid bare and tabled in the parliament before they are ratified and before binding treaty action is taken. Fact 2: they're all assessed by the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties and, frequently, other parliamentary committees as part of that process. Fact 3: the successive decades of economic reform we've had have got Australia to a point where we're enjoying trade surpluses, month after month. I go back to the opening point I made: a trade surplus every month this year and for 20 out of the past 23 months. That's the strength of Australia's trading situation and economic relationship. Fact 4: over those decades of reform, we've seen employment more than double in Australia and participation in the employment market grow far faster than our population has grown. Fact 5: we've seen unemployment rates come down. Fact 6: we've seen average GDP per capita go up. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is better off as a result of the reforms of the last few decades. We're better off as a result of more open engagement with the rest of the world. Our businesses are successfully seizing those business opportunities, are successfully engaging. In doing so, they're creating more business opportunities in Australia, creating more jobs in Australia, creating more opportunities for Australians and their families and that's generating more revenue for our government to provide the services we rely upon, and those who want to undermine that would be undermining Australia's very prosperity. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Former Liberal Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull called the half a million Australians who voted for One Nation in the last federal election 'dumb'. This assessment of voters is one of the reasons the government ignored the requirement to consult with the Senate in advance of signing the comprehensive and progressive agreement for the Trans Pacific Partnership or TPP-11 on 8 March 2018. The facts are not in dispute. The government did not table the TPP-11 in advance of signing it. The government holds the Senate in contempt by not complying with Senate rules, which require these types of documents to be tabled at least 14 days before signing. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The failure by the Attorney-General to release the full legal advice on Brexit triggered a vote in the British parliament yesterday which found ministers in contempt of the parliament and ordered the immediate publication of the advice. The British government, after the vote, said they would publish the advice. The parallels between the failure of this government to table the TPP-11 and the failure of the British government to table the Brexit advice are obvious. The difference between the two governments is that our government think contempt is a badge of honour while the British government think it's a badge of shame.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government have told us they will not bend to the will of the Senate and table free trade agreements in advance of signing them. They say they will continue to ignore the will of the Senate and the people of Australia and make the agreements public after they have been signed, leaving no option for those affected but to accept it. Deals done in secret always raise concerns about corruption. Instead of persuading the Senate to change the procedural order of continuing effect 20, the government prefer to treat the Senate as a rubber stamp. Although the government signed up to the TPP-11 in March, it took until October for the government to present the enabling legislation to the Senate. I did not support the TPP-11 enabling legislation in the hope that the government would be unable to complete all the applicable legal procedures necessary for entry into force of the agreement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am worried about the TPP-11 free trade agreement because jobs will go overseas and because landmine provisions known as investor-state dispute settlement provisions, or ISDS provisions, remain. The damage these ISDS provisions have on us is illustrated by the Philip Morris case. Philip Morris decided to sue the Australian government after the passage of the Tobacco Plain Packaging Act in 2011. The company could have sued the Australian government in an Australian court, but they thought their chances were better in an international tribunal using international law. Philip Morris looked for a suitable free trade agreement with Australia and then restructured their business to create an overseas parent company in Hong Kong. The government says it won the Philip Morris case, but in fact the case was not heard because the tribunal decided it was an abuse for them to restructure just to sue the Australian government. Challenges to Australia's tobacco packaging policy continue within the World Trade Organization. We should never have allowed the decision of a three-person tribunal operating under international laws to override the High Court of Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One Nation rejects the view of globalists like Malcolm Turnbull who want us to surrender our hard-won freedom to make laws that apply to Australians and those who trade with us. The decision to sign the TPP-11 agreement without complying with Senate order of continuing effect 20 is, in my view, a serious matter. My fellow senators agree with me, because notice of motion 1295, standing in my name, was supported by the Senate yesterday. That motion brought Minister Birmingham here today to explain the government's position. I call on the government to test its public interest immunity argument, and its failure to comply with Senate procedure, before the High Court. It is just wrong that these free trade agreements are not reviewed in the Senate. Some might say it is a waste of money to go to the High Court, but we reportedly spent $50 million on the Philip Morris case, so, frankly, a few thousand dollars is money well spent if we can rid ourselves of the ISDS provisions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has told the Senate the ISDS provisions represent a theoretical risk, but I know of two cases that have been brought against Australia in recent years, including the most recent case involving APR Energy. In 2016, APR Energy advised the government of a dispute under the Australia-United States Free Trade Agreement. The company is suing the Australian government because the assets it leased to an Australian company were repossessed by the ANZ Bank. An international tribunal will be asked to decide if the Australian government is liable for the company's losses pursuant to the provisions of the Personal Property Securities Act 2009. Does this mean that every overseas company that loses money can be compensated by the Australian taxpayer? I warned the parliament in 1998 about multilateral agreements on investment provisions which included the right to sue governments if legislation threatened their interest. No-one took any notice of me, and here we are with ISDS provisions in most free trade agreements acting like landmines just waiting to blow up.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These ISDS provisions expose taxpayers to staggering losses incurred by non-resident foreign-owned companies. Australia is particularly exposed to ISDS losses because of the number of multinational companies operating here. These multinationals can pick and choose from an array of free trade agreements when they want to sue the Australian government. These companies have revenues greater than most countries in the world and deep pockets to fund actions against governments. The provisions that allow foreign-owned multinational companies to sue the Australian government are not in the national interest. Their existence in many agreements, including the TPP-11, may be a factor in the government's unwillingness to reform weak laws that give us payment for our vast reserves of gas in Commonwealth waters. Are the benefits of free-trade agreements which include investor-state dispute settlement provisions worth the risk of being sued in an international tribunal? The answer to that question depends on whether you are a winner or a loser in TPP-11. In my view, the risks in the TPP-11 outweigh the benefits.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">New Zealand has side letters voiding the ISDS provisions. So why don't we have the same?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has oversold the benefits of the TPP-11. Take for example the claim that our dairy industry will benefit by being given access to the Canadian dairy market. The claim sounds good—until you find out that the 11 Pacific rim countries will collectively be given access to just 3.5 per cent of the Canadian dairy market and that New Zealand, a lower-cost dairy country, is making heavy inroads into the Australian market.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If the government had its way, it would continue to sign free trade agreements without ever consulting the Senate. The opposition voted with the government to pass the enabling TPP-11 legislation, but now, after the horse has bolted, say they will negotiate changes when they form government next year. Labor cannot get the TPP-11 changed. It's pie-in-the-sky fantasy. The ISDS provisions will remain. Jobs will go overseas, and 5,000-plus jobs in Australia will be taken by foreign workers. Their comments are to appease the unions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The kind of accountability small parties bring to government is a thorn in the side of the two major parties. Increasingly, Australians are voting for small parties in the Senate. This is evidenced by the fact that nearly one in four primary votes were cast for a small party in the 2016 federal election. In my view, the two-party system, where government is formed by one of the two major parties, no longer serves the national interest.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I can assure the people of Australia: I'm here because of no fear or favour. I'm here to work for the Australian people and to call for accountability from this government and from anyone who is in government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I can see a time when government is formed by a coalition of smaller parties. It works well in Germany, where it has provided stability and prosperity for the largest economy in Europe.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I must go to some of the minister's comments. He said that unemployment is down, and he said this has happened since the 1980s. Well, I would like to refer the minister to the fact that unemployment in the 1960s was 2.6 per cent. He said that people are out there with more jobs in Australia. But more people are working because, in families, both the husband and the wife have to work to pay for the ever-increasing cost of living in this country. At one time, women were able to stay home and raise their children; now they can't have that option because they must pay the bills. So it's all pie in the sky. He's talking through his hat as far as I'm concerned.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Talking about free trade agreements, from the day that they signed the free trade agreement with America, from day one, we got rid of all of our tariffs, and America kept their tariffs on, from 11 to 18 years, on wool, wine, horticultural products, cotton and beef. So it has not been in the best interests of Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am not opposed to free trade agreements. But make sure they are in the best interests of our country. Don't hold the Senate in contempt—which you have done. Abide by the rule of order 20: lay the documents on the table 14 days beforehand.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:03</span>):  I would just like to comment on the minister's 20-minute address, which fundamentally failed to explain why the government was not complying with the Senate's order for the production of documents, order of continuing effect 20, which requires that the full text of the proposed bilateral and multilateral agreements be laid on the table by the minister at least 14 days before the signing of those documents.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister made some feeble effort to argue that the trade processes we have at the moment are, somehow or other, transparent. Let the reality be clear: the process we have at the moment is nothing but opaque, and the minister himself says, 'We don't have to provide the documents and we won't provide the documents, because to provide the documents would weaken our negotiating position.' In fact, what occurs is that documents are provided only after those documents have been signed by the Commonwealth of Australia. The consequence of that is that then the only opportunity we have of dealing with that legislation is to change the enabling legislation; there is not a proposition put to the parliament on acceptance or rejection of that trade agreement. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, this continuing order is based on the United States. Senator Wong in the Senate noted that the United States' trade representatives undertake to publish the full text of the free trade agreements negotiated on behalf of the United States well before the signing. That allows the US Congress and the US people to assess the provisions. Actually telling the people of the United States what the government of the United States is proposing to do when it engages in these foreign treaties doesn't seem to undermine its negotiating position. It doesn't seem to affect many other countries around the world that have a similar provision. That's why the Labor Party has proposed a fundamental reform of these treaty-making provisions under the A Fair Go for Australians in Trade Bill 2018, which has now received a second reading in this chamber, and we're waiting for it to come back to this chamber. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The fundamental problem we have here is that the agreements that are entered into by Australia are talked up, as we've seen here today, in a manner which does not reflect the reality of the operations of those agreements. This is not just about people who are, as the minister disparagingly said, antitrade. I can tell you now that I don't regard myself as antitrade. In introducing the A Fair Go for Australians in Trade Bill 2018 in the Senate, I made a point about the importance of trade and that Australia is a trade dependent economy. I regard myself as an internationalist. That has long been the case for those interested in social democracy. What I am interested in is the question of Australian sovereignty and the effect of these trade agreements, which, in their operation, don't bear fruit in terms of the claims and assertions made about them by the modellers and proponents of these agreements. It is not just people on the left who make this point, as the minister seemed to suggest. The Productivity Commission—that well-known left-wing organisation!—made the point again in its recent trade review: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Overall, the Commission concluded in 2010 that the economic benefits of bilateral trade agreements have generally been oversold and the risks have been understated. The Commission recommended that agreements should be reached only when they provide outcomes that are in Australia's interest and they are the most cost-effective way of achieving those outcomes. The Commission further recommended that there should be more transparent and rigorous assessments of such agreements. This should encompass two elements. To ensure agreements are in the Australia's interest, before negotiations commence, modelling should include realistic scenarios and be overseen by an independent body. After negotiations have concluded and prior to signing of the agreement, a full and public assessment should be undertaken covering all of the actual negotiated provisions. As with all areas of policy, trade agreements need to be considered on a case-by-case basis, and the balance of benefits and costs for future agreements may be different, for example because they cover a smaller share of Australian trade.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister makes great play about the significance of trade in terms of the changes that have occurred in Australian society over the last generation, and he places particular emphasis in saying a quarter of the growth that has occurred is due to trade. One-third of our trade is now with the People's Republic of China—our biggest single trading partner. Is there any better example of how clumsy, inept and incompetent this government has been than the treatment of our single largest trading partner, to the point that this minister, the trade minister before him and senior ministers couldn't even get an appointment!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I deal a great deal with universities. Vice-chancellors tell me about the importance of our international education system, and they constantly say to me, 'I hope they know what they're doing,' because it is not apparent to anyone else that the government know what they're doing. They're a government riven by chaos, riven by confusion. This is the proposition that we find across the Australian corporate sector. We see it not just in the corporate sector, though. Organisations representing workers, trade unions; NGOs; and the wider public are very, very concerned about the way this minister and the ministers before him have kept the public in the dark. This is a perfect example of it. They have refused to engage properly in a discussion about the future directions of this country because they have no idea what the future directions of this country are. Look at what they've done with Indonesia. They said they'd have a trade agreement signed before Christmas, except they went on this little frolic in the richest part of Sydney and said, 'Maybe we'll move our embassy in Israel to Jerusalem.' But what did they do? 'Oh, we forgot about the implications,' of that little frolic for short-term political advantage—they thought. They don't even understand what's happening within the Jewish community in this country, let alone what's happening in the largest Muslim country in the world, to our north.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a government that is riven by crisis and short-termism. It's a government that does not know what to do other than to desperately hang on to office, one day at a time. One day at a time—that's how this government operates. This is a government of nightwatchmen, with the blinds pulled down, hoping to Christ that nobody knocks on the door and wakes them up. The members of the government are desperate because they're so busy fighting amongst themselves that they've got no idea what the direction of this country is, no idea where to take this country, no idea what to do, no idea how to actually take this country forward. They're exhausted. They're exhausted by their own internal battles. Now they say, 'We're not going to tell you what we're up to'—frankly, because they don't know themselves. That's the real reason: they don't know themselves. They're going to assert that these great benefits have come from their actions. Well, the reality is very different when you look at it close up. It's not to weaken our negotiating position that the government want to keep the parliament in the dark. It's because the government don't know where they're going, don't know where this country is going and have no idea about how we should advance the interests of the Australian people. They are just so preoccupied now with surviving from one day to the next.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a simple proposition we have before us today—that we should get to see these trade agreements before they're signed, not be left in the lurch as we have been with the TPP. We should be left in a position where we can properly discuss them. This is not an outrageous proposition. This is a Senate that has many provisions whereby we provide advice on quite serious matters, and we have done so for a very long time, whether it's on shipping lists, grants to shipping companies, health funds or matters with regard to government advertising. It is not an outrageous suggestion that the government actually tell people what they're up to before they sign agreements that have such far-reaching consequences and that may well have massive implications for particular sectors and particular regions of our society. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:14</span>):  There's an old saying: 'There's nothing new under the sun.' Just to remind senators, we've had this debate—exactly the same debate—in this chamber numerous times over the last six years. I remember I put up an order for the production of documents in the early stages of the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement, in 2014. Although the Senate voted for that order for the production of documents, the government refused to bring in any documents at all. I remember going and speaking to the previous Clerk of the Senate, Rosemary Laing, and I said, 'What do you do when the government is not complying with an order of the Senate?'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">She got out <span style="font-style:italic;">Odgers</span>—I remember the exact spot she went to in <span style="font-style:italic;">Odgers</span>—and said to me: 'All you can do is disrupt their legislative agenda. If they won't comply with the order of the Senate, then every time something comes up on trade, every time we debate some legislation, you need to basically make their life hell'—more or less; those weren't her exact words, but that's my interpretation of what she said. We're still here, six years later, talking about lack of transparency around trade deals.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If anybody wants an informed document to read about exactly what we're debating today, then I suggest they go to the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee's report, <span style="font-style:italic;">Blind agreement: how to reform the treaty making process</span>. I was part of that committee; in fact, I initiated that inquiry into the treaty-making process. We had a number of senators in this chamber on that committee, and it was a great piece of work. It talked about the urgent need to reform our treaty-making process—the treaty-making process that allows agreement like the Trans-Pacific Partnership and other agreements like the Chinese free trade agreement or the US free trade agreement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This treaty-making process is hundreds of years old. It hasn't changed since we adopted the Westminster system in this country. It goes back to almost precolonial days, when governments were able to negotiate treaties with other nations following wars. It gives an executive government complete power over parliament, and that's exactly what has happened. There's nothing complicated about this. The executive can negotiate through these processes not just trade deals in the sense that we tend to think—'We're going to swap goods and commodities with other countries'; that's not what trade deals are these days—but trade deals that are a holistic set of regulations between countries. It's an attempt to synchronise regulations between countries, regulations that affect just about every aspect of our lives. The Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement had 33 chapters that covered every aspect of Australians' lives. It had very little to do with traditional trade. It had very little to do with that at all. It's about a global rules based order. And guess what? Parliament doesn't get a look-in at all.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the years of the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement—negotiations started in 2010—the only information we got on the text of that agreement was from WikiLeaks. The only information we got, thank goodness, was from Julian Assange's WikiLeaks, where we had downloads of what was going on. Do you think civil society could get into any of the meetings that were occurring behind closed doors between big business and governments? No, they couldn't. This was all negotiated behind closed doors, in secret.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want everybody to stop and think about what exactly this trade negotiation is—this trade deal that we're talking about. It's not just what you see on TV, where you see minister wearing a floral shirt in another country who is about to sign a piece of paper. It's not about governments and DFAT negotiators behind closed doors. Think about it: this is about business coming together, going to government with vested interests and saying, 'We want you to negotiate improved access in these countries for us so we can make more profit, so we can make more money.' That's where it all starts. Governments act on their behalf, and then we get these agreements that the parliament doesn't get to look at until they're signed. That point has been made very clearly by Senator Hanson this morning and by Senator Carr. It's a joke. These are signed before they come to parliament; in other words, the government, the executive, agrees to this without the Australian people, without their representatives in parliament, even having a look or a say.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The JSCOT is the committee that we set up to look into this, but the JSCOT is a rubber stamp; it is a government-dominated committee. It will never reject a trade deal—never! And, by the way, you can't change a single thing, a single word, without the entire trade agreement falling apart. You can't amend it and you can't improve it, because it's signed and sealed by the executive. It's a direct snub at the parliament of this country, as it is in other countries. It's totally unacceptable. It railroads our democratic process, and it's allowed to do this because the treaty-making process hasn't been properly reformed since its inception. The JSCOT itself was a suggested reform: an attempt to try to give some kind of semblance of democracy to the negotiation of these deals. But it has failed completely, so the whole thing needs reform. We, the Greens, put in a dissenting report to that treaty-making process committee report. Nevertheless, I think that all parties agree in here that it needs reform and that it needs reform urgently.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have pointed out consistently that the Trans-Pacific Partnership agreement is a dangerous agreement, not just for Australia but for many countries. We can't allow our rules and regulations to be written in this country by corporations for corporations. They are the power behind the throne in terms of these agreements. Have absolutely no doubt about it, transnational or multinational corporations—whatever you want to call them—push these agreements because they have operations in all the countries associated with them. They want to synchronise rules and regulations, such as investment rules, between countries to get what they want.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The investor-state dispute settlement clauses are a classic example of that. We had a separate Senate inquiry into ISDS and it got international attention; everybody wanted to know what the Australian government was going to do around ISDS. It is totally unnecessary in countries that have good legal systems. It is designed to give corporations the chance to second-guess and to intimidate parliaments. Again, that is antidemocratic. These are Trojan Horse clauses that are totally unacceptable in a modern trade deal. There is no need for them, they are proliferating, they have a number of adverse consequences and just about everybody agreed that we shouldn't have them in our trade deals. The only reason they were kept in the trade deals was because both Labor and the Liberals felt like they didn't want to be bound by this in case it jeopardised future trade negotiations. That's not a good enough reason to have an antidemocratic, dangerous ISDS clause in a trade deal.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So we've got to this point where we're having this debate again, asking the government to provide the information to the Senate. It won't, because it doesn't want to give up its executive power. It wants, essentially, to be able to have a parallel parliament and a process that completely circumvents our democratic parliamentary process because it has the power to do this and it will not give that up. Have a think about when these proliferations of trade deals started. They started in 2013, when the Abbott government was elected. Suddenly, we had this plethora of trade deals being signed: five trade deals. They were great photo shoot opportunities. We got really crappy modelling around all of these trade deals; just about every decent economist in this country said, 'The modelling is not worth the paper it's written on,' including the TPP modelling. Even the modelling that was done showed negligible benefits. We never have an honest debate in this country around trade. All we hear about are the benefits; we never focus on the cost. That's why I applaud Senator Hanson for bringing this forward today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With every trade deal that we sign, and they cover just about every aspect of our lives, there are costs. We can have an argument about whether there is a net cost or a net benefit, but at least be honest with the Australian people: there are costs to these deals. While we get access for our exporters, we open up our markets, as you well know, Mr Acting Deputy President O'Sullivan, to foreign companies which actually sell products and undermine our local producers as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The car industry is a classic example, and there are so many more. In fact, I remember that the Korean free trade deal was called by the media in this country the 'cows for cars' deal. We traded away our car industry for more access for beef farmers. Who gets to decide whether beef farmers should win over car manufacturers? We don't get to decide it as an Australian people and we don't get to decide it as an Australian parliament. Who gets to decide it? It's the executive and the ideology—I would say the blind ideology—behind the blind treaty-making process that's in this country which allows this kind of circumvention of our democracy to occur.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I applaud bringing this forward. With every opportunity we have we should put pressure on this government to show some transparency around trade.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:24</span>):  I too rise to take note of Minister Birmingham's response to the order.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it's worth putting on the record once again that in the space of the trade ministry since 7 September 2013 there have been three ministers: Minister Robb, Minister Ciobo and Minister Birmingham, assisted by assistant ministers Colbeck, Pitt, Hartsuyker and Coulton. Everywhere you look with this government, you look at a ministry and you realise that, in the short five years that they've been on the benches opposite, there's been a procession of people through the ministerial positions. Now, that could work out in the long run to be a good thing, but the evidence seems to indicate that it's not a particularly effective way of delivering successful outcomes for the country. And if you go back over the history, there were three ministers of trade in the entire Howard government period. I just put that on the table.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I get really interested when the other side keep saying, 'The Hawke-Keating period did this, that and the rest of it, and it was all great.' Well, if you glance at my bio and at Minister Birmingham's bio, you'll realise that he was in primary school when Bob Hawke was elected and probably completing studies at a university or organising a student union at a university when Keating was unelected. But I actually lived through all of that time, as a Labor Party member and a unionist, and it was a hard struggle to convince workers in all sectors that free trade agreements were useful to the country, because they certainly weren't popular, and they're not popular now. But there is no-one on that side doing the hard work of convincing people of the benefits of these free trade agreements. I can remember various Hawke-Keating ministers saying: 'Yes, there are going to be jobs lost in the economy, but we're going to replace them with better jobs. There will be better jobs. The economy is going to shift. These opportunities are good in aggregate for the country. We will make sure you're employed, and you will have better opportunities, particularly in the textile industry.' The textile industry was a classic. We then had the opportunity for families in marginal areas of the economy to purchase shoes, clothes and school uniforms at a much cheaper rate, but we lost jobs in Australia. It was a really harsh reality. But the advocacy was to take that issue head on and say, 'You're going to get better jobs.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I, along with other senators in the chamber, have sat through all of the inquiries into the Japanese-Australia Economic Partnership Agreement, the Korea-Australia Free Trade Agreement, the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement, the TPP and the TPP-11, and I have read the submissions that have come in to all of these very useful inquiries. We put the reference in here about treaty making because of the evidence and the submissions we were getting and because there was a general agreement that treaty making needs to be more transparent. There is abundant evidence for this right around the world, outside of the Westminster systems. The Westminster system is basically: trade agreements are executive prerogative—whatever the minister wants to sign and get through cabinet is effectively what goes into the parliament. There is no say on the treaty per se; there is only a vote on the enabling regulations which give effect to tariff cuts and arrangements. That's the Westminster system, unlike the US, where people are invited into the treaty-making process—business, unions, people representing groups in the community. We've looked at all that and said, 'Why wouldn't Australia reform its treaty-making process to make it much more transparent?' Because we're not just talking about wool, sheep, iron ore, coal, zinc and aluminium; we're talking about an export of services.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was in the United Arab Emirates. An Australian university has a campus in Dubai, and they were saying, 'This is an export of services.' I said, 'But how does it actually work?' The lecturers in Dubai are in a tax-free environment, and that's why it's attractive for them to go and work in Dubai. The university in Australia is getting government funds but making a profit in another jurisdiction, which is tax free. Where is the net benefit to Australia in all of this? The answer was that, if anything is repatriated back to the university in Australia, there will be less government funding put in. I said: 'Where's the incentive for them to do that? Why would you repatriate profits from overseas back to Australia and decrease your funding stream?'</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When you look at services and education, it's extraordinarily complex. We've had three ministers in five years and four assistant ministers in five years. I would suggest that they would've had to take a little bit of time to get their head around these very complex issues. As Senator Carr says, there are many chancellors of universities who are very interested in this space who hope the government know what they're doing. We would hope that they would actually be a little bit more transparent. I don't think it's unreasonable to expect transparency on bilateral agreements about labour movement.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This morning we had a briefing from the MIKTA group, which includes Mexico. Mexico is quite a buoyant economy in a lot of ways. What I really know though is that that labour force in Mexico underpins the ninth largest economy in the world with legal and illegal labour. So those 90-odd million people in California—their agriculture and a lot of their economy would actually collapse without cheap Mexican labour. That's a fact of a Mexican-American free trade agreement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've got the same understanding that the TPP-11 could involve labour mobility. We can have a Peruvian electrician come over here and work in Australia, and, if they're appropriately qualified and there's a need for that, that's probably not a bad thing. But there is no transparency on this. There is a complete absence of transparency.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The ISDS provisions are only supported in the treaty-making process by the minerals lobby. The Minerals Council of Australia and their representatives are the only ones who support ISDS. There is no other support—those are the submissions to the various inquiries. They support it, quite rightly, because, if they make an investment in Indonesia or Africa or somewhere and they are at risk of losing that investment, they can take them to the international dispute-settling arena and seek redress. But there is no other person.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Agriculture doesn't support it. When we asked the people in agriculture what they thought of the ISDSs, they said: 'It doesn't matter to us. We're not interested. It doesn't apply to us.' We know that, with the case of the Hong Kong free trade agreement, it can severely impact on us. So we're of a mind to look at that issue very carefully, and we've made that very clear to the government. The government is saying: 'Trust—trust is all you need. We will do the right thing.' They don't even get out and argue. Let's not beat around the bush here: free trade agreements or trade agreements are not popular everywhere. You have to do the hard yards of going out and talking to people about it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If we look at the China-Australia Free Trade Agreement, which is touted as the icon, we didn't need an agreement to get millions of tonnes on every tide in Western Australia to China. Their capacity to make steel drove that. We didn't need an agreement to do that. When we look at the agricultural aspects of it, particularly the phytosanitary barriers for vegetables, we can't get the best blueberries in the world from Tasmania to China because someone's written a barrier—a quarantine barrier or another barrier. These are not free trade agreements. There is no freedom about it. In a lot of cases, particularly in the area of Australian vegetables, for which exporters are seeking to get access to the Chinese market, there are enormous barriers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If you press the department, they will always say, 'Oh, but that's Austrade.' Then, when you go to Austrade, they will say, 'That's the Department of Agriculture and Water Resources.' Then, when you get their heads together and ask, 'Why have we done an agreement that doesn't actually get us access?' they'll say, 'In aggregate, it's a good deal.' The problem is we don't get to examine it. I concur with Senator Whish-Wilson and others: transparency, disclosure and inclusion in the treaty-making process would benefit everybody in Australia. It would still be a difficult task, but it would be a lot better than the blind treaty-making process that we currently have. That's what it is; it is a blind treaty-making process.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend the motion to the Senate. As senators would be aware, we were about to deal with the proposed amendments to the Sex Discrimination Act from 11 am onwards. I think that there is a desire from all parties across this chamber to find a sensible way forward in relation to the important amendments to this bill. I think that there is broad consensus around this chamber to remove inappropriate discrimination against kids in schools and other education institutions based on their sexual orientation and other related matters. But there is also a desire, so far unresolved, among many good people around Australia to see appropriate and reasonable protection remain in place for religious schools, enabling them to conduct their affairs consistent with the tenets of their respective religions. In order to facilitate engagement between all parties as appropriate, the government and the opposition have reached agreement to take some more time. The Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition have had a level of engagement. We believe it is in the public interest for those conversations to be allowed to continue for a bit longer. On that basis, I'm moving this motion to deal with a series of other priority government bills so that this process in relation to the amendments to the Sex Discrimination Act can continue to take place in good faith and in good order.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="00AOU" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WONG</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:37</span>):  I rise to indicate that the opposition will be supporting the Leader of the Government's motion. I thank him for the way in which, whatever our differences, he has dealt with these matters honourably. It is a motion that will have an inevitable and disappointing outcome, which is that Labor's bill to remove discrimination against LGBTIQ students in our schools will be delayed until next year. It is a disappointing outcome because it means LGBTIQ kids now face the prospect of returning to school next year knowing that they could be expelled or discriminated against because they are gay. Only weeks ago it was clear that there was broad support in the parliament for removal of discrimination against LGBTIQ students. Certainly, before the Wentworth by-election Mr Morrison told Australians: 'I believe it is very important we act in this parliament over the next fortnight to deal with the unnecessary anxiety that has been created for children and their parents in relation to potential discrimination and expulsion of students on the basis of their sexuality. We think that needs to be addressed and we think it needs to be addressed urgently.' </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor welcomed Mr Morrison's commitment and we hope that together we can resolve this matter, because Australians were shocked to learn that our young people could face discrimination in this way at school. It came to public attention only because parts of the government's religious freedom review expert panel report, which I think two Liberal Prime Ministers, Mr Turnbull and Mr Morrison, have sat on now for over six months, were leaked. The government refuses to release the report and allow a mature and informed debate on this issue. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The public response was overwhelming, and it reflects the outcome of the postal survey on marriage equality. Australians overwhelmingly support equality. Australians overwhelmingly support the removal of discrimination from our laws. That was reflected last year in the results of the postal survey. Labor is committed to removing these outdated exemptions and we welcome Mr Morrison's commitment to do the same.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">However, this is the situation we face: Centre Alliance Senators Griff and Patrick have made public that they will support the government's amendment to insert a new provision that exempts teaching activity in religious schools from the Sex Discrimination Act. The advice from legal experts is clear. This amendment, passed with the support of Senators Griff and Patrick, would destroy the intent of the bill—that is, to remove discrimination against LGBTIQ students. Worse still, the advice is that the government's amendment which would pass with the support of Centre Alliance would worsen discrimination against LGBTIQ students, allowing positive discrimination by staff and even allowing teachers to refuse to teach LGBTIQ students. Today LGBTIQ groups and the Human Rights Law Centre have made clear that, if this amendment were to succeed, the bill should be opposed. The opposition have worked to inform Centre Alliance's position. I want to express our disappointment that the consistent position of legal experts and stakeholders have not been able to convince Senators Griff and Patrick and Ms Sharkie of the impact of the amendments they support. It is disappointing that they have disengaged from negotiations notwithstanding the legal advice that has been provided to them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our position is clear. Labor's position is clear. We want to lessen discrimination, not increase it. We want to protect our kids, not exclude them from class. Labor will always fight for equality and we will continue to fight to remove discrimination against our kids.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="155410" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator RICE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:41</span>):  The Greens will also be supporting this change in the order of business, which very sadly means that we will not be considering debate and voting on a bill to remove discrimination. But the reason we support this change is that it has become apparent that the bill that was looking like it was going to pass through this Senate would not be a bill that would remove discrimination; it would be a bill that would increase the potential for discrimination against lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex and queer children. In fact, it would have the potential to increase discrimination on a whole range of other attributes that are covered under sex discrimination—on the basis of sex, pregnancy or breastfeeding. It actually was going to give religious schools the ability to discriminate on the basis of anything that was a teaching activity, which is any instruction in a school. So it would mean that a transgender child would not be able to wear the uniform of their choice. It would mean a transgender child could be instructed that they weren't allowed to use the toilet that was appropriate for them to use. It would mean that an instruction or direction would be able to be given that, 'You same-sex attracted children over here, we are going to teach you differently to those students over there.' It would have meant that very damaging instruction and so-called counselling would have been permitted, which is the sort of instruction that goes under the guise of conversion practices. That all would have been allowed under the guise of teaching activity done according to the religious beliefs of the school.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am so disappointed that this parliament has not been able to do something that should have been so simple and that the majority of the Australian community want to see happen. When the Ruddock review was leaked and the Australian community learnt that religious schools can discriminate against lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender kids, people were outraged. The opinion polls showed that 75 per cent of Australians said that schools should not be places where discrimination occurs, that LGBTI students should not be able to be discriminated against in schools and that LGBTI teachers should not be able to be discriminated against. The Australian community wants to see discrimination removed from our schools, and that's what I had hoped we would have been able to move on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister himself said six weeks ago now that it was urgent to remove discrimination in schools, and yet here we are, two days from the end of sitting, and the legislation that was looking like it was going to be moved through this parliament, because of amendments moved by the government and supported by the senators from Centre Alliance, would in fact not have removed discrimination in schools. It would have increased the potential for discrimination in schools. It is incredibly disappointing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that the Greens will continue to work with the LGBTI community. They are in absolute agreement, in their discussions this morning, in supporting us. If this legislation, with that government amendment, were what we were to be voting on today, they are in absolute agreement that the Greens should have been voting against it. So if that had been the case, we would have voted against it. I think it's a better outcome for the legislation not to be debated. Let's see if we can work through this. It's taking much longer than it should have. I know the vast majority of the Australian community want to see discrimination removed. They do not want to see lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender kids being discriminated against. We will get there eventually.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is just so disappointing that we are having to go through this awful process. Once again LGBTI people are having their lives talked about and are being used as items of political debate. It is sad. It is disappointing. But I know that we will pull together, we will pick up the pieces and keep going, and I know that we will remove discrimination. It's a year since we achieved marriage equality in this parliament—that wonderful achievement of this parliament of having marriage equality pass through this parliament. It will be another wonderful achievement when we change our antidiscrimination laws to remove discrimination against LGBTI students and teachers in schools, and I look forward to the day that that occurs.</span>

                  </a>  Thank you, Mr Acting Deputy President. We supported the motion last week to bring this on. We had a relatively simple bill that had been placed before the chamber. Late on Friday night, we received amendments from the government that were quite complex and we spent some time over the weekend trying to work through those. We got to Monday and we still didn't have a position. My colleague Senator Griff stood up and indicated that we would be abstaining because we weren't in a position to say yes or no to the government's amendments. We are obliged by our constituents to consider these amendments, so we sought to have it referred to committee as a method for making sure that the amendments were properly considered. In doing so, I was yelled at across the chamber. Senator Wong decided to scold me across the chamber for delaying something to try and get it right, and yet that's exactly what we are seeing happen here today. We are seeing Labor deciding to slow it down so that it can be properly considered.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the last 24 hours, one thing that has also arisen is the fact that there is a problem with the Labor Party's bill. This is what happens when you rush legislation. I understand the importance of this legislation, but when you rush things, you end up making mistakes. So it's regrettable that we're not going to proceed today, but it does give the opportunity for everyone to pause, reflect and consider the advice that is before them. I have seen Labor's advice. I've also seen advice from the contrary side of the argument. I have talked to students and teachers. I've talked to teachers of religious schools. I've talked to religious entities. We have listened to our constituents and we have landed in a position which we think is the right balance. We will vote according to our views and the views of our constituents.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I just want to make it very clear once again that we do not support any discrimination against students or teachers on the basis of sexual orientation or, indeed, gender identity. That is our clear position, but we also respect religious faith. There is a balance to be struck here, and we think we've found that balance. Of course, whenever we are approached by people who have contrary views, we will listen to them, but that's where we currently sit. It's unfortunate that this won't be put to a vote today. That's beyond our control; that's the way it is. It's unfortunate.</span>

                  </a>  To be absolutely clear, the Greens support withdrawing the sex discrimination amendment from today's order of business. We support pulling this bill because this bill, as amended by the government with the support of Centre Alliance, would entrench and increase discrimination rather than reduce it. I want to make this point very, very clear: we do support ensuring that we have legislation before this parliament that prevents schools from expelling students on the basis of their gender or sexuality—their gender identity or sexual orientation—but we also support legislation that would prevent teachers from being expelled or sacked on the basis of gender and sexual orientation. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But let me also say this in the time that I've got left: this motion seeks to ram through a long list of legislation without us being given the opportunity to give due consideration to each of these bills. We understand that some of these bills have been amended to, for example, give tax deductibility status—I'm looking at the Treasury laws amendment—to a whole range of organisations that we don't believe deserve that status. Yet, we now have an hour and a half to have a substantive debate on half a dozen bills that have not had the scrutiny that they deserve. So, while we support withdrawing the sex discrimination amendment, we don't support ramming through a long list of bills that haven't had the scrutiny that they deserve. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The work of the Australian Secret Intelligence Service (ASIS) is undertaken outside of public view.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">ASIS's operational successes are not heralded openly, and recognition of the individual achievements of the women and men who make up its ranks are necessarily discreet.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Nor is it possible to be completely candid about the circumstances in which those achievements come about, including the specific hazards officers have overcome in the course of their duties.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Nevertheless, it can be said much of ASIS's operational work overseas is necessarily conducted in hazardous environments, including in war-like zones and other high risk environments. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This reflects considerable change in the operating environments for ASIS officers since the original passage of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Intelligence Services Act</span> in 2001.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The original form of the Act limited the ability of ASIS officers to act even in their own self-defence, reflecting the findings of the Second Hope Royal Commission in 1984. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">By 2004, drawing on three years' practical experience immediately following the 9/11 attacks, and also drawing on ASIS's acknowledged role in direct support to the Australian Defence Force after 9/11, the Act was amended to allow ASIS officers, where authorised by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, to train in - and in certain circumstances use - weapons for self-defence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Since the time of those amendments, successive governments have asked ASIS to do more in response to national security priorities and unfolding events, and to do so in new places and new circumstances unforeseen in 2001 or in 2004. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In the fifteen years since the last amendment related to ASIS's use of force, the world has indisputably become even more complex—and Australia has become more of an international terrorism and espionage target.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">As a consequence, this Bill seeks to amend the <span style="font-style:italic;">Intelligence Services Act</span> to:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">enable ASIS to better protect its officers and other persons when operating in hazardous environments overseas, and</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">better protect Australia's national security interests, especially in counter-terrorism operations, overseas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Protection of Additional Persons</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The first amendment proposed would enable the Minister for Foreign Affairs to specify additional persons outside Australia who may be protected by an ASIS staff member or agent under Schedule 2 of the Act. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This would be at Ministerial discretion and could potentially include a range of individuals or categories of persons as appropriate to each context. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Currently, Schedule 2 permits the use of weapons by ASIS staff members or agents for self-defence, to defend other ASIS staff members or agents or persons cooperating with ASIS under Division 2 of the Act, or for training purposes. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The proposed amendment will mean that ASIS officers will be able to use weapons to protect a broader range of persons. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This will address a legal uncertainty identified by the Australian Government Solicitor (AGS) in the ability of an ASIS staff member to be compliant with the Act when defending certain other persons including bystanders, and to train for the use of force in those circumstances. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Use of Reasonable Force</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The second amendment proposed will enable the use of reasonable force by an ASIS staff member or agent in undertaking specified activities outside Australia in the proper performance of an ASIS function. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is important to note that this does not solely refer to the use of firearms. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This amendment will address several grey areas in the use of force under the Intelligence Services Act, particularly the use of reasonable and limited force to restrain, detain or move an individual who may pose a risk of the compromise of an operation, or where a staff member anticipates a possible safety risk.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The ability to use force will only apply where there is a significant risk to the safety of a person (this would likely, but would not necessarily need to be, an Australian person), or where there was a significant threat to security or significant risk to the operational security of ASIS.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This ability to use force where reasonably necessary for the performance of the specified activity will be a change for ASIS officers given that, as noted, their ability to use force is currently constrained to situations of self-defence. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Oversight</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Before directing a specified activity, the Minister for Foreign Affairs will have to consult with the Prime Minister, the Attorney-General, the Minister for Defence and other relevant Ministers. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Minister for Foreign Affairs would also need to be satisfied that arrangements are in place to ensure any actions taken by ASIS officers are necessary and reasonable, having regard to the purposes for which the direction is given.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is important to note that any use of force will be proportionate – it will be the minimum reasonable force given the circumstances. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">While lethal force may already be used in self-defence as a last resort to protect an officer or another protected person from serious harm or death, it is explicitly provided that in undertaking such an activity ASIS staff members or agents will not, and must not, engage in torture; cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment; sexual assault; or unlawful killings. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">An example of the use of force under these circumstances could include the keeping safe of an uncooperative person from a source of immediate danger during an ASIS operation, including by removing them from the source of immediate danger, even if they are in shock or paralysed with fear. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Like the existing ability to use weapons for self-defence, the amendments for the use of force will be a Ministerially authorised exception to the general prohibitions in ASIS activities against the use of violence against the person.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Oversight arrangements for these amendments will be critical, and will include key roles played by the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security (IGIS) and the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security (PJCIS). Importantly, the Inspector-General and her office were consulted in the development of this Bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Among other independent accountability and authorisation methods, the Inspector-General will need to be provided with copies of the ministerial approvals to undertake these specified activities and copies of ASIS's guidelines on the use of weapons and use of force. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Additionally, the Inspector-General, on receipt of the guidelines on the use of weapons and use of force, or changes to them, would be required to offer to brief the PJCIS on the content and the effect of the guidelines or the changes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This would be consistent with the remit of the PJCIS in matters of ASIS's administration and would provide a means for the committee to be satisfied that there are appropriate settings for the use of weapons and use of force.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Additional accountability</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">There is an additional accountability measure. The 2017 Independent Intelligence Review made a number of recommendations, including Recommendation 19: to delegate to the Director-General of ASIS certain authorisations, currently exercised by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in relation to the training of ASIS officers in the use of weapons, and the deployment of such weapons.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">If this Bill is passed, the conduct of a specified activity by ASIS or its agents would require that the Minister for Foreign Affairs consult with the Attorney-General before authorising such an activity, and this provides an additional opportunity for legal concerns to be raised, if any. The Minister for Foreign Affairs will also be required to consult with the Prime Minister and any other relevant Minister.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is perhaps unavoidable that having an intelligence agency whose core task is to undertake covert activities gives rise to myths and misconceptions about its activities and the rules under which it operates. This is despite the advent of the Intelligence Services Act itself, and its clear articulation of ASIS's functions and oversight arrangements.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is therefore important to articulate what these amendments do not allow – in addition to articulating what they do allow.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The first such misunderstanding may be a confusion between ASIS's modern mandate and authorisations, compared to ASIS's pre-1984 'Special Operations' function, which was ended after a recommendation of the Second Hope Royal Commission.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">These proposed modern measures are in no way the same as ASIS's pre-1984 role: there is no need for ASIS to conduct special operations. Australia has an existing Special Forces capability within the Australian Defence Force.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">While the amendments are directed towards self-defence, it is possible that some members of the public may equate this with para-military offensive action. Nothing could be further from reality. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The amendments allow this self-defence provision to be extended to those not directly part of an ASIS operational team, such as hostages being rescued, or bystanders who need to be kept safe from a source of immediate danger. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">ASIS has trained and deployed with weapons in certain situations since 2004. But, as noted at the beginning of this speech, challenges to Australia's national security require ASIS to more frequently operate in hazardous circumstances overseas – especially against increasingly sophisticated and ruthless armed terrorist groups.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The current provisions of the Act are leading to unintended and unsafe situations for ASIS officers, and others. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">For example, under the current Act, an armed ASIS officer undertaking an operation overseas may only use a weapon in defence of another officer, agent or a limited category of person co-operating with ASIS. The Act currently prohibits an ASIS officer from using a weapon in defence of an innocent person who is threatened by a terrorist or kidnapper, even where this threat is present in front of the ASIS officer. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The proposed amendments will allow an ASIS officer confronted with this situation to act appropriately in defence of the innocent person.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Nevertheless, these amendments do not affect the existing prohibition in Section 6(4) of the Act that prevents ASIS officers from planning or undertaking paramilitary activities. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">To conclude, each day the women and men of ASIS go about their work to protect and advance the Australian national interest. They are often called upon to do so covertly, at considerable personal risk and hazard, and in environments of significant danger. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="I0N" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator FARRELL</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:54</span>):  I rise to speak on the Intelligence Services Amendment Bill 2018 on behalf of the opposition. I would like to say at the outset that Labor supports this bill. We support this bill because we recognise the need to modernise the legislative framework that governs the Australian Secret Intelligence Services, ASIS, to reflect the changing operational realities of the global environment and the nature of Australia's current national security challenges.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">First, some background is helpful to contextualise the proposed amendments that the Intelligence Services Amendment Bill 2018 makes to the existing legal framework. The Intelligence Services Act has an explicit limitation that, in performing its functions, ASIS must not plan or undertake activities that involve paramilitary activities, violence against the person or the use of weapons. In 2004, parliament amended the Intelligence Services Act to permit ASIS staff members and agents to undertake training in, and to engage in the use of self-defence techniques and weapons for the purpose of protection when undertaking activities outside Australia. This is subject to ministerial approval.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The nature of the protection that an ASIS agent or staff member can be trained to engage is in interpreted consistently with common law principles of self-defence—in other words, a minimum force reasonably necessary in the circumstances as the staff member or agent perceives that it is required to protect life or to prevent serious injury to themselves or to another person. However, currently there are strict limitations on who may be protected by an ASIS staff member or agent acting in self-defence. The scope is limited to the individual ASIS member or agent themselves, other members or agents of ASIS or a person from another approved authority who is cooperating with ASIS. This is a narrower scope than those who may otherwise be protected by any other Australian person acting under the common law of self-defence. This means that, should an ASIS staff member or agent engage in the use of a weapon or self-defence technique to protect persons who are not within the limited scope defined by the legislation, their action may actually be permitted in accordance with common law, but they would be in breach of the Intelligence Services Act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill would amend the Intelligence Services Act to: firstly, enable the minister to specify additional persons outside Australia who may be protected by an ASIS staff member or agent; and, secondly, provide that an ASIS staff member or agent performing specific activities outside Australia will be able to use reasonable and necessary force in the performance of an ASIS function. Additional persons could include officers from other agencies such as officers from a state or Commonwealth agency and from approved foreign agencies, hostages and other bystanders.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments are also intended to address another current legal uncertainty as to whether the existing provisions that enable the use of a weapon or self-defence technique for protection also extend to the ability to apply pre-emptive force or threats of force to restrain, control or compel a person in a situation where the ASIS member or agent feels that, if they do not do so, the situation is likely to escalate to a situation where greater force is required. This use of pre-emptive force in this context would be limited to what could constitute reasonable and necessary force but could not result in physical harm or injury to the person that might exceed the threshold of actual bodily harm under Australian law.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Crucially, the proposed extended powers available to ASIS staff and agents to use weapons, self-defence techniques and reasonable force will be subject to appropriate oversight. Specifically, ministerial approval is required for an ASIS officer or agent to be provided with a weapon, to be provided with training in the use of force and to use force for the purposes of or in the course of specified activities. The minister must not give approval unless they have also consulted with the Prime Minister, the Attorney-General, the defence minister and any other minister who has responsibility for a matter that is likely to be significantly affected by an act that is to be approved. Approval must be provided in writing to the Director-General of ASIS and must specify any conditions that must be complied with and, if approved, the kind or class of weapon involved. In addition, the Director-General of ASIS must give a report to the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security, the IGIS, if a weapon or self-defence technique is used by an ASIS staff member or agent. The report must be given in writing as soon as practicable after the weapon or self-defence technique is used, and explain the circumstances under which the use occurred.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also includes a new oversight mechanism whereby the IGIS must brief the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security regarding the content and effect of ASIS guidelines on matters related to the use of weapons and self-defence techniques if requested by the committee or if the guidelines change. This is intended to provide an additional layer of external scrutiny to the content and scope of guidance to ASIS staff members and agents in order to ensure that such rules governing the use of force remain appropriate.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill was introduced to the House of Representatives and then referred to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security for inquiry and report. Following inquiry, the committee was satisfied with the provisions contained in the bill and recommended that the Intelligence Services Amendment Bill 2018 be passed. Labor appreciates the non-partisan and consultative manner in which this bill has been dealt with, and the respect for the parliament and the importance of adequate oversight requirements. This should provide confidence to the parliament and to the public in regard to the additional powers conferred by this bill. Such an approach is an example of how national security legislation should be pursued. I recommend the bill to the Senate.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill will improve and modernise the legislative framework that governs the use of force by the Australian Secret Intelligence Service (ASIS) to address key operational challenges and issues. The Bill will do this by amending the Intelligence Services Act 2001 (IS Act) to:</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <span class="HPS-Small">b. provide that an ASIS staff member or agent performing specified activities outside Australia will be able to use reasonable and necessary force in the performance of an ASIS function.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In short, additional persons or classes of persons will be permitted to use weapons, and ASIS staff members and agents will be permitted to use force, including the use of a weapon, against persons outside Australia.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's fair to say that ASIS has a pretty chequered history when it comes to the use of weapons. The legislative framework governing ASIS's use of weapons was changed significantly in response to a recommendation of the Royal Commission on Australia's Security and Intelligence Agencies following what became known as the Sheraton Hotel incident, which took place in November 1983.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's worth reminding ourselves of the circumstances of that incident. I'm relying here on a paper entitled <span style="font-style:italic;">Wayward governance: illegality and its control in the public sector</span>, published by the Australian Institute of Criminology. In that paper the AIC wrote, in relation to the Sheraton Hotel incident, that, in that incident, staff of the hotel were confronted at a lift by a group of men:</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Some were wearing masks, some were carrying weapons, ranging from Browning 9 mm automatic pistols to the formidable Heckler and Koch submachine gun. The intruders moved through the lobby into the kitchen, menacing the kitchen staff on the way, and departed in two getaway cars waiting outside a kitchen exit. One of the cars was stopped by … Victoria Police a short distance from the hotel and its occupants were taken into custody. … Hotel staff may have assumed that they were the victims of an armed robbery; in fact they were unwilling parties to … a resoundingly unsuccessful training exercise by officers of the … Australian Secret Intelligence Service (ASIS).</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The royal commission recommended that the use of weapons by ASIS be terminated and that ASIS's stocks of weapons, including explosives, be disposed of. The government of the time accepted and acted on those recommendations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have a personal recollection of this event, and I would imagine that many of the senators of my age—ranging from slightly younger to quite a bit older—in this place would also have a personal recollection of this event. It does call into memory some of the other shambolic so-called training exercises that have been held in Australia by our security and intelligence services, including one that was ultimately truncated on the streets of Melbourne a few years ago by the Australian Border Force. That particular event, the Sheraton Hotel incident, which took place in November 1983, did result in a significant change to the legislative framework regarding ASIS's use of weapons and the stocks of weapons that ASIS could maintain. It's also worth noting that, since then, in 2004 an amendment enabled ASIS staff members and agents to be trained in and equipped with weapons and techniques for the purposes of self-defence and the defence of fellow officers and others cooperating with ASIS under authorisation of the Minister for Home Affairs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's where the framework sits at the moment. ASIS agents and staff members can be trained in self-defence techniques and equipped with weapons for the purposes of self-defence and the defence of fellow officers and other people cooperating with ASIS. This amendment continues the mission creep that we so often see in this place. Again, it would, in effect, lower the threshold from where it currently sits with regard to self-defence and change that threshold by providing that an ASIS staff member or agent preforming specified activities outside Australia will be able to use reasonable and necessary force in the performance of an ASIS function. That's a significant lowering of the threshold that is being presented to us today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's been argued by the government that this is a minor increase in powers which is both necessary and proportionate, but, in the view of the Australian Greens, this is mission creep. This legislation joins the many hundreds of pieces of legislation that we've seen passed through state, territory and Commonwealth parliaments in the last 20 years that provide greater powers to our intelligence services and erode fundamental rights, freedoms and liberties in this place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to say again that Australia is the only liberal democracy in the world that does not have some form of charter or bill of rights either constitutionally or legislatively enshrined. It's a matter that absolutely needs to be addressed by this parliament, and I remind members that the Greens have a motion that will be coming on later today to provide for a Legal and Constitutional Affairs References Committee inquiry into the form and function of a legislated charter of rights in this country. We urgently need a charter of rights in Australia because the LNP and the ALP, in zombie policy lock step, are sleepwalking Australia down the dangerous path to a police state.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We will see legislation that is far more significant than this come before the Senate in the next 36 hours or so, when there will be amendments around powers that intelligence agencies have in regard to backdoor entry to encrypted apps. That legislation will contain other, particularly disturbing, provisions, including a provision that some intelligence agencies may be able to remotely access the computer of anybody in this country for specific purposes in specific circumstances without the knowledge of the person whose computer it is and in some cases without a warrant. Disturbingly, the legislation provides that, even if on retrospective application a judicial authority or the AAT makes a determination that in fact a warrant should have been sought—that is, that the remote covert access to anyone's computer was made unlawfully—the intelligence agencies can actually keep the information that they unlawfully accessed from a private citizen's computer and use that information in their investigations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are seeing an erosion of fundamental rights and freedoms. It is not just civil and political freedoms, although those are being eroded in this country, and there is quite rightly significant concern about that, but other freedoms and rights, such as the right to privacy. This is all being done in the name of counterterrorism, and it's being done in deals stitched up behind the closed doors of the Joint Standing Committee on Intelligence and Security between the ALP and the LNP. I want to say how disappointing it is that the ALP has crumbled into a pathetic heap in regard to the encryption legislation.</span>

We are seeing again the zombie policy of the ALP and the LNP as they get together in lock step and erode fundamental rights and freedoms that they, particularly the Australian Labor Party, used to stand for in this place many years ago.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On the legislation that is currently before us, it's probably worth pointing out that ASIS managed to illegally bug the Timor-Leste government in order to defraud Timor-Leste out of hundreds of millions of dollars of revenue from the Timor oil and gas fields that were rightly Timor-Leste's. It was defrauded out of those revenues—unlawfully—by the Australian government through ASIS's bugging of the Timor-Leste government deliberations on that matter. ASIS managed to do that quite successfully without an increase in their powers relating to how and in what circumstances they can use their weapons. That was one of the most shameful acts of any intelligence agency in our country's history—ripping off one of our impoverished neighbours of many hundreds of millions of dollars, at a minimum, that that country could have used to help lift its people out of poverty and provide essential medical and educational services to its people. That money was effectively stolen by the Commonwealth government, because they unlawfully bugged the cabinet deliberations of Timor-Leste and used the information they gathered through that unlawful bugging to, effectively, steal money from Timor-Leste. It is a shameful and highly embarrassing chapter in our country's history, and one which will continue to be spoken about in this place as the shameful trial of Mr Bernard Collaery and Witness K continues in the ACT legal system. I, for one, and I know colleagues Senator Patrick, Senator Storer and Mr Wilkie from the other place will continue to keep as close an eye as possible and continue to speak about it in this place, because that prosecution never should have been authorised by the Attorney-General in the first place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, when we hear assurances that additional powers given to our intelligence agencies will not be used in unintended ways, which is an assurance the government is trying to give us with regard to this legislation, I want to refer people back to metadata laws, again shamefully supported by the ALP and the LNP in their zombie policy lockstep and their slow sleepwalking into authoritarianism and a police state in this country. When those metadata laws were put before this parliament, the entire debate was framed by both of the major parties in this place as being about counterterrorism and national security. I invite the people who made those claims to go have a look at various reports from various agencies which actually disclose how access to metadata has occurred and why access to metadata has occurred. I refer them to the case of a local council in Queensland who accessed somebody's metadata in an attempt to find out whether they had an unregistered pet. That's the kind of mission creep that we're dealing with here, and history is replete with examples of laws being passed on a particular basis and then government authorities or agencies using those laws for something that was not contemplated by the policymakers at the time or at least not admitted to being contemplated by the policymakers at the time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, it is mission creep. For readers of history, you should know that, when you give extra powers to intelligence agencies and allow those powers to be utilised by other government authorities, what we will see is mission creep and those powers being used for purposes that were not contemplated at the time that the powers were granted by this parliament. So we have very little faith when we hear assurances that additional powers will not be used in unintended ways, and that is the case also with this legislation.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="M56" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator PAYNE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Foreign Affairs</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:17</span>):  I will make a few summing up observations on the Intelligence Services Amendment Bill 2018. I thank senators for their contributions to the debate. The work of the Australian Secret Intelligence Service is necessarily undertaken largely away from public view. Nevertheless, I can say in this place that much of ASIS's operational work overseas is necessarily conducted in hazardous environments, including in warlike zones and other high-risk environments. There has been considerable change in the environments where ASIS officers are deployed, and the risks—the threats—have increased greatly since the original package of the Intelligence Services Act in 2001.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The original form of the act limited the ability of ASIS officers to act even in their own self-defence, but by 2004, drawing on practical experience after the attacks of 9/11, the act was amended to allow ASIS officers, where authorised by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, to use weapons for self-defence in narrowly defined circumstances. Since the time of those amendments, successive governments have asked ASIS to do more in response to changing national security priorities and to unfolding events and to do so in new places and in circumstances unforeseen in 2001 or even in 2004. Fifteen years later, the government is of the view that it is time to amend the act to allow ASIS to more safely operate in a far more complex and dangerous world. This bill seeks to amend the Intelligence Services Act to enable ASIS to better protect its officers and other persons, when operating in hazardous environments overseas, through the defined use of force and to protect Australia's national security interests, especially in counterterrorism operations overseas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There will be additional oversight mechanisms that come with these new and additional powers to use force under clearly defined conditions. The Minister for Foreign Affairs will need to be satisfied that arrangements are in place to ensure any actions taken by ASIS officers are both necessary and reasonable, having regard to the purposes for which the direction is given. While lethal force may already be used in self-defence as a last resort to protect an officer or another protected person from serious harm or death, it is explicitly provided that in undertaking such an activity ASIS staff members or agents will not, and must not, engage in torture, cruel, inhumane or degrading treatment, sexual assault or unlawful killings.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments before the Senate underline the continuing importance of the role of the Minister for Foreign Affairs in authorising the use of weapons by ASIS. If this bill is passed, the conduct of a specified activity by ASIS or its agents would require the Minister for Foreign Affairs to consult with the Prime Minister and certain other ministers before authorising such an activity. If this is enacted, the independent Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security will oversee compliance with the bill to ensure that ASIS's conduct is consistent with the law and with the Australian public's expectations of propriety.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note the contributions of both Senators Farrell and McKim on the bill. I thank Senator Farrell for his contribution. In relation to the observations made by Senator McKim: I note that, in an approach typical of the Australian Greens to protecting Australia's national security, Senator McKim has engaged in a spray about issues that are of concern to the Greens and which don't appear to include Australia's national security as such. In referring to the bill itself as 'mission creep', Senator McKim conveniently ignores all of the protections which I've just spoken about—the oversight mechanisms which I've just referred to, which are part of the bill and which Senator Farrell has already referred to in his remarks. Senator McKim ignored all of that, but that is unsurprising coming from the Australian Greens.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is pertinent also to refer to the senator's observations in relation to the Hope royal commission and measures which came out of that. It is important to note that these measures are not the same and that the circumstances are most certainly different. I think it is most unfair, in fact, to characterise this particular bill as mission creep, given the great deal of consideration that has gone into its development and given the effluxion of time, indeed, since the last time the act itself was amended in this context.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is now in Australia no need for ASIS to be in a role of undertaking special operations. Of course, we have an existing special operations capability as part of the ADF. As I noted in my remarks when the last amendments were made on these matters in 2004, ASIS has trained and deployed with weapons in certain situations since that time. But there have been challenges and changes to Australia's national security circumstances which, as I said in my opening statement, require ASIS to operate increasingly in hazardous circumstances overseas, especially when operating against terrorists, violent extremists and other threats.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The current provisions of the Intelligence Services Act are leading to absurd situations which would make little sense to the public. For example, we might see armed ASIS officers undertaking an operation overseas being prohibited by the current act from using weapons in defence of an innocent person other than another officer, an agent or a limited category of cooperating person who might be threatened by a terrorist or a kidnapper, even where this is occurring right in front of them. This includes both Australian and foreign national hostages. These amendments don't affect the prohibitions in section 6(4) of the Intelligence Services Act which, of course, prevent ASIS officers from planning or undertaking military activities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A great deal of consultation has gone into this bill to ensure that it is transparent and that it is the most effective bill possible. The amendments, as I said, are not proposed lightly, nor are they excessive, nor are they an overreach. We believe in them, and the government supports them, because they are balanced, they are proportionate and, fundamentally, they are necessary.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To conclude, every day the women and the men of ASIS go about their work in protecting and advancing Australia's national interests. They are often called upon to do so covertly at considerable personal risk and hazard and in environments of significant danger, and I want to acknowledge them and their work. As the world has become more complex, it's clear that the legislation that governs ASIS operations also needs to evolve so that staff members and the agents who assist them have the appropriate capacity for self-defence as authorised by the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I commend the bill to the Senate.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:27</span>):  I rise to speak on the Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme Legislation Amendment Bill 2018. This bill is an amendment to the Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme Act 2018, the FITS Act; and the National Security Legislation Amendment (Espionage and Foreign Interference) Act 2018, otherwise known as the EFI Act, which both passed through the parliament in June of 2018. The FITS Act creates a registration scheme for persons undertaking certain activities on behalf of foreign governments, for foreign government related entities, foreign political organisations and foreign government related individuals. The EFI Act, which deals with overlapping subject matter, stipulates that persons who have existing arrangements, once the scheme commences, have a six-month grace period before they are expected to comply.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has announced that the registration scheme is due to come into effect on 10 December this year. The Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme Act 2018 makes two major changes to these existing arrangements. It amends the EFI Act to shorten the grace period for compliance for those parties with existing arrangements from six months to three months. It also stipulates that, if writs for a federal election are issued within that three-month period, parties will only have 14 days to comply. It amends the FITS Act to stipulate that past registrations will still be available publicly and searchable on the internet, not just current registrations. Without this change, past affiliations or arrangements with foreign political organisations or foreign government related individuals will disappear from public view once they expire.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The first change is designed to account for the expected timing of an upcoming federal election—whenever that may be. With the scheme coming into effect on 10 December 2018, if the six-month grace period were not shortened, registration obligations would not come into effect until June 2019, after the election. With the proposed change they would come into effect in March 2019. The second change appears to be an oversight by the government in the original bill, which is, of course, regrettable. It's clearly in the public interest for past associations with foreign political organisations or foreign government related entities to be on the public record.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These amendments should perhaps be a sign to the government that taking the time to make good law, when it comes to national security, is a good thing—a lesson that, apparently, they have not learned. Though not ideal, the committee process for both the Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme Bill and the National Security Legislation Amendment (Espionage and Foreign Interference) Bill was cooperative and productive. The committee report on the latter bill contained more than 60 recommendations—the most relating to any bill that has ever been before that committee. It shows you, perhaps, the magnitude and the difficulty of the work that this committee does on a regular basis.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor supports this bill, as it is an extension of support for the original bill. We supported the original Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme Act 2018 and the National Security Legislation Amendment (Espionage and Foreign Interference) Act 2018 on the basis that foreign interference in our political system, if it is malign, is unacceptable, and, even if it's benign, it should nevertheless be transparent. Both changes are technical rather than substantive. While we regret that these matters were not dealt with in the original legislation, we support those amendments now.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:31</span>):  I rise to speak on the Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme Legislation Amendment Bill 2018, which the Greens will be supporting. The main effect of this bill will be to expand the scope of the information to be made publicly available with regard to those registered under the Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme Act registration scheme. The bill will also reduce the grace period for registration by those with registerable arrangements at the commencement of the Foreign Influence Transparency Scheme Act—which is 10 December 2018—from six months to the earlier of three months from commencement or 14 days from the issue of election writs. The Attorney-General, in his second reading speech on this bill, stated that the six-month grace period currently granted under the NSLA act effectively excuses certain people who will be liable to register once the FITS Act commences from having to do so before the next federal election if it takes place in the first half of 2019, which you would think is just about a certainty as we stand here today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Greens do have concerns about foreign influence, and, if you want to understand the impacts of foreign influences on some of our world's largest and most important democracies, senators need look no further than the Brexit vote in the UK and the election of Donald Trump as the President of the United States. In both of those votes, there was significant foreign influence, and, in both of those cases, the foreign influence included, but was probably not limited to, the state of Russia. We hold grave concerns about foreign influence in Australia's democracy. There have been repeated warnings from security agencies such as ASIO of attempts by foreign governments to influence our democracy. Certainly, one foreign government that we hold significant concerns about—a government which has attempted, and is undoubtedly attempting, to influence our democracy—is the government of China, with which both the LNP and the ALP have very close ties. Those ties are to the detriment of the independence of our democracy. So we will be supporting this bill because, even though the measures contained in it are quite small steps, we believe they do step us down the road towards a more robust protection of our democracy from interference and influence by foreign governments.</span>

It was always intended that historical information about persons registered under the FITS Act should continue to be published after their registration ceases. The bill will ensure that this will occur. It was also always intended that the FITS Act scheme would be fully operational in time for the next election. This bill will make sure of this.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator POLLEY</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:36</span>):  This bill, the Family Law Amendment (Family Violence and Cross-examination of Parties) Bill, reflects a change to the Family Law Act which Labor has been calling on the government to make for some time. It's hard to believe that in 2018 family-violence survivors are still sometimes required to endure cross-examination conducted by their own abusers. It seems unthinkable, but it happens. According to an Australian Institute of Family Studies report published in June 2018, 173 survivors were directly cross-examined by their abusers in family law matters over the course of two years. But that number likely disguises the much larger number of women who, faced with the possibility of direct cross-examination, choose to settle in order to avoid it, often with suboptimal outcomes. It's hard to put into words how horrific an experience it must be, to have the person who has inflicted hurt and pain on you question you in front of others about that very experience. It is a tool perpetrators can and have used to inflict fresh pain and trauma on survivors. It should have stopped a long time ago. It's an outrage that it continues.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Before the 2016 election, Labor pledged to change the law so that this horrible practice stops happening. We also pledged $43 million in funding for Legal Aid, over four years, to provide legal representations during hearings to prevent direct cross-examination from being necessary. Our party leader committed Labor to that policy on White Ribbon Day in November that same year. It was then and it is now an initiative I am very proud of. It was something that needed to happen. As the member for Maribyrnong said in his speech two years ago:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This is trial by ordeal. It is an added indignity, a further injustice, inflicted by the abuser who has already done enough damage. Cross-examination in family violence by unrepresented perpetrators is a re-injury. It is new harm on top of the old …</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And we can put a stop to it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's policy would have compelled judges to first consider whether appropriate protection should be put in place during cross-examination of domestic violence survivors and, if available mechanisms were insufficient, to impose a ban. Labor has led the debate on this issue, and thankfully, finally, the government has followed. The government has produced this bill, the Family Law Amendment (Family Violence and Cross-examination of Parties) Bill, which imposes an automatic ban on direct cross-examination of family violence survivors by their perpetrators. This automatic ban applies where there is evidence or allegations of family violence between the two parties in a family law matter.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The ban will automatically be imposed if certain conditions are met. If there is an allegation of family violence between the two parties and either party has been convicted of or charged with an offence involving violence or threat of violence to the other party, then the automatic ban will apply. Similarly, if a family violence order applies to both parties or if an injunction is in place for the personal protection of either party, the automatic ban will apply. Of course, there could still be serious family violence in play, even if none of those conditions are met. In that case, the court still has the discretion to impose a ban if it is deemed appropriate, and, if a ban is not imposed, the court will be required to apply other protections for the victim such as video link or screens during cross-examination.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In cases where the ban is imposed, unrepresented parties will be directed by a judge to obtain representation either through Legal Aid or through private funding. This includes both survivor and perpetrator. If either party cannot obtain or refuses to obtain legal representation, no cross-examination can take place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill was put through the House ahead of any funding for Legal Aid being announced, which Labor objected to on the basis that it was premature. However, we are pleased to hear that a deal has in fact been struck with Legal Aid of $7 million over three years, commencing 1 July next year. Although this is substantially smaller than Labor's commitment, and Labor remains sceptical that the amount will be sufficient, we accept that National Legal Aid has expressed satisfaction with this amount. We continue to believe, for instance, that the current numbers of instances of victims facing cross-examination by their abuser are an underestimation, given many women are likely to choose to settle rather than face such an ordeal.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a two-year review written into this legislation, which will be a welcome test of the adequacy of this funding. Should that review show that $7 million over three years does not stretch far enough, the government of the day must commit to addressing this shortfall. It is well known that Legal Aid services across the country are stretched to their absolute limit. National funding levels are forecast to increase less than five per cent in the four years from 2014-15 to 2019-20. This is barely enough to keep up with demand.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Wherever I go around the country, I always make an effort to visit Legal Aid commissions and community legal centres and let them tell me of the issues that they're facing. Let me tell you, there is nothing left in the tank. That's what I get told, and I hear that regularly. National Legal Aid gave evidence at the inquiry into this bill. They said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">If new funding is not made available to support the scheme, legal aid commissions would be unable to provide legal representation outside existing legal aid funding.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Legal Aid commissions operate within an already stretched funding regime and strict guidelines that prioritise those in our community who are the most vulnerable and in need of assistance. In August, the opposition leader and deputy leader wrote to the Prime Minister urging him to step in and act on the funding that is missing from the bill that we are currently debating. I will read a few lines from that letter:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… as a matter of urgency, we are asking you and the Attorney-General to provide a guarantee of funding before this bill is put to the Senate for a vote.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This is fundamental to making the reform worthwhile.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We have often attended events together where we've both spoken of the need for parliament to do more to eliminate the scourge of family violence from our national life and to deliver better services and resources for survivors and their families.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It's a policy area we all care deeply about.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">By allocating a small sum of money alongside an overdue reform, we have the opportunity to make a difference as soon as parliament resumes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">So let's get it done.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Protecting victims of family violence is not a second-order matter for this parliament; it is one of the most important things. With this bill today, although it has taken far too long, we are a step closer. I commend the bill.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="JKM" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McKIM</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:45</span>):  I rise to speak on the Family Law Amendment (Family Violence and Cross-examination of Parties) Bill 2018. This bill amends the Family Law Act 1975 to provide protections for victims of family violence during cross-examination in family law proceedings.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Direct cross-examination is where one party asks questions of a witness directly, rather than having questions asked by a lawyer. These circumstances usually occur where one of the parties is self-represented. In this particular context, one of those circumstances could be the cross-examination of family violence survivors by people who are alleged to have been their abusers. There is no doubt that that has the capacity to inflict significant extra pain and trauma on survivors of family violence and to reopen wounds that may have been healing over.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So it is important that legislative provisions in this country do everything that they can to protect survivors of family violence from further and, particularly, unnecessary extra pain and trauma. But it is also important that we get the balance right and do everything we can to provide procedural fairness for everyone who is caught up in our legal system, including our Family Court system. This bill proposes a ban on cross-examination in certain circumstances, on direct cross-examination, and that when that ban applies, cross-examination must be conducted by a legal representative.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The question of how this legal representation will work has been the subject of some concern in submissions to the Senate inquiry into the bill. We have seen submissions from various groups and organisations which have expressed some concerns about the balance struck in this bill. I want to refer senators particularly to the submission from the Law Council of Australia, where they observed that proceedings involving direct cross-examinations between perpetrators and victims at trial, whilst raising significant concerns, are of limited number in the family law system. Their submission also noted that there are already significant legislative tools to prevent victims from improper exposure. The Law Council also explained that the right to cross-examine another party is an essential part of any adversarial system of justice, and for that reason it had concerns about the removal of that right.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Law Council also submitted concerns around what it regarded as the lack of clarity regarding the proposed model for participation of a lawyer to perform the cross-examination; the failure by government to confirm that extra funding would be provided to legal aid commissions to enable them to perform this vital role of cross-examination; the lack of clarity regarding the guidelines that would be applied by legal aid commissions to people who cannot afford a private lawyer and who seek the appointment of a legal aid lawyer; and the uncertainty about what is to occur if a party cannot afford a private lawyer and is not eligible for legal aid. I think it would be reasonable to expect the government to respond to those concerns.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has acknowledged the issue of extra funding for legal aid commissions, and that is absolutely critical to ensuring that this legislation actually works on the ground in our family law system. The Australian Greens share the scepticism outlined by Senator Polley, the previous speaker, that the government's commitments to date are enough to ensure that this system is going to work well, properly and fairly for all parties concerned. We urge the government to revisit its current level of commitments to ensure that, in fact, the money is there for legal aid commissions to provide this essential service to ensure that the interests of all parties in our family law system are delivered.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Importantly, parties will be able to engage their own legal representation. It is where a party is unable to obtain private legal representation that they will be able to seek representation through legal aid commissions. I would be particularly interested, Minister Reynolds, in a response from you about the circumstance where someone is ineligible to receive legal assistance from Legal Aid and yet maintains a lack of capacity to employ their own counsel, and whether that matter may be addressed in the guidelines that we hope will be developed by legal aid commissions in this area. It's worth pointing out that the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights reported that it considers that the bill does not raise human rights concerns.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also support the two-year review that is included in this legislation. When something like this, which does fundamentally change the way some cases will be dealt with by our family law system, is initiated, it is important that, after an appropriate period, a review is conducted to ensure that the legislation is delivering as intended and that there have not been unintended consequences such as, for example, a reduction in procedural fairness in our Family Court system. In regard to funding increases for legal aid, I can't let the opportunity go by without once again placing on the record, on behalf of the Australian Greens, our community legal sector and the important role that it plays in the provision of legal assistance to so many Australian people and organisations. I urge the government to more adequately fund that sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Although this is undoubtedly a difficult issue, and one where we need to do everything we can to ensure that an acceptable balance is reached between protecting the rights of those who have suffered family violence and ensuring that procedural fairness is maintained in Family Court proceedings to the greatest degree possible, we will support this bill through the Senate today.</span>

It simply points out yet again that the Liberal and National parties are the parties that don't just talk about the social issues, that don't just talk about victims' rights, particularly for women in these situations, but actually do something about them and introduce legislation to deal with pressing issues. I'm pleased to say that in this instance the government's approach has been followed and adopted by both the Australian Labor Party and the Greens political party. As I mentioned, as a result of that, the committee's report was unanimous.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do want to thank all of those many people who made very detailed submissions to the committee and those who attended before the committee's public hearing to give evidence. Can I at this time, as we approach Christmas, particularly mention the staff of the secretariat—Dr Sean Turner, Mr Nicholas Craft, Ms Ophelia Tynan, Ms Alexandria Moore and Ms Kate Morris—who did a wonderful job on this report, as usual. I thank publicly the committee secretariat for the work they do throughout the year. My committee seems to get its fair share of work through a number of bills relating to legal and constitutional matters, which means the committee secretariat is always at full speed in dealing with these things. In this instance, as in the case of all committee reports, the committee has done a wonderful job encapsulating many of the important points made by those who submitted in writing and those who gave evidence, and the views of individual senators who constitute part of the committee.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Very briefly, the committee recognises that there exists a significant problem in relation to direct cross-examination of parties in cases where allegations of family violence have been raised. In particular, the committee is alert to the fact that retraumatisation can occur as a result of a victim being cross-examined by the perpetrator. The committee welcomed the bill's attempts to address this situation and prevent further harm to those experiencing family violence. The committee also notes that the intent of the bill was widely supported in the evidence tendered to the inquiry. The committee noted, as Senator McKim also noted, that a critical tension emerged in the evidence—that is, that a balance had to be maintained between procedural fairness and the protection of parties who've been affected by family violence and who've experienced family violence. After carefully considering the evidence presented to the committee in relation to these matters, the committee came to the conclusion that the bill did provide the correct balance that was required.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">During all of the committee's inquiry and in the evidence, concerns regarding funding of the bill's proposed measures were a consistent theme throughout the evidence provided. Basically, the bill requires that for people in these situations—where a perpetrator wants to cross-examine them—the rules should be that legal advice is provided so that this doesn't happen. The committee further acknowledged the evidence given that related to litigants who might not qualify for legal assistance and who cannot afford private legal representation. Evidence gathered by the committee suggested that this group of people may be significantly impacted by the bills proposed measures. Again, the committee notes the advice provided by the Attorney-General's Department that the issue is currently being considered. I note the Labor Party tried to make some political capital of this by suggesting that Mr Shorten had written to the Attorney, but Mr Shorten's letter was after the committee had reported and published its recommendation along the same line.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm delighted that the committee's first recommendation was that details regarding funding of the measures contained in the bill needed to be made public prior to the commencement of the date of the bill and that that needed to be provided to the Senate. I'm delighted that on 20 November this year Ms O'Dwyer, on behalf of the government, in releasing the women's economic safety package, specifically provided that $7 million would be provided over three years ongoing, commencing from 1 July next year, to ensure that the provisions of this bill are able to be met and that the legal aid is properly funded to do the duty it's required to do under this bill. Those measures in the bill will be reviewed after the two-year period.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I conclude by thanking all of those involved—my colleagues in the Senate, the submitters and particularly the secretariat. I emphasise again my congratulations to the government and the Attorney-General for dealing with this issue which has been around for a long period of time. Minister, my congratulations to you and to the minister whom you represent here for actually doing the work—not just talking about it, not just wringing your hands with regret at what was happening but taking practical measures to support it. I again emphasise that the committee's report was unanimous. I thank the Labor Party and the Greens political party for supporting the committee's recommendations and thank the government for acceding to recommendation 1, regarding legal aid.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Small and Family Business, Skills and Vocational Education</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:02</span>):  I rise to sum up the debate on the Family Law Amendment (Family Violence and Cross-examination of Parties) Bill 2018. I thank all senators for their contributions to the debate on this bill and for their support of this very, very important measure. Before I go into the summing up debate, I understand, Senator McKim, that you had asked a question. I now do have the response to that question. I understand it was in relation to legal aid funding. I am advised that legal representation under the scheme will be available to all parties, subject to the ban on direct cross-examination. Legal aid commissions' usual means and merits tests will not apply. I hope that answers.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator CASH:</span>
                    </a>  Excellent; thank you very much.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">During debate in the House of Representatives the Attorney-General confirmed that the government will ensure adequate funding is provided to legal aid for representation of those affected by the bill. On 20 November 2018, the government announced ongoing funding, initially of $7 million over three years, to establish the new Family Violence and Cross-examination of Parties Scheme. Legal representation under the scheme will be available to all parties, as I've just said to Senator McKim, subject to the ban on direct cross-examination in the bill. The usual legal aid means and merits tests will not apply. Parties may be required to contribute to the cost of their legal representation under the scheme based on their ability to pay, their circumstances and the cost of the matter. The government has worked extensively with National Legal Aid to accurately cost this measure and ensure that the scheme is fully funded.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has relied on the Australian Institute of Family Studies research it commissioned on the prevalence of direct cross-examination in family law proceedings involving allegations of family violence to identify the number of people likely to be affected by the ban. Further, the government consulted extensively on the measures in the bill, which strike the right balance between the need to protect victims of family violence from retraumatisation and the need for procedural fairness.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Evidence suggests that safeguards are not applied consistently in family law proceedings involving family violence. This creates a risk of retraumatisation for victims and, consequently, a deterrent from actually engaging in the judicial system. This bill will prioritise the safety of family-violence victims in family law proceedings by requiring that legal representatives conduct cross-examination or by ensuring that other protections are in place. Parties will be able to access the judicial system knowing that there are mechanisms in place to support them through what can be a very, very difficult process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government acknowledges that demonstrating the existence of family violence is complicated. Reporting family violence is challenging and, consequently, allegations of family violence are often made for the first time during family law proceedings. The government also acknowledges that each victim of family violence is unique and the effects of that violence will vary from victim to victim. For these reasons, the circumstances in which the legislative ban will apply comprise a variety of indicators that family violence has occurred. The court will also have the discretion to apply the ban where there are allegations of family violence but the prescribed circumstances are not met. If the ban does not apply, the bill will require the court to apply other protections for the victim, such as a video link or screens.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will protect all victims of family violence in family law proceedings that involve allegations of family violence. In short, this bill will ensure that all parties have a fair hearing, sufficient opportunity to make their case and the opportunity to test any adverse evidence presented by the other party. The measures in the bill will be reviewed after two years. This review will include looking at the costs of providing legal representation under the measures in the bill and will inform ongoing funding requirements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will improve the justice system's ability to support vulnerable witnesses by requiring the use of protections in family law proceedings that involve allegations of family violence. Further, this bill implements a number of expert recommendations and demonstrates the Morrison government's ongoing commitment to addressing family violence. I thank senators for their contribution, and I commend the bill to the Senate.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Australian Capital Territory</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Treasury and Finance</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:09</span>):  Firstly, I'd like to thank those senators who have contributed to this debate. The government's National Innovation and Science Agenda is driving the smart ideas that create business growth, local jobs and global success. The passage of this bill will improve the tax system for innovative businesses by better aligning the corporate tax regime with a culture of business investment and development. Improving the tax system for businesses will allow them to grow and become more productive and create jobs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are improving the way the tax system applies to innovative companies by changing the test which can deny these companies tax deductions when they have new investors and change aspects of their business. This bill amends the integrity rules which apply when a company has had a change of ownership and wants to use past year losses as a deduction to offset current year profits. The current same business test is overly restrictive and can prevent businesses from remaining agile and acting on emerging changes in the business environment out of concern that they may lose access to tax deductions. The new similar business test relaxes the restrictions and makes it much easier for businesses to change as their environment changes. It encourages innovation by enabling start-up companies to identify new uses for their products and to seek to diversify and grow their income streams. The new test will apply to losses made in income years commencing on or after 1 July 2015.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Tax shouldn't be a consideration when businesses seek to innovate and bring new products to market. It's not in our interests for these businesses to feel prevented from taking new opportunities simply because the tax system will penalise them for it. It distorts decision-making. Loss integrity rules remain important. The new test will not permit trading in losses in circumstances where companies buy up companies which have ceased trading and seek to use their losses as shelter from taxation. The similar business test will still require some continuity between the business carried on in the previous year and in the current year. The new arrangements will assist businesses, particularly smaller businesses, seeking to address problems which have led to losses by removing tax penalties which can arise when these businesses seek to restructure their businesses, ending loss-making activities and adding new profitable ones. The current test acts as a disincentive to change and grow, to take risks and harness new opportunities. These amendments ensure that Australia's tax system supports entrepreneurs and encourages agility. I commend this bill to the Senate.</span>

By omitting schedule 2 the bill will no longer allow taxpayers to avail themselves of this option. Given the application date of 1 July 2016 and the likely further delay in the passage of the bill, the government decided not to proceed with the measure, in order to eliminate the current uncertainty for taxpayers. The amendment will ensure the remaining measure in the bill will be legislated without further delay.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have significant issues with both parts 1 and 2. The first is the concept that tax losses from previous income years can be carried forward under a 'same business' test. I understand the difference between previous statements around continuity of ownership tests, but we are still not convinced that this is not going to help to supercharge phoenixing in this country. Tax losses themselves can be an asset to many companies, as I'm sure anyone in here who understands finance is aware. I don't see how this doesn't provide a further incentive for phoenixing. So we are not convinced about that. As far as the depreciation of intangible assets goes, we think it's a recipe for disaster to give any leeway or flexibility to companies to set their own depreciation schedules, especially for complicated aspects of depreciation. We didn't feel like we had comfort on either of those two measures and that's why the Greens opposed the second reading of this bill.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:24</span>):  We had issues with this bill, and in a second I will be moving a second reading amendment. I think it's worth noting this bill has been on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Notice Paper</span> for nearly six months. It's been listed seven times. Why haven't we dealt with this previously? It's obviously important legislation. There is some speculation as to why this hasn't come to the chamber previously. Obviously, our new minister, Mr Robert, from the other place, may not necessarily have been a popular choice within the coalition as the new minister. I understand he was a numbers man for our current Prime Minister and got an elevation following that. He, of course, had a fall from grace previously as a minister, and it's been quite strange that this legislation and some of his other legislation hasn't been able to get through to us here in the chamber. Nevertheless, I wanted to highlight that in my office we had a discussion and we were going to move as an order of business that this legislation be dealt with along with the bill that we've just passed so we could actually bring it on and get it through the chamber.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Nevertheless, I wanted to say, when we go back to the inquiry on this legislation, the Greens did have additional comments. We felt very strongly on a couple of issues. For most Australians, superannuation is compulsory deferred wages. It's intrinsically applied to their employment, and without a job, of course, there would be no superannuation. It follows that unpaid superannuation is not working capital for businesses. It is employee's money that should be disbursed as regularly and consistently as employees turn up for work. It should be that simple. So it makes little sense the payment of superannuation is not legislatively aligned with the payment of wages and that nonpayment of superannuation is not seen as being as heinous as the nonpayment of wages. In the digital age, with fully electronic payrolls and banking, there is no excuse for employers not to pay the Superannuation Guarantee each and every payday.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst this bill makes inroads towards addressing imbalance between the treatment of superannuation and the treatment of wages, it doesn't finish the job. The Australian Greens support a comprehensive range of measures designed to address the mismatch between superannuation and wages. The Senate Economics References Committee 2017 report, <span style="font-style:italic;">Superbad—w</span><span style="font-style:italic;">age theft and non-compliance of the Superannuation Guarantee</span><span style="font-style:italic;">,</span> which Senator Ketter, who is in the chamber, was involved in, explored the problem extensively and identified relevant issues. But even it fell short of making some simple and unequivocal recommendations that would help ensure employees get paid their superannuation. We recommended in a dissenting report to that committee that legislative changes be made to require superannuation to be paid in alignment with regular pay cycles or on a monthly basis—whichever is the lesser pay period.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:31</span>):  I rise to make a contribution on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Enhancing Whistleblower Protections) Bill 2017. At the outset, I indicate that Labor will be supporting this bill. We wish to acknowledge the tireless work of many stakeholders in this space who have fought for so long to see strength in protections for whistleblowers. In particular, Labor wishes to note the indefatigable Professor AJ Brown, Mr Jeff Morris, the Law Council of Australia, Transparency International and the Australian Council of Trade Unions, all of whom led the charge for these changes. It's been a matter of public record that Labor has a very longstanding commitment to enhancing whistleblower protections. In government Labor introduced the landmark Public Interest Disclosure Act 2013 for public sector whistleblowers, and Labor has already committed to introducing tax whistleblower protections.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Earlier in this term of parliament, the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services handed down its report into whistleblower protections. It makes sweeping recommendations to enhance protections for whistleblowers, and I hope to expand on my observations, being the deputy chair of that committee, and our amazing report. Senator Ketter has just left the Senate chamber, but I note he was a very significant participant in the evidence received and the significant recommendations made by that committee.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In response to the report, the government committed to strengthening protections for private sector whistleblowers. But the original bill that they put forward just under one year ago can only be described as weak and ineffective. Their initial proposal failed to enhance protections for whistleblowers in line with that PJC report, which basically gave them a blueprint for excellence. Their proposals did not match the substance and detail of the whistleblower protections included in the Fair Work (Registered Organisations) Amendment Bill 2014, and they were criticised by key stakeholders for falling far short of providing protections that private sector whistleblowers need and deserve. In fact, Professor AJ Brown, a leading expert on whistleblower protections, who gave evidence at the Brisbane hearing—and he is a member of the government's own expert panel—reportedly called the original bill 'a limited step' and 'more a sideways than a forward step on key issues'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's taken an extraordinary 12 months for the government to come up with the amendments to strengthen the bare bones bill that they first proposed, and Labor wishes to acknowledge in the course of the development of this matter before us today the hard work of Senators Patrick and Griff to force the government to strengthen this bill somewhat. It's disappointing that the government had to be dragged to action on this important issue. It's a theme that we see time and time again in this place—a Liberal government absolutely desperately resisting action on corporate misconduct. We've got to remember that this is a government that fought against the banking royal commission for 600 days, voting against it 26 times, and led by a Prime Minister who called it a 'populist whinge' and a 'reckless distraction'. Twenty-six times it was opposed by this Prime Minister.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is disappointing but not surprising that it took so much effort to force this government into action on corporate whistleblowing. As Mr Jeff Morris stated:</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I guess I see this as a bit of a parallel thing to the banking royal commission, where the government's finally, kicking and screaming, bowed to the inevitable and had a banking royal commission …</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The banking royal commission is shining a light on the widespread misconduct in the financial services industry. As Commissioner Hayne stated in the royal commission's interim report, our banks and financial service providers have been gripped by greed and 'the pursuit of short-term profit at the expense of basic standards of honesty'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the most shocking things about the banking royal commission has been how long this conduct went unchecked and also the sheer number of people who failed to blow the whistle on misconduct and potential crimes that were occurring. Their behaviour didn't happen in a vacuum. It happened in a culture that really did not enhance whistleblowing in any way and, in fact, they acted in a way that opposed the great civic action that whistleblowers undertake.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to acknowledge that we've just been joined in the public gallery by none other than Professor AJ Brown. I'd already quoted you twice in this speech before you entered. You have our sincere thanks for your contribution to this as a matter of significant public policy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the best ways to ensure that misconduct is prevented, detected and punished is to have strong, effective whistleblower protections. But, for too long, whistleblowers have been subjected to appalling treatment. Labor has heard stories of whistleblowers who did the right thing and reported misconduct, only to have their careers destroyed by companies that did not want to act, companies that ignored their calls for action, companies that let them be bullied and victimised, companies that made their positions at work untenable and companies that ruined their professional reputations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The current system operates as an enormous disincentive for whistleblowers to come forward. This is bad not just for those whistleblowers with the personal impact that it has on them. When whistleblowing doesn't occur, we are all harmed. Whistleblowers are absolutely critical to our efforts to crack down on corporate crime and corruption. As the Australian Federal Police argued through the Senate inquiry process into this bill:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">If people are discouraged from coming forward to regulators or law enforcement due to lack of protections for their safety, protection from legal action and the personal and financial impacts of disclosing company information, there may be no case to prosecute. Where people do come forward, but are not willing to give evidence, due to lack of protection for anonymity, law enforcement may not have sufficient evidence to prosecute. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are significant problems facing corporate Australia, from the scandals and rip-offs that have come to light through the banking royal commission to bribery allegations, chronic underpayment of superannuation, tax fraud and other illegal and improper conduct. We need whistleblowers to come forward. We need them to help our regulators and we need them for law enforcement agencies to detect and gather evidence sufficient to punish the unworthy conduct. This is why Labor passionately believes we must do more to protect whistleblowers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said in my opening comments, this bill, as originally drafted, was wholly inadequate. Labor senators outlined a number of concerns about the original bill in our additional comments to the Senate Economics Legislation Committee inquiry. The fundamental problem with the original bill, which has only been partly addressed by the government's proposed amendments, was that it was far too weak to provide whistleblowers with meaningful protection. Mr Jeff Morris said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It's kind of like just playing a game of paying lip-service to something. What troubles me is the parallel here—that this is called whistleblower legislation but, compared to what it could achieve, this is just a pale shadow of the real thing. … When you look at the recommendations of the PJC, and indeed, the submission of Professor Brown, it's just apparent that there's so much more that could be so easily achieved. What I don't understand is that the benefits that would flow through it are so massive.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For context, for those who might not fully understand why he features so significantly in my speech, Mr Morris was the whistleblower who really brought to light the issues around the Commonwealth Bank and inappropriate business activities that are now a part of the public record here in the country. He certainly featured very strongly in the banking royal commission. And I can remember meeting Mr Morris in my office in the main street of Gosford in my first term of parliament in the other place between 2010 and 2013. Not only was Mr Morris able to outline very, very clearly to me the issues that he was seeing in his workplace, which have since been prosecuted at the level of the royal commission, but he was also able, sadly, to document for me the significant damage to his personal life that resulted from him undertaking this important civic action.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some of the key measures that are missing from the bill, highlighted by Professor AJ Brown, include a chilling list of things that could have been attended to by this government which isn't willing to go far enough to protect the Australian public. The separation of criminal and civil remedies remains unaddressed. The government had the opportunity to, but didn't, undertake action to provide for civil remedies for detriment flowing from a failure in duty to support or protect. They didn't take up the opportunity to embed a best-practice version of reverse onus of proof or a reasonable filter against individual personal and employment grievances. Neither did they put in a realistic and appropriate protection for third-party disclosure—for example, by media—or public disclosure. This is a missed opportunity to do the best work that could have been done and should have been done in the name of the Australian people, following from the good work of thought leaders in academia and civic leaders who brought forward the issues, and from the work of a joint parliamentary committee that worked very hard to deliver a unanimous report with significant recommendations to guide the action of the government. Despite all that, we are left where we are—a few steps forward, rather than undertaking the whole journey.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's proposed amendments do significantly improve the original bill that they offered us a year ago, and, once again, I do wish to acknowledge the work that the Centre Alliance has done to actually force the government to amend this bill. The amendments proposed would clarify the eligible recipients of disclosures, addressing concerns raised by the Law Council of Australia, the Australian Institute of Company Directors and others that the broad array of eligible recipients might place undue burden on internal compliance policies within companies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments would also replace the protection of emergency disclosures with two categories of protected disclosures: an amended emergency disclosure category based on substantial imminent danger to a person's health or safety or the natural environment and a new public interest limb based on a broad public interest test. These amendments would also change the definition of 'journalist' for emergency and public interest disclosure categories to cover journalists— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator IAN MACDONALD</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:45</span>):  On 11 September 1990, I said in my first speech to this chamber:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The future of our nation lies in north Queensland and northern Australia—an area of enormous diversity …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also said in that speech that:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Northern Australia is, after all, the area which, with only 6.5 per cent of Australia's population, produces 45 per cent of Australia's export income.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was very keen at that time, as I have been during the whole of my relatively long public career, to advance and develop northern Australia. I'm very pleased to say that over those years we have succeeded far beyond the expectations I had all those years ago. I did say at that time as well, in my first speech:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">As one of only two of Queensland's 12 senators resident in north Queensland, my role in the Senate will be to concentrate on north Queensland and on northern Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That situation unfortunately hasn't improved. At the moment, I am the only senator representing the north of my state of Queensland, and I will be fighting hard to ensure that after the next election I am still there as a genuine northerner representing the people of the whole of Queensland, but with particular emphasis on Northern Queensland because, dare I say it, nearly all of the other of the 12 senators in Queensland reside in the south-east corner of the state. I expect that at the next election I will be the only senator from northern Australia, the only person from northern Australia with a chance of winning that is a genuine North Queenslander.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have achieved much to highlight the opportunities and the resources in northern Australia and North Queensland. Whilst it has been a passion of mine, you don't achieve things entirely by yourself, and I want to acknowledge the help that so many people have given over such a long time to the work of developing northern Australia. They include various groups, various organisations and a lot of councils in the north, people who've put their hearts and souls into achieving success in northern Australia. I will, in this speech, just highlight some of those successes. But, in doing that, I do want to acknowledge some people who have supported me so much in my goal to promote northern Australia, and that was from my first staffers, Xenia, Guy and Leanne, to my current staffers, Marie, James, Matthew, Michael, Isaac, Morganne, Lorraine, Sharyn and Peter—many of those are part-timers or volunteers, I might add—and of course my wife, Lesley, who has been at my side all of the time in the work that I've done for northern Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Perhaps one of the most significant things that happened for northern Australia was the development of the northern Australia white paper, which I had worked on, as had many other people, for a long period of time. I do want to pay recognition to the then Leader of the Opposition Tony Abbott for his encouragement and his understanding of the importance of the north and, dare I say also, his then Chief of Staff, Ms Credlin, who was very helpful in getting that forward as an opposition policy. That northern development white paper was eventually launched in 2015. Since then, the government has acted in a very exact way and a very precise way and a very practical way to assist with the development of northern Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to go through some of those successes achieved by the northern development white paper. I want to also acknowledge the government's acceptance, as recently as this time last week, of a proposal that I have long been fighting for. I remember talking to Peter Costello as Treasurer about this for many years and being rebuffed at every turn. But this time last week, the Treasurer, Mr Frydenberg, with the Prime Minister's support, announced that there would be a Productivity Commission review of the zone council rebate scheme, a scheme which, if it were brought up to date, would mean so much for those who live in and develop northern Australia and other remote parts of Australia where the cost of living is so exorbitant that it makes it difficult for these people to continue to exist.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The northern Australia white paper has resulted in many, many hundreds of millions of dollars going into the further development of the north, encouraging private enterprise into those areas, including $100 million allocated to the North Australian Beef Roads Program and $600 million to the Northern Australia Roads Program. I will mention the northern Australia water feasibility studies. The federal government can't build dams unless states agree, but we can do studies that will encourage state governments to act upon those feasibility studies and to build dams that are so important to northern Australia. Over $25 million has been spent on work towards feasibility studies for activities in northern Australia. The CSIRO recently completed a $15 million water feasibility assessment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Northern Australian Infrastructure Fund provides some $5 billion to private industry, to governments, to local governments and to agencies. If they are prepared to invest in the north, the Northern Australia Infrastructure Fund will provide very easy repayment terms and low-interest loans for that. I'm delighted that the NAIF has already supported the Kidston Pumped Hydro, the Onslow Marine Support Base, Humpty Doo Barramundi, James Cook University, the Pinjarra Road upgrade, Sheffield Resources and Northern Territory Airport—just to name a few. As well, the government has set up the Cooperative Research Centre for Northern Australia and that has already issued almost $3 million worth of support for research into activities which will help northern Australia, including smart supply chains, North Queensland agricultural supply chains, exporting perishable commodities to Asia, the Kakadu Plum value chain, eye-screening services, horticultural evaluation, Indigenous land use and bush products—the list goes on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition, there has been so much other support the government has given which will benefit northern Australia, not the least of which is, of course, the increased spending on defence, particularly for Australia's largest Army base at Lavarack in Townsville, HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Cairns</span>, the second-largest east coast naval base, and significant Air Force bases in the north. The Singapore deal with Singaporean troops is another step forward which will help in the development of northern Australia and in the support of our international defence arrangements.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Time won't allow me to go through this long list of achievements that the northern Australia white paper has achieved, suffice it to mention that there are many, including: regional employment trials, rural pharmacy maintenance, payment schemes for air services, research and development programs for reef restoration and adaptations, and solar voltaic cells. Across the board, just so many of these things will happen.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I conclude by thanking all of those who have had the faith that I've had in northern Australia and who have supported me and the government so strongly in getting these advancements and investments that will see northern Australia. As I said in my first speech, the future of our nation lies in North Queensland and northern Australia</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator STERLE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:55</span>):  As we round off this year—and this could possibly be my last contribution for this year or, who knows, the last one for this parliament, I don't know; Senator Cash might have a fairer idea than me—I want to go out on a happy note. I want to share with the Senate and those who are listening a magnificent project that we are going to have in this country very soon. It was brought to my attention in 2016 through a very, very close friend of mine, the one and only Robbie Williams—not the part-time singer that has recorded millions and millions of dollars worth of music, but my mate Robbie Williams from Fremantle—through a good mate of his, Mr John Goldsmith: the John Lennon Educational Tour Bus. This is a multimillion dollar, multifaceted mobile recording studio that runs through the roads of the United States. It's been going for 21 years. There is one in Europe that's been running since 2013. It gives the opportunity for kids in schools to put down music, write songs, make recordings, tell stories, make short films—all sorts of things—as it rolls around the United States and Europe.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I got on the bus in September of 2016 in New York. I was at the Come Together New York tenancy launch of the Lennon bus, where I had the pleasure of meeting the co-founder and CEO, Mr Brian Rothschild, and also got to meet Yoko Ono. There was a thought that maybe we could borrow the European bus for a three-year tenancy here in Australia.</span>
              </p>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberInterjecting">Senator Farrell:</span>
                  </a>  I saw it in Iceland.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="e68" type="MemberContinuation">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator STERLE:</span>
                  </a>  Yes, that's correct, Senator Farrell—in Iceland. I looked at it and thought, 'What a great idea.' Imagine something like this rolling through the highways and byways of Australia, giving Australian kids in remote and rural communities what American kids have been experiencing for 21 years and Europeans now for five or six.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have to say this. I don't have a lot of time, and there's so much to say. I will have a lot more to talk about as we come closer and closer. When I came back to Australia, my first mission was to reach out to the other side of the chamber about such a wonderful project as this and what it could mean for rural and regional kids. My first port of call was my good mate Senator Barry O'Sullivan from Queensland. We don't agree politically on very much most of the time, but one thing we do agree on is the opportunity for kids in the bush to advance their skills and their education. So Senator O'Sullivan partnered with my good self and off we went. We were on a mission to get an Australian build.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our first port of call was one of the biggest supporters apart from Senator O'Sullivan and me: Senator Nigel Scullion, the minister. The minister could actually see what that would mean not only to his part of the world in the Northern Territory but to all the remote communities. So Senator Scullion has been a dynamo on this, assisting us to try to get the funding to get this project off the ground. I must also congratulate Minister Ken Wyatt, the Minister for Indigenous Health. Mr Wyatt, as we would all know, is passionate about giving Aboriginal children and kids in the bush the opportunity to develop their skills, their educational learning and all sorts of stuff.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm really pleased that, when I asked Yoko if we could do the Australian bus, she said of course we could. There are absolutely no problems. Part of the work of the bus is not only to give the kids the opportunity to put down their music, to write songs and tell stories, incorporating culture, history and all sorts of things; it is also the ability for the kids to learn of the work of John and Yoko. Those of us who are here in this building with a little bit of grey in their hair and those who haven't got grey but were blessed to grow up with the music of the Beatles are mindful of their fine work not only in music and recordings but with John and peace and love. Part of the kids' teaching and recording opportunities is learning of the work of John and Yoko on racial integration, peace, harmony, activism, love—all of it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As we roll through, there are times in this place when we can have some fierce debates. There are times, particularly towards the end of the year, when people are tired and want to get home and get out of the madness of the Senate and the House of Representatives, but, I am pleased to say, with the constant support of Senator O'Sullivan at my side, the light at the end of the tunnel is not another train coming. I'm pleased to say that we've got two ministers who are very keen to see this project happen and to see that this bus is built. Then it will be up to the John Lennon foundation Australia to head off and start raising the money to get this thing rolling out. The bus will be crewed by Australians. It will be built by Australians. It will be operated by Australians. Part of the work of Senator O'Sullivan and me was to say we needed some credibility—not only for the Lennon bus but about with who would be the face of the Lennon bus in Australia. To get the opportunity from Yoko to have John's name and his image is no mean feat, let me tell you, for us music lovers and those of us who grew up with the Beatles' and John's work. This is the most highly regarded franchise in the world, and Yoko, through Brian Rothschild, has put her faith in Senator O'Sullivan and me, and the Australian government, to carry this through. It is wonderful.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator O'Sullivan tells me he does a great 'Amazing Grace' in the shower, as long as he's got his face in the corner. I'm happy to say he could pick a lot of songs, but, anyway, that's his choice. He'll probably get the opportunity to record along with me. I don't know how the kids are going to get time when we're there, Senator O'Sullivan. What Senator O'Sullivan and I agreed on was to get some musical credibility. In this land, we couldn't think of anyone more fitting than one Michael Chugg. We approached Chuggy, and we're happy to say that Chuggy is more than happy to come on board. I don't think anyone doesn't know Chuggy—thank you, Chuggy, for that, mate. We look forward to your experience and to your passion for Australian music and for giving kids the opportunity to get the music out there. We've also got Mark Pope on board as part of our team. You can google Mark: he's got a very extensive history of band management, managing the ARIAs and a host of other things that I don't have time to go through. They are two of the finest that I could get. Senator O'Sullivan and my wish is not only for the kids. Can you imagine the opportunity, the experience, for musicians out there who haven't got records in the charts to have members of the industry brought in on the bus and sharing their wealth of experience and knowledge with kids in the bush? We are seriously out there with the hand of friendship, as well. We know that businesses will want to get on board. We know that because a lot of businesses have said: 'What a magnificent idea that is. How do we get involved?' That's up to the foundation to work out.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I wasn't satisfied with just one visit to the bus. Brian Rothschild invited Senator O'Sullivan, Chuggy and me to New York—last year?—this year. Time does fly when you're having fun! We attended the 2018 Come Together New York City launch of the bus. We were pleased to be in the presence of Ringo Starr. We think we're pretty important, but when you're around the likes of Ringo Starr and Yoko Ono, we pale into insignificance in about one minute. We were happy to see the wonderful feeling around the bus. Not only that, they re-enacted the 1969 bed-in. That was interesting. We didn't get an invite, Senator O'Sullivan and I—we had to stand by the bus and watch. For those of you who may be interested, Senator O'Sullivan and I did an interview on the Beatles Facebook page, didn't we, mate? We actually hit the big time. I'm sure most of the people watching that interview probably thought, when they looked at Ringo: 'Geez, that face is familiar. Who's that bloke standing next to Sully and Sterly?'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, it is a magnificent feeling when you can put down the political bulldust that goes on between us in these chambers and ask: 'What can we as senators do together to improve our nation, to improve opportunity for our kids, and'—in Senator O'Sullivan and my case—'to improve opportunity in rural and regional Australia?' I know that Senator O'Sullivan and I have made this very clear as we've travelled and traversed our states and gone into the remote areas. We have garnered support from a myriad of organisations—I know how hard Senator O'Sullivan has worked; it will be up to him to share the good news—of the like of the Royal Flying Doctor Service and others, but I know the Aboriginal corporations and the educators that I have worked with extensively in the Kimberley can't wait for the opportunity to have this big blue bus roll through their town. Nothing would give me even greater pleasure than, one day, Senator O'Sullivan and me being somewhere and a young lady or a young man coming up to us and saying: 'You know what, you two? I never knew I could sing or play a musical instrument. I didn't realise I could get my creativity out. But it happened the day the John Lennon Educational Tour Bus rolled into my town in outback Queensland,' or WA. Thank you very much to the ministers who are supporting this project. It is an absolutely wonderful opportunity for kids in the bush.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="207807" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BURSTON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:05</span>):  With an election now likely in May 2019, I want to highlight the policies and principles that the United Australia Party, UAP, will be bringing to the federal election. UAP have a zonal taxation policy that will allow people living in rural and regional Australia to claim a tax rebate of 20 per cent every year. This rebate will not only apply to those who move into the regions but also to those who already live there. This taxation policy will help ease the infrastructure pressures being experienced in cities like Sydney and Melbourne by giving people the incentive to move to the regions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To further ease that pressure on infrastructure, the UAP also propose to reduce immigration levels to around 100,000 per annum, at least until the development of infrastructure catches up to population growth. The reduction will be skills based, not based on race or religion. To validate this policy, let's consider the cost of pump priming our population through immigration. Australians can see with their own eyes the congestion on our roads, the urban creep, the pressure on our environment and the sky-high housing market that has priced homes beyond the hopes of young families. The opening of the new real estate market to foreigners does not help—an outrageous exposure of citizens to global demand. Australians can see the rise of high-density housing degrading the architectural identity and amenities of their neighbourhoods. They can see the failure of infrastructure of all kinds to keep up. Is it no wonder when basic infrastructure costs $100,000 per extra person who immigrates?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">UAP intend to reduce electricity prices by refinancing network infrastructure—that is, poles and wires. Network charges make up at least 47 per cent of consumers' electricity charges in New South Wales alone. Contractors provide the finances of $45 billion to upgrade the electricity network at a 10 per cent interest rate. The electricity consumer is paying for this through their electricity bill. UAP will refinance this through government finance at two per cent, therefore reducing electricity bills.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Further, UAP will introduce a policy that will allow companies to pay their taxes annually rather than quarterly. This will inject $70 billion into the economy every time it is spent. The government will receive $7 billion in GST revenue. It will create demand, wipe out the deficit, allow more hospitals and schools to be built, and raise living standards. UAP will also introduce a policy to reduce the pension age to 60. This will not have a great impact on the budget bottom line and, indeed, will cost the equivalent of one per cent of Australia's foreign aid budget.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">During the election campaign, UAP will be announcing more policies that will raise living standards of all Australians. UAP intend to contest every lower house seat and every Senate seat in the 2019 election. As leader of the United Australia Party in the Senate, I give the Australian people the assurance that UAP will be placing Pauline Hanson's One Nation Party last or near last on every how-to-vote card across the country. The United Australia Party will not be recommending that preferences be directed to a dictatorship. It will not be recommending that preferences be directed to a party that has fraudulently registered their party in New South Wales. This registration will soon be tested in the Supreme Court of New South Wales. The United Australia Party will not be recommending that preferences be directed to a party whose leader allegedly accepted a multimillion dollar gift from an influential business person because of her support for the acquisition of significant property by them, according to the bragging Jimmy Ashby, the convicted criminal again heading to court later this month for allegedly breaching electoral law. I'm advised that this gift is secreted away in a trust fund called One Nation political trust, administered by Sydney based solicitor Danny Eid. The United Australia Party will not be recommending that preferences be directed to a party whose president for life's chief of staff, Jimmy Ashby, intimidates and harasses me and my staff. Just last week, Jimmy Ashby apparently made the comment to one of my staff, 'Old men die', or words to that effect. I felt it was a subtle death threat.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The United Australia Party will not be recommending that preferences be directed to a party whose president for life stalks and intimidates me and my staff by attending my electoral office in Toronto, New South Wales, in the company of two males and a former staff member of my office Wendy Leach, a prolific stalker of myself. This visit was despite an agreement being reached with the President of the Senate two days earlier that both parties would leave each other alone and avoid contact. Just like the company tax cut legislation, Pauline Hanson's One Nation Party president for life cannot keep her end of an agreement. Once again, as Leader of the United Australia Party in the Senate, I confirm to all Australians that our party will be placing Pauline Hanson's One Nation Party last or near-last on every how-to-vote card distributed by our party across the country at the next federal election.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator DUNIAM</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:11</span>):  I'm pleased to contribute to the senators' statements today and very pleased to be talking about the wonderful state of Tasmania. I'd like to touch on a couple of things today, starting with the Tasmanian Craft Fair, a wonderful event that I was able to volunteer at just a couple of weekends ago along with many members of the Deloraine rotary club, who do a fantastic job putting on this very large event. As I understand, it's the largest craft fair in the Southern Hemisphere. It takes place in the beautiful, picturesque, little town of Deloraine in northern Lyons in the state of Tasmania. This year, the event just past was the biggest event they've had for some time, despite some of the weather we experienced in the early days. Held each year in early November, it's a great opportunity for local crafts men and women, artisans and makers of fine food to put their wares on show to show the rest of the world what we do well in Tasmania. The number of visitors who come from interstate and overseas just to participate and attend that fair is amazing. It is a great testament to the volunteers who put it together. In particular, I'd like to pay tribute to Leslie Dare, who was the coordinator of this year's event, and the hundreds of volunteers who manned the stands and sorted out the logistics for the day. It was absolutely fantastic to see the effort that went into it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This year, the Deloraine rotary club are using some of the funds raised from the event to provide financial support to the Meander Valley SES rescue unit to buy a much-needed battery-operated combi tool, otherwise known as the jaws of life—a vital piece of equipment which will assist the SES and other volunteer organisations to do their job in a regional community that often experiences accidents and other disasters where tools like this are needed. Well done to the rotary club and those who supported that event.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In particular, I'd like to pay tribute to and commend those who won awards at the craft fair, including Jean Swinyard Ceramics, who was awarded the Premier's Award for Excellence; Bridget Farmer, who was awarded the Best Working Exhibit Award; Jennifer G Frost, who was awarded the Stand Presentation Award; Australian Landscape Jewellery, which received the First Time Exhibitor Award; and, probably the best award I think, which is the Providores Award, went to 7K Distillery. I look forward to getting along to next year's event, and I encourage as many of my Senate colleagues as can come to be there. It's a great event, and it will run from 1 to 4 November 2019.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also had the good fortune recently to visit the Gagebrook and Bridgewater community houses in Tasmania. Community houses provide a vital service to many communities that are, in some respects, disadvantaged. It was a pleasure to spend time with the crew who run those two particular community houses and examine some of the innovative ways they're looking to support their community and provide a service that they feel the community is benefitting from. The Gagebrook Community Centre, along with its sister house in Bridgewater, services the Brighton municipality and offers a range of programs to local residents. In particular, there is the Waterbridge Food Co-op, which is a wonderful community project that provides fresh, locally grown produce at an affordable price to local residents. In communities where there is social and economic disadvantage, the choice of dietary intake is often substandard. So this community house has come up with this great initiative—supported by the Tasmanian and Australian governments in the past, and I hope that it will be supported into the future—whereby fresh fruit and veg and other produce is made and put on offer for local residents to partake in. Frozen meals are also made at the Waterbridge Food Co-op, from the very affordable price of $3.50 per meal. I have been spruiking this to local businesses in the Hobart area, saying they should get onboard and support this great community house and buy healthy food options for their workplace lunches.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator DUNIAM:</span>
                  </a>  The Australian government has, in the past—thank you, Senator Cameron. When you're down in Tasmania I look forward to taking you out there to have a look. The good thing is that it also teaches locals ways of being able to grow their own food, harvest their own food and cook. These skills have been lost by many in the younger generation, so I commend those at the community houses, and at Waterbridge in particular, for putting this program on and supporting locals in the way they have. Particularly, I want to place on record my thanks and commendations to Cheynee, Helen and Chelsea from both of the community houses. They do a great job there. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was fantastic also to see the work that was being undertaken in the community gardens of both houses. Those community gardens are open to members of the public who want to come on in and harvest their own fruit and veg. It was put to me that they use the best fertiliser in Tasmania—so good, apparently, that someone was pilfering it at night. It's not one of those things I would look to steal—or anything, for that matter!—but someone out there was taking their fertiliser.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator DUNIAM:</span>
                  </a>  I will try and get the recipe for Senator Urquhart; we could all use it. So, there are a couple of fantastic entities there. I commend them and all the community houses around Tasmania for the work that they do in supporting disadvantaged Tasmanians and disadvantaged communities, teaching them healthy eating habits and providing the services that they do. I commend them, and I ask all Tasmanians to support them. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Moving to the east coast of Tasmania, I had the good fortune to visit the team at the Triabunna Village, an entity set up by the East Coast Regional Development Organisation. The village is a great little space where community groups of all shapes and sizes come together to meet, to practice their hobbies and to run a number of events. It was great to catch up with Glynis Flower, who showed me around the site and gave me an insight into what they're doing and what support they need into the future. I look forward to working with them on the things that they are looking to expand into, and also to hearing about the work of Tom Tenniswood, who is one of the coordinators there on site. The village, which is community run and community owned, is home to the Spring Bay Youth Hub, which meets regularly, and the village market, which, like many other events in the small towns around Tasmania, is an event where local craftspeople and manufacturers of fine produce can come and sell their wares to locals. That happens once a month.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's also home to the Spring Bay Community Boat Shed, which I was most interested to attend. The Spring Bay Community Boat Shed is part of the Tasmanian Men's Shed Association, another group of organisations that do a fantastic job, especially in small communities. Men's sheds are doing great work in Triabunna, and they service the surrounding area, the Glamorgan-Spring Bay municipal area. One of the projects I was shown by one of their coordinators, David Gatenby, is their restoration project of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Una</span>, a wooden vessel from the Strahan harbour that is rich in history. They've done a great job and are hoping to display this vessel at the next Wooden Boat Festival. It's held every two years in Hobart. So I wish that group very well in their efforts and, indeed, look forward to supporting them as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The village is also home to the Spring Bay Potters, which is another group of locals who come together to try their hand at arts and crafts. It was great to visit their new facility and meet with their coordinator, Dorothy Duncan-Jackson. Dorothy is very much, I could see upon my encounter, a force of nature. She was leading the group into their new facility and teaching them all sorts of new tricks. I didn't try any pottery because I know it's not my strong point! But these sorts of groups and organisations do good things for people who might be retired or might be easing out of the workforce. They give them things to do in the community, such as the men's sheds, the community houses, the Spring Bay Potters, the Spring Bay Youth Hub and the Spring Bay boat shed. All of these organisations do a wonderful thing for the people who participate in their activities. So, again, I say to those who are involved in running these organisations that I commend you and thank you for what you do and look forward to supporting you into the future.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="AI6" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CAMERON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:21</span>):  I rise today to discuss some serious issues in relation to apprentices. Apprenticeships and traineeships in this country, under the coalition, are in decline. The government has an appalling record on vocational education and apprenticeships. We now have 140,000 fewer apprentices and trainees than we did when this government was elected. Forty-six per cent of employers engaging apprentices are non-compliant in providing apprentices their proper wages and conditions. It was the government's own regulator, the Fair Work Ombudsman, who found this out. Employers are repeatedly exploiting apprentices.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A Melbourne plumbing firm has churned through numerous apprentices, and we note that at least five of them lasted less than 100 days. It's not surprising that non-completion rates are so high, with almost half of the young people who commence an apprenticeship or traineeship not finishing that apprenticeship or traineeship. A recent survey by the AMWU, the Australian Manufacturing Workers' Union, of their apprentices—and these are apprentices who are most likely to be in unionised, well-organised workshops—found that the key issues identified by apprentices were low pay, the cost of their tools, the lack of proper on-the-job mentoring, poor working conditions, including 13 per cent saying that they considered leaving their apprenticeship because of harassment and bullying, and poor-quality training and the cost of training. This is only the tip of the iceberg.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The position the government adopts is to throw more and more money at its mates in the context of apprenticeships. Former senator Bob Day was handed $2 million by Senator Birmingham and the government to look after 20 apprentices—a subsidy of something like $90,000 per apprentice. It's crazy stuff. We also see that we've now got the government picking up a One Nation thought bubble, and that's this so-called 'bush wage' where the government is actually funding the wages of apprentices, subsidising employers by funding the wages of apprentices. These some 1,600 apprentices will be spread around rural and regional Australia. There's a reason why apprentices are not engaged in rural and regional Australia to the extent that you would think they would be—that is that the conditions in some of these places are pretty bad. And I am really concerned about the safety implications for apprentices arising out of this One Nation thought bubble adopted by Senator Cash. I think it's really bad. Senator Cash needs to come to the chamber and explain what safety measures will be in place for these apprentices and what on- and off-the-job training will be available to these apprentices. You can't just run up a thought bubble and that's the end of the situation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to raise it in the context of what we have seen recently in a metropolitan workshop with the tragic death of Dillon Wu, a young man, a 20-year-old undertaking his apprenticeship, who was contracted out by the Australian Industry Group to the company Marshall Lethlean. This young man, who was 20 years old, died on the job while working as an apprentice boilermaker for the Australian Industry Group, which is the company that was supposedly looking after this young man. He died on Thursday, 4 October. I spoke to his family today to get their permission for me to raise these issues in the Senate. They want this raised because they want no other young person to suffer the same fate as this young worker. He died in a tank. He was grinding welds in a tank. There was argon leaking from a line attached to the welding unit that was in the tank with him. There was no ventilation, no gas monitor, no spotter and no supervisor. No-one was checking on this young man. There was no air testing conducted prior to him starting work, and the apprentice did not have confined space certification. The welding unit was not suspended outside of the confined space, and, at the previous Dandenong facility of this company, that would have happened.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The AMWU health and safety rep was the first person on the scene. He jumped into the tank and was immediately overcome by fumes. I'm advised that he is so traumatised by this situation that he has had to leave the company. Members and other workers attempted to resuscitate the young boilermaker, but they were unsuccessful. What really concerns me is that, prior to this death, the Australian Industry Group, who employed the apprentice, had undertaken a safety analysis—an OHS Essentials Program report. What they found was that 11 out of 24 safety issues that were identified were considered high risk where this young apprentice died. And, according to the AiG's own analysis, high risk means a significant risk, an almost certain likelihood of a serious consequence. What could have been more serious than a young man in the prime of his life losing his life because of these problems? What was seen there was unbelievable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The AiG, in its own report, indicated that there was a high risk in terms of risk management in this place. Risk assessments had not been undertaken on high-risk activities. Documented workplace inspections to identify and manage hazards had not been undertaken. This is just unacceptable in the middle of metropolitan Melbourne, yet we are now, under this government, going to send 1,600 apprentices to the bush to undertake apprenticeships, with no analysis of the safety risks and no planning for the safety or the training of those apprentices that I am aware of. Also, in this company that young Dillon Wu worked for, workers are currently working in confined spaces; however, risk assessments, permit systems and safe operating procedures are not available and/or used. This is a high risk that was identified by the Australian Industry Group themselves. To add to this tragedy, a WorkSafe inspector had actually attended this firm. Half an hour after he left, Dillon Wu died in a confined space. WorkSafe Australia were actually on that plant.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So how can this nonsense position be proposed? It's a One Nation thought bubble picked up by this coalition government to placate One Nation. Over 1,600 young people may end up in apprenticeships with no proper safety analysis being done and with no on- and off-the-the-job analysis being done. This must take place. I am really concerned. A thought bubble is not the way to look at apprenticeships in this country when apprentices are dying on the job. This government doesn't get it.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:32</span>):  Now, now, children. I'm actually going to speak about children. Last week, thousands of schoolkids all around the country went on strike. In capital cities, in regional centres, right around the country, kids went on strike because this government has repeatedly failed to act and do its job. It has failed to act on climate action, failed to show leadership on climate action and failed to prevent the emerging climate catastrophe. In my home state of Tasmania, schoolkids are so frustrated with this government that they went out a day earlier than the other states. Thousands rallied outside the state parliament in Hobart last Thursday. Tasmania leading the way again makes me bloody proud as a father of two young Tasmanians and as a senator for my state of Tasmania.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week's Strike 4 Climate Action was an extraordinary event and an inspiring event. These children are our future leaders. They're smart, they're strong and they're clear-headed about what is important, about what kind of future they want for all of us. I was lucky enough to be in Sydney on Friday and to go to Martin Place for the rally. I listened to their poetry, their words and their songs. I saw and drank in their optimism and their inspiration—exactly what a tired and jaded Greens senator needed at the end of a long parliamentary year, at the end of a year of constantly fighting to get the environment and the climate on the political agenda.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, all too predictably, this government could only respond by putting on their 'stern daddy' faces and saying how naughty these kids were for not being in school—patronising, dismissive, burying-your-head-in-the-sand kind of stuff. The Prime Minister told parliament last week, before the event:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">What the Prime Minister didn't appreciate was that all good protests need good signs. And if you've got some fresh material to work with, you can get some really good signs. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to share with you some of those signs from the protests last week—because schoolkids right around this country were very quick with their reposts. Here is a selection: 'Schools have to be parliament when parliament is a schoolyard,' 'Procrastinating is our job, not yours,' 'I've seen smarter cabinets at Ikea,' 'Why should we go to school if you won't listen to the educators,' 'Naughty kids get coal; nice kids get a carbon tax,' 'We'll be less activist if you'll be less shit,' 'If you were smart, we'd be in school,' and, lastly, the one I like the most, 'Mess with the climate and in the future we'll mess with your pension.'</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week's event was inspired by a 15-year-old Swedish student, Greta Thunberg, in protest against her government's inaction—which, believe me, is a damn sight better than our government's. Greta has spent every Friday sitting outside her nation's parliament. She said, 'I will continue to do so until leaders come into line with the Paris Agreement.' She has started a global movement. She also said:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is what last Friday was all about. Primary and secondary schoolkids are so worried about their future, so worried about the fate of this planet—humankind and all other inhabitants of this planet—and so frustrated with this government and the world's governments' inability to act on climate change that they feel the need to get organised and take global action. And that, senators, is quite an indictment on all of us. Our kids are so devoid of hope for their future that they've gone on strike. That's a hell of a load for them all, at their age, to be carrying. We need to sit up and listen. Also, we need to recognise that this might be the start of something new. If the Prime Minister is worried that these kids are going on strike, he might want to reflect on what people might be prepared to do when more and more of them start to understand the true enormity of the climate emergency we face and the self-interested, short-sighted idiocy that is preventing action—good policy, leadership and the courage to act. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the first time in human history that we have all faced a global existential crisis of our own making. We are the first generations to have to cope with a climate emergency, and we will be the last generation that can stop it. Think about that for a second. When people start to fully understand and internalise, when people realise that we have to choose to avoid a catastrophe—and that our inaction is because of the vested interests that have a stranglehold on our politics—the Prime Minister and future prime ministers might wish for the day when all they had to worry about was schoolkids going on strike. History is full of examples of people taking extreme action and direct action in the face of opposition from the ruling class to achieve progress, and when the future of civilisation is what is at stake we might expect that people will be prepared to take direct action; a future of civil disobedience.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government, and others which refuse to act, will have the blame for this land squarely at their feet. I hope that the schoolkids of Australia feel emboldened to state clearly that they want their government to give them hope and to give them a vision of a future that they can believe in. I hope that next year we'll see them out again, in bigger numbers and with a stronger voice, if this parliament and this chamber refuse to act. And I hope the same is said of children all around the world. And I hope that at next year's election people vote for a future for these schoolkids so that we get rid of this pathetic, chaotic rabble of a government who only care about themselves and their political power games. The Greens will be unwavering in doing whatever we can to give hope to the next generation so that we can avoid nothing less than a calamity on this planet. Prime Minister and future prime ministers: don't say you weren't warned.</span>

It has 270,000 signatures—a global movement to protect the Tarkine, or takayna, in north-west Tasmania. Senators, if you haven't visited Tasmania, if you haven't been to takayna, or Tarkine, please come down this summer. To see is to want to protect our wild and special places. Tarkine is one of the most special places on earth; one of the last unprotected great wildernesses in the Southern Hemisphere. Sooner or later we will get there.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="237920" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator STOKER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:42</span>):  I rise to speak about the amendments the government has proposed in this chamber to the Sex Discrimination Amendment (Removing Discrimination Against Students) Bill 2018, because in all of the political huffing and puffing on this issue I still think there are very few people who actually understand them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to start with two important propositions. The first is that no student should be discriminated against on the basis of their sexuality alone. That is something on which all sides of this chamber agree; it's not in contest. So everyone can stop grandstanding about how good they're going to be to vulnerable students. That change is going to happen, and that's despite the fact that no student has ever been expelled from a religious school for being gay. So let's start by taking that inflammatory matter well and truly off the table.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The second proposition is this: it is a right fundamental to being a free person in a free society that we're all entitled to freedom of religion, because, at its core, it's about freedom of thought and freedom of association. It is utterly non-negotiable in a free society.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I support the government's amendments to the bill because they ensure that no student will be discriminated against on the basis of their sexuality alone in a way that sensibly balances the rights of schools that are religious to operate according to the tenets of the faith for which they were established. It is utterly extraordinary, for example, that a simple amendment stating that it is not unlawful to teach the doctrines of a religion in good faith is so abhorrent to Labor. They reject it outright. So all can see that this is simple, commonsense stuff.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me read out amendment KQ149, and I'll do it word for word:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small"> (1) Nothing in this Act renders it unlawful to engage in teaching activity if that activity: </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(a) is in good faith in accordance with the doctrines, tenets, beliefs or teachings of a particular religion or creed; and </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(b) is done by, or with the authority of, an educational institution that is conducted in accordance with those doctrines, tenets, beliefs or teachings.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's it. It's simple stuff. It should be uncontroversial, particularly in the context of schools giving up the exemptions they had in the past—and, yet, Labor will not have it. They resist the most simple, basic protection of the right to teach a faith in a school chosen by parents because it offers a faith based education. This exposes the real agenda here. It is to gut religious schools of their religious foundations. That's an assault on freedom that should disturb all Australians, no matter what their political views are. Labor shouldn't be able to get away with what they're doing here, paying lip service to the importance of religious schools while refusing to accept that they deserve the simple right to teach what they have believed for centuries—demanding that religious doctrine bow down and be overridden by the desire to ensure that no-one could suffer detriment simply by hearing it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me make it very clear: no-one in this country has to be religious. No parent needs to send their child to a religious school. There are plenty of religion-free zones in our public schools and in many independent schools. If that's what you as a student want or if that's what you as a parent want, it is available to you. But don't take religion away from those who do want it, for those who do believe with every fibre of their being.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Here is another amendment that should also be unobjectionable—KQ147. It would stop the amendment to section 37 proposed by Labor, and here's why. That provision is a massive overreach. It attempts to apply discrimination law well beyond the schoolyard. It wants to apply it inside a synagogue, in the pulpit, in the sermon, in the mosque and in the seminary. It represents an aggressive move to regulate the content of religion, and it is damning to freedom of thought, speech and faith because of it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, there's amendment KQ148, in which the government would insert a section 7E to the act. This is an important amendment to understand because it actually provides considerable protection to students struggling with gender or sexuality. It provides that when considering the defence of reasonableness to indirect discrimination it will be relevant to take into account whether the condition, requirement or practice imposed by the educational institution is one that's imposed in accordance with the tenets of the faith and—here's the kicker; here's the important bit—'in accordance with a publicly available policy'. The reason this helps students is that it is up-front and clear as crystal. Before anyone enrols in a religious school, before anyone is in doubt, before anyone is in conflict, the school must, if it wants to rely on this section, be very clear about how it will handle these issues. This transparency is a protection for students, but it also gives necessary certainty for schools. It also, very importantly, provides that schools must have regard to the best interests of the child in a customised, personalised way.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">None of these amendments are extreme. All are simple, balanced and fair to all students, whatever their views and wherever they are at in their lives. The resistance to these amendments and the political grandstanding is proof of the extreme Left's aggressive agenda. That agenda is borne out when we see that they will not even contemplate these amendments. I think that's a very sad thing for freedom in this country.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BILYK</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:49</span>):  I'm disturbed by recent news that 37 people have died on Tasmanian roads in the 12 months to September 2018. This represents a 20 per cent increase over the previous 12-month period and, despite a gradual improvement in the road toll over many years, this recent spike is concerning. Tasmania's road death rate sits at around seven deaths a year per 100,000 people, the second-highest in Australia after the Northern Territory. Australia-wide, over the same period, 1,200 people died on our roads.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the government's report, <span style="font-style:italic;">Inquiry into the National Road Safety Strategy 2011-2020</span>, points out, if we cannot improve road safety, then at the current rate we will see 12,000 deaths over the next decade and 360,000 injuries at a cost of more than $300 billion. This can include some horrific lifelong injuries, such as brain damage, paralysis, amputations or loss of sight, yet somehow we've come to accept this as normal, but people being killed and maimed on a daily basis should not be accepted as normal. Our road trauma needs to be treated as a national emergency.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I believe an important first step is to have a dedicated road safety portfolio with the federal ministry, something that is currently lacking. Labor has recently appointed my colleague Senator Glenn Sterle, from Western Australia, as the shadow assistant minister for road safety. Senator Sterle has a strong background in this area as a former truck driver and organiser for the Transport Workers' Union, and he was advocating for improved road safety even before he came into this place. For one group of people, road safety is of particular importance, and that is our road freight transport workers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've also spoken recently in this place about the abolition of the Road Safety Remuneration Tribunal, a decision which has cost lives. With the establishment of the RSRT came a system for setting safe rates of pay, a system which led to a 25 per cent decline in the number of fatalities resulting from heavy truck crashes. In an industry where workers are 13 times more likely to die than in any other industry, truck drivers should not be forced to work an 80-hour week or be unable to raise safety concerns with their employer for fear of being fired. This is not just a risk to the drivers themselves but to the rest of the travelling public—to you and to me.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Transport Workers' Union has also been calling for road deaths involving commercial heavy vehicles to be treated as workplace deaths. This will allow investigators to determine whether factors such as time and cost pressures contributed to the death through fatigue, speed or lack of vehicle maintenance. I would like to, at this point, congratulate the TWU Members First Team on their re-election. They've worked very hard over many, many years to improve road safety, as I say, not just for the truck drivers but for the general public. I think that the recent TWU elections have shown the great work that they've been doing, and that's shown in the great result that those elections brought.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian government's blueprint for road safety is the National Road Safety Strategy, a 10-year plan adopted in 2011, which is very soon due for renewal. The government's own inquiry into the strategy has some alarming findings in terms of the failure to act on the strategy and to achieve success against it. It seems clear to me from the inquiry report that the failure is not necessarily one of the strategy itself but the lack of progress in implementing it. One of the key findings of the inquiry has been the lack of coordination between the three levels of government, all of which bear some responsibility for road safety. This problem is summed up in the following excerpt:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The governance capability, combined with poorly defined and resourced actions, ill-defined accountability and an inability to report on progress in a meaningful way has been the background headline behind the implementation failure.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The report also criticises the fact that when crashes occur we have a culture of looking at the performance of the road user rather than asking about the safety attributes of the road, the safety qualities of the vehicles and the appropriateness of the speed limit. With their Vision Zero approach, Sweden has demonstrated that it is possible to dramatically reduce road trauma, but, to do so, first you need a cultural change. You need to adopt an attitude that any death or serious injury on the road is unacceptable. You need to overcome the complacency that comes with accepting that carnage on our roads is the norm. It's profoundly disappointing that progress on addressing Australia's road toll has stalled, but it's especially disappointing when we have a good strategy but are lacking in national leadership to see it through. Even one death or injury on our roads is one too many.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, there is a strategy, but the implementation of that strategy seems to have hit a hurdle. It's up to the three levels of government to make sure that those hurdles are overcome. We have the policy, and it's all right to talk about it but we need to actually act on it—that's what's most important to us. If you don't have enough resources, and the actions can't take place, then there is no point in actually having the strategy. I would encourage everybody to talk to their federal, state and local government members to make sure that they're implementing, as much as they can, the changes that need to take place so that we can save lives.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reason I took Senator O'Sullivan's interjection about mining workers in Queensland is that the failure of this government last night to sign on to this declaration just demonstrates again that they have no concern whatsoever for mining workers, whether in Queensland or in other parts of the country. Labor has attempted a number of times to either move amendments or take other action to stop labour-hire exploitation, to stop casualisation in the mining industry in Queensland, only to see the LNP, particularly National Party representatives, take the side of mining companies rather than mining workers. The government's refusal to sign on to this declaration last night shows that this government not only is ignoring the fact that our energy mix is changing but also wants to leave Central Queensland mining workers, who will be affected by changes to our energy mix, completely in the lurch. They don't want to take any steps towards assisting these workers to transition to new work. They want to leave them to the vagaries of the market, to be thrown on the scrap heap. Senator Canavan is one of the worst offenders in claiming to support mining workers but always backing up Glencore, BHP and every other mining company.</span>

Yesterday, the Prime Minister was forced by his own backbench to retreat on his energy big stick, with the Prime Minister waking to headlines, including 'Morrison's energy "big stick" cut down to size'. Reports indicate Deputy Leader of the Liberals, Julie Bishop, warned the Liberal party room that the big stick threatened investment, could be regarded as a sovereign risk and is inconsistent with Liberal values. It is also reported that other backbenchers, including Jason Falinski, Russell Broadbent and Craig Laundy, spoke out strongly against the proposed legislation. How many members of his own backbench did it take for Mr Morrison to retreat?</span>

The big-stick legislation has been approved by our party room, and I'm pleased to confirm what it does. The bill amends the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 to provide a legislative framework to strengthen the government's ability to address misconduct in electricity markets. Let me say that slowly: to address misconduct in electricity markets. Do you want to leave misconduct in electricity markets unaddressed? Are you against addressing misconduct in electricity markets? Is that really what you're saying?</span>

Here's a prediction: I think we might get some bipartisan support, because I think that Bill Shorten will not want to be left out when it comes to the big stick—I'm very, very confident of that—although, everybody will know it's a coalition big stick, even if the Labor Party gets on board, to bring electricity prices down and to ensure that we've got reliable supplies of energy.

It is designed to bring electricity prices down. The reason I wasn't prepared to share the details underpinning the giant stick with David Speers—as I've previously said, he's one of the best interviewers in the business—was because the legislation had not as yet been finalised. We were consulting in relation to the legislation. I actually started to explain the detail, but you didn't listen to that, so I'm quite happy to go to the detail again. The bill creates new prohibitions against certain misconduct in electricity retail, wholesale and contract markets which is detrimental to competition or consumers. Importantly, on the recommendation of the ACCC and following a referral from the Treasurer, Federal Court issued divestment orders can only be made—and I'm happy to continue— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Merry Christmas! Ho, ho, ho! Last week, the question was about our overall energy policy, and our overall energy policy has indeed been refined after the recent change in prime ministership. But, when it comes to the giant-stick legislation, we've been going through a proper process of consultation with stakeholders and we have now finalised that legislation. Under that legislation, divestiture court orders can only be made where a corporation's conduct is fraudulent, dishonest or in bad faith for the purpose of distorting or manipulating prices and where the order results in a net public benefit. My question to the Labor Party is: will you really stand in the way of such a power? Are you really going to stand in the way of a giant stick to ensure we can keep electricity prices down? <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

The government will grow the defence budget to two per cent of GDP by 2020-21, two years ahead of our election commitment in 2013. We are able to make these investments because of our prudent economic management. This is a commitment which will give the Australian Defence Force members the equipment they need to operate effectively well into the future.</span>

We're investing hundreds of millions of dollars in the infrastructure required in preparation for the build and use of these naval vessels. That includes over $1.5 billion of investment in Western Australia at a number of facilities and $535 million at the Osborne South Naval Shipyard, with further redevelopment to occur at the Osborn north submarine yard, also creating hundreds of jobs in that process. We're investing in the build and sustainment of the cutting-edge Boxer combat reconnaissance vehicles, with construction to be based in Queensland. We've also continued to invest in the acquisition of 72 Joint Strike Fighter aircraft, the first two of which will arrive in Australia next week, a momentous occasion.</span>

We have set ambitious Australian industry content standards for all our major acquisitions, ensuring that if work can be done in Australia, it is done in Australia. Last week, in fact, an Oxford Economics report found the Hunter class frigate project would create over 6,300 jobs, contribute $17 billion to the Australian economy and use 48,000 tonnes of Australian steel, with over 500 Australian companies prequalified to work on the project. The Future Submarine program itself is expected to create 2,800 jobs. The offshore patrol vessels are expected to create up to 1,000 jobs and the boxer CRVs up to 1,450 jobs nationally, with around 70 per cent Australian industry content and, as I said, the build focused in Queensland. From Perth to Sydney, from Hobart to Darwin, in cities and in regional areas like Rockhampton and Nowra, our investment is paying dividends.</span>

During their final three years in office, they cut defence investments by almost 18 per cent, leading to the lowest level of defence spending since 1938, at only 1.56 per cent of GDP. That has real impacts on defence capability and on jobs. Under those opposite—under the Australian Labor Party—119 defence projects were delayed, 43 projects were degraded and eight projects were straight-out cancelled. They didn't commit to the build of one single naval vessel in Australia in six years in government. During their last period in government, defence industry shrank by 10 per cent, so we could not be taking a more different approach than those opposite. We are bringing the budget— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

But let me also remind the Senate of my answer to the previous question, which pointed out that this legislation that we are putting forward is designed to strengthen the government's ability to address misconduct in the electricity markets. The proposed court-ordered divestiture powers would relate to a corporation's conduct where that conduct is fraudulent, dishonest or in bad faith for the purpose of distorting or manipulating prices and where the order results in a net public benefit. So I would throw the question back to you: do you believe it's unreasonable for the government to give itself the power and authority to deal with conduct which is fraudulent, dishonest or in bad faith for the purpose of distorting or manipulating prices and where the order results in a net public benefit?</span>

We're on the side of making sure that we have the lowest possible electricity prices and reliable energy supplies. We believe that this, as part of a suite of measures, is one of the tools that the government should have available, subject to appropriate checks and balances and procedural safeguards which, after the consultation has taken place, are now of course a feature of this bill. In the end, Labor will have to form a judgement on whether they want to stand on the side of this sort of conduct or whether they want to side with us to address it more effectively.</span>

We actually take the view that this is an important component of a suite of measures designed to bring electricity prices down and to ensure that we can have more reliable supplies of energy. With the greatest respect to another important organisation, I say that there are a lot of vested interests in this sort of space—inevitably—and they will argue their own book. I don't criticise them for that; that is their job. But our job as a government and our job as a parliament is to make judgements about what is in the public interest, and in our judgement it is in the public interest for us to have the opportunity to pursue court-ordered divestitures in the circumstances where a corporation's conduct is fraudulent, dishonest or in bad faith for the purpose of manipulating prices and where the result is a net public benefit. You are entitled to take a different view, of course, but we, having considered all of the arguments, all of the different perspectives from different stakeholders, have come to the view that in the public interest— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Late yesterday evening it was reported that the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security had struck a compromise deal on the Telecommunications and Other Legislation Amendment (Assistance and Access) Bill 2018, yet there is still no publicly available information on the substance of this deal. The Department of Home Affairs has received over 15,000 submissions on this bill, yet the government endorsed it and subsequently introduced it without change, referring it to the intelligence and security committee. The committee has received hundreds of submissions speaking to the critical failings of the bill and the consequences, intended or otherwise, of it, yet there have been no significant changes made. When will the details of the deal struck be made publicly available?</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment and Deputy Leader of the Government in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:18</span>):  I thank Senator McGrath for his question and for his unflinching advocacy for Australian farms and businesses, especially those in Queensland. Over the last 24 hours, the release of September quarter balance of payments and national accounts figures show just how strongly our exporters are doing right across Australia. It shows that net exports are contributing 0.3 per cent to real September quarter GDP growth, and there is ongoing contribution that sees exports, overall, sustained as part of our overall trading relationship—around one in five Australian jobs.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We see, in particular, commodities' strong growth—rural commodity prices rising 5.4 per cent, with exports of meat up 3.2 per cent, exports of wool and sheepskins up 6.3 per cent, and exports of oranges and almonds up almost five per cent. In other sectors we see LNG exports are up almost 17 per cent, other manufactured exports are up 3.2 per cent and travel services are up 5.8 per cent. What we clearly see is that, across a whole range of different sectors of the economy, Australian farmers, Australian businesses, are seizing the opportunity to be able to sell more of their goods and services to the world and, in doing so, are lifting their incomes and the income of Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed, in Senator McGrath's home state of Queensland, the company Frosty Boy, a manufacturer and distributor of powdered desserts and beverages, has grown 30 per cent in the last 12 months. It now employs 70 staff and says its exports now make up 70 per cent of its business. Since 2001, we have seen an average yearly growth of about 17 per cent. These are the types of businesses, small and medium-sized businesses across Queensland and Australia, that are seizing the opportunities created by our trade agreements to do more business and to sell more Australian goods and services to the world. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

I have a follow-up to my question last week regarding the international investigation into medical devices and Australia being effectively a dumping ground for products not permitted for use in the US. One product, a shoulder implant named PyroTITAN, was approved by the Australian TGA in 2011 and classified as low risk. There were several early failures and, two years later, the device was suspended. However, patients were not notified by the implant sponsor or treating surgeons of any of the failures. By way of contrast, every registered vehicle owner with a faulty Takata airbag received a recall notification so they could mitigate the health risks of an exploding airbag. Why hasn't the government mandated that patients must be notified when an implanted medical device is found to be faulty?</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is not a dumping ground for therapeutic devices. That part of your question, I have to refute. I don't think that is the case, but I am more than happy to answer the other elements of your question. I think it is quite proper to point out the analogy of why is it that when my car looks like it might hurt me there is process under which there are mandatory legislative and regulatory requirements to ensure the owners of other cars are alerted? We do have a very important process under which the colleges of medical practice are informed about these matters, because it is actually their responsibility to ensure that doctors are required and mandated to report on a device or a failure of a device. The Chief Medical Officer has in fact written to that particular college, to the medical groups and to professional bodies to encourage them to consider the recommendations of the Senate inquiry into transvaginal mesh implants, which dealt with devices and the mandatory reporting more generally. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

But under the circumstances, will the government commit to a mandatory device register, at the very least for high-risk devices, going forward?</span>

We have asked the colleges how they would wish us to respond. It is only my view—and I have listened carefully and read much of what you've put forward—that it's not a matter for the producers of the devices; it's their use in Australia that should be on a mandatory register, and any failings of that should be subject to mandatory reporting. We are waiting to hear back from industry, not from the device manufacturers or owners of those patents. I'm not the minister, so I can't guarantee how that will be, but we will take their recommendations seriously on whether to legislate or regulate, and we'll take that into consideration.</span>

Three weeks ago, I cited research by AlphaBeta Advisors, a firm headed by Andrew Charlton, who was previously chief economic adviser to former Labor Prime Minister Kevin Rudd. That revealed that the NBN is driving business growth across the country and, in particular, female entrepreneurship. For example, the research found the growth in self-employed women in NBN-connected areas is 20 times the pace of that in non-NBN-connected areas. Last week, a televised address featuring three leading businesswomen at the National Press Club put real faces to the stats which show how connectivity is helping women realise their business dreams.</span>

Indigenous woman Mikaela Jade built her cutting-edge tech firm, Jabiru, three hours drive from Darwin. Mikaela showed how augmented reality technology is bringing ancient Indigenous stories to the world via an impressive app which you can download on your phone. She spoke about how internet connectivity is helping Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities sell their bush medicine products to the world over the web. And Olivia Ruello, CEO of Business Chicks, uses the internet to drive Australia's largest and most influential community for women. Last week, these women took to the national stage as real-life examples of how fast broadband delivered over the NBN is helping to achieve business dreams.</span>

According to the AlphaBeta research, in the 2017 financial year, the NBN was estimated to have generated $1.2 billion in additional GDP nationally, including $450 million in regional Australia. Once the rollout is complete, it's estimated that the network will deliver an additional $10.4 billion in GDP per year nationally, including $5.3 billion a year in regional areas. Thanks to the actions of this administration, the majority of Australians are, I'm pleased to report, having a good experience. In March, the ACCC's Rod Sims said that speed delivery was 'better than expected' and that the results 'go against the current wisdom that the majority of consumers and businesses are having issues with NBN speeds'.</span>

In August, NBN released DOCSIS 3.1 technology which will nearly double downstream capacity and provide gigabit speeds over the HFC part of the network when future demand requires it. When our colleagues opposite were in office, the NBN wasn't allowed to deviate in the slightest from the fibre-to-the-premises model, no matter the cost and no matter the weight. They were paralysed by technology constraints which saw some houses costing $20,000 and more to connect to fibre. This government is not taking a theological approach to the NBN. We're taking a technological approach. We're getting it built. It will be done and dusted by 2020. That's good news.</span>

The Minister for Home Affairs has been a strident critic of the AAT for overruling departmental decisions to deport assorted terrorists, paedophiles, drug smugglers, Iranian holiday-makers and criminals.</span>

The government commissioned a statutory review by the Hon. Ian Callinan, AC, QC, which was due on 31 October. The News Corp media reported yesterday that the review scorches the AAT as a bloated bureaucracy, bogged by refugee advocates gaming the system and, among other reforms, proposes restricting the production of late evidence. When will we and the Australian people see the Callinan report?</span>

There are 50,000 active cases in the AAT's Migration and Refugee Division, with 43 per cent more applications over the last year. In the refugee division, an increasing number of cases are being overturned. I acknowledge that last month the government made a host of new part-time appointments but, given there are tens of thousands of appellants waiting to be sent home for Christmas, when will the government put an end to the bloated bureaucracy bogged by refugee advocates gaming the system? <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

But you are actually correct: the volume of applications in the Migration and Refugee Division of the AAT has increased significantly since 1 July 2015. So the statutory review of the AAT that was required and commissioned by the Attorney-General is, in fact, timely.</span>

You don't even have to think about the vibe; you've just got to look at the provisions inside the Constitution. And you'll find in the Constitution all of the provisions you need to see why the Prime Minister will call an election, consistent with the requirements under the Constitution. As we have already announced, we have a budget on 2 April. And do you know what? It will be a surplus budget. It will be a surplus budget because, having inherited a rapidly deteriorating budget position from the Labor Party, we've been able to turn that situation around as a result of our hard work. We've been putting funding for the essential services of government that Australians expect on a sustainable foundation trajectory for the future. We'll continue to do our work for the Australian people for as long as the Constitution entitles us to do so.</span>

If the Australian people could see the sorts of questions that you are asking, let me tell you, they will throw you out. They will not entrust you with running the country if the best you can do is a question like that. It's a pathetic question. It is an absolutely pathetic question. Start focusing on the Australian people. Start focusing on policy. Start focusing on what is required to make our country stronger, to make our economy stronger, to create more jobs, to keep our country safe and bring Australians together. That is the sort of question that you should be asking. I can't believe that this question went through the tactics committee. I can't believe that Senator Wong would allow such a pathetic question to be asked.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Leader of The Nationals and Minister for Regional Services, Sport, Local Government and Decentralisation</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:46</span>):  Thank you, Senator Williams, for your question. Christmas should be a time when families celebrate, but this will not be the case for our farmers and the people living in the regional communities affected by drought. The drought is tough, and it will take many years for some of these communities to recover. Our government stands shoulder to shoulder with them with real support. This real support is only possible because the Liberal-National government has done the hard work to put our economy in a strong position so that at times of stress we have the fiscal ability to provide these essential services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Five years after coming into government, the Liberal-Nationals are ensuring that we have a budget that is coming back into surplus—rather than promise one, we deliver. We know that when our regions are strong, so, too, is our economy, and that's why we're backing our farmers and regional communities during this drought. Our government has provided $7 billion in support for our farmers and rural and regional communities in response to the drought. You can't do that, you can't deliver that level of support, without a strong economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's an $81 million extension to the Drought Communities Program to drought affected councils to employ locals; $30 million for farmers, farm workers and farm suppliers facing financial hardship because of the drought; $72 million to enhance a long-term water security strategy for Australia. We're committing to invest $100 million each year into a $5 billion Future Drought Fund, because we know that this will occur again and we need to be ready when it does, after the rains come. Because of good economic management, the Liberal-National government has been able to invest billions of dollars to support farmers and their communities in their time of need.</span>

We are unashamedly behind and backing regional communities. Today we've seen how those opposite want to treat regional communities and our industries. They nearly attempted to destroy a major agricultural industry, the $2 billion live export trade, and relegate it to extinction, along with the 10,000 Australians who are employed in it. It's very easy to sit behind the goat's cheese curtain, sipping your turmeric lattes, swilling your kombucha—very easy, because you've proved time and time again that you are no friend of farmers, you are no friend of agriculture and mining and you are no friend of regional Australia.

I refer to breaking reports in the Fairfax media that Senator Payne will be meeting with the Indonesian foreign minister, Retno Marsudi, on the sidelines of the Bali Democracy Forum. The Indonesian foreign minister warned that Mr Morrison's decision to junk longstanding bipartisan foreign policy and review the location of Australia's embassy in Israel was 'a slap to Indonesia's face'. Can the minister confirm she will meet with Foreign Minister Marsudi? Will the minister seek to undo the damage done by Mr Morrison's decision to put domestic political interest before Australia's national interest?</span>

It is the 11th Bali Democracy Forum, and Australia has been engaged in it for some time with a range of representatives. It is an important opportunity for us to both protect and promote the benefits of democracy with a wide range of nations. We know that Indonesia is the world's third-largest democracy, and we welcome their international leadership in advocating those democratic principles that we hold dear and highlighting the importance of democracy as part of the strategic agenda of our regions. I will be addressing the forum tomorrow and participating in it. I reject the premise of the rest of Senator Wong's question. It is a matter of record that I have met recently with Minister Marsudi in Papua New Guinea, on the sidelines of the APEC forum, and I will be meeting with her again tomorrow.</span>

The Liberal-National government has made real progress in ensuring the strength of the Australian economy. As Senator Cormann has articulated yet again today, we are on track to deliver a budget surplus on 2 April.</span>

                  </a>  That's taken hard work, Senator Macdonald, as you know. Our government's 2013 promise to put in place the policies to deliver one million jobs to Australians within five years was actually reached earlier than planned. Our unemployment rate is now at five per cent. It has fallen to five per cent. And, if you look at the percentage of working-age Australians on welfare, it has fallen to 15 per cent. This is the lowest rate of welfare dependency in over nearly a quarter of a century. But, on top of putting in place the right economic conditions to create jobs, what we are also doing—in response to Senator Stoker's question—is ensuring that we have in place programs that will support older Australians in need of a hand to stay in the workforce, or for those who are looking for new opportunities.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are looking at putting in place a skills checkpoint. We want to make sure that older Australians have access to the skills they need not only for the jobs of today but also for the jobs of tomorrow. And we are increasing support for older Australians to upskill or transition into new careers through our new Skills Checkpoint for Older Workers Program. Senators may be interested to know that the definition of a mature aged person is actually 45, so I think the majority of us in this place would actually be interested occasionally in looking at the Skills Checkpoint for Older Workers Program.

But what we are also doing, in addition to the skills checkpoint is, from 1 January 2019, we have the Skills and Training Incentive. If you qualify, you will go through the skills checkpoint and you will work with your program manager to identify a skill that you may require or you identify a training opportunity linked to your current job, a future job opportunity or an industry occupation or skill in demand, and you will be able to put forward and access up to $2,200 from the government to fund reskilling or upskilling opportunities, and this funding will be co-matched by either you, if you want to, or, alternatively, your employer. This is all about ensuring that older mature aged Australians have the skills the economy requires. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Participants will undertake individually tailored assessments of their skill levels. Skills checkpoint providers will then work with them to develop a career plan to assist participants to identify gaps in their skills, if they are wishing to transition into a new career or undertake a new role in their current occupation, or skills that they could develop or enhance to increase their capacity to perform in their current role. This is all about ensuring that the policies are in place to create the jobs and about ensuring we have the programs in place to support Australians so they have the skills they need for the jobs of today and of tomorrow.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:59</span>):  My question is to the Minister for Small and Family Business, Skills and Vocational Education, Senator Cash. I have recently met with representatives of emergency services organisations, including Surf Life Saving, Rural Fire Service and Marine Rescue, who expressed grave concern in relation to the government's changes to the assessment credential requirements for registered training organisations, including volunteer organisations. Has the minister met with these organisations to address their concerns and, if so, what steps has the minister taken to deal with their concerns?</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Time">15:03</span>):  I have a statement to make about events in the building this morning. Some senators will be aware that this morning a large number of protestors entered the building and proceeded to occupy the Marble Foyer. As a result of this, and for the safety of those visiting the building, the public entrance had to be closed. This disrupted the peaceful entry of visiting school groups, members of the public and tourists. As everyone is aware, there is an authorised assembly area at the front of this building specifically designated for groups to conduct their activities without causing disruption to the business of the parliament, those who work here and those visiting. The protesters, having failed to comply with a direction from attending police to move on, were removed without incident. The protestors have been advised that they have been banned from entering the precincts within the bounds of Parliament Drive for a period of three months, having behaved in a manner contrary to the requirements for visitors to Parliament House. </span>

                  </a>  I invite Senator McKenzie to remain, because I will make some comments about Senator Cormann's determination to enlarge the stick in question time. But, before we get to the reshaping of the big stick according to Senator Cormann, let's just see what Elizabeth Knight in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Canberra Times</span> had to say. The headline was 'Government's big stick energy policy now small twig'. The government has lost its big stick it was threatening to bludgeon energy companies with if they misbehaved on the power pricing. And why did they lose their big stick, which is trying to reappear as a giant stick now? Because the same thing happened to this energy policy as has happened to all the others. They didn't get it sorted out, they didn't get it agreed in the party and the party has basically rioted on them and said, 'The big stick doesn't work for us anymore'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is how the big stick policy was eloquently described by the man who I hope will be the next Treasurer of the nation, one of my fellow New South Welsh parliamentarians, Mr Bowen:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">This ridiculous policy, this Venezuelan-style intervention, this intervention in the economy which would chill investment, has collapsed under its own weight.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was poor policy and has been shown to be poor policy. The Treasurer and the energy minister have been humiliated by their own Liberal backbench. That's what happened to the big stick: it got shaved down to size. And, as much as Senator Cormann might come in here and declare that it's an enormous stick, I put it to you that, in fact, it's a splinter. It's a splinter that has come off their big stick. It's fallen apart. It's rested itself in the heart of the Liberal Party. It's another splinter not only in the sense of being yet another division between the members of this chaotic government; it is a festering sore, a self-inflicted wound—yet another one on energy policy, which this government is unable to manage in any shape or form—that is now lodged with a piece of the wood that didn't work from their big stick. They are going to have a very, very big problem with removing it before the next election.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that last week the government was delivering an energy policy in one shape or form. Today they tried to convey that the changes that were forced upon the energy minister and the Prime Minister by the backbench in their party room were refinements. What we saw, in fact, was that there was no refining. It was another about-face that was required because they simply don't know what they're doing. In fact, all the serious commentary about this very serious matter indicates that investment into energy in this country is fragile and very vulnerable right now because of the ongoing failure of this government to act with integrity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a lack of policy vision and a lack of adequate consultation, and yet they have the temerity to come into this place and pretend, continuing to repeat platitudes to the Australian people. They make comments such as, 'We really care about the price of electricity'. They've had five years to care, and in the course of those five years that they've been here every one of us who opens an electricity bill knows that the price of electricity has gone through the roof. It's because of their constantly failing iterations of energy policy. I find it hard to describe what they do even as 'policy'. They have 'energy statements' or 'energy intents' but certainly not anything powerful that's driving down the cost of energy. I just remind Australians that we're still waiting for the $550 that they promised us all a couple of elections ago when they were going to sort out energy policy then. This government cannot be trusted on energy policy any day. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BROCKMAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:10</span>):  As tempting as it is to get into the stick debate, I will avoid it. The Labor Party, as per usual, just wants to play the insider political games. Senator Cormann was very, very generous when he described the first question as a policy question. As usual from the Labor Party, it was an insider political question. That's all we've heard from the Labor Party in this place for the year I've been here. Policy questions from the other side have been as rare as a needle in a haystack.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This side cares about families' energy prices. We care about businesses' energy costs. I was at a meeting representing Minister Cash a few months ago and I met with a particular small-business person, the sort of enterprising individual who is at the core of the Australian economy—a small supermarket owner from South Australia. In the previous 12 months, he had seen his energy bill go up by $80,000 a year. Those opposite want to make jokes about energy prices, but $80,000 a year to a small business, a small IGA, means a very simple thing: it means laying off staff. It means less take-home pay for the owners of that business. It means fewer opportunities for young Australians to get a job in that economy. That is what we see as the outcome from the kinds of policies that are being touted by those opposite. They are job-destroying policies. That is what the business community is saying and that is what we and the Australian people know is the truth.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's policy on energy will destroy jobs. The government's policy on energy is designed to do one thing—to drive down the cost for consumers. Families and small businesses are all energy consumers. We have already seen significant progress in that area. We've already seen significant announcements from the energy companies. The plans that this government has on energy are already working. Five hundred thousand Australians are already getting a better deal, with Origin, Energy Australia, AGL and other companies lowering their prices by up to 15 per cent from 1 January. This is what this government is achieving for the people of Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite want to play politics and they want to make jokes, but they do not want to do the hard work in driving down energy costs for Australian families and Australian businesses. Their policies will do a very simple thing to the economy: they will destroy jobs. Jobs growth is so essential and it is one of the towering achievements of this government. We committed, on coming into government, to creating a million jobs—and that is just what we have done. We have put the settings in place to allow Australian businesses to create those million new jobs. The vast majority of them are full-time jobs. This gives people hope, this gives people opportunities and this gives people a chance to improve their lives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We see the unemployment rate is down to five per cent. We see youth unemployment is at its lowest level in over six years. These are the important statistics that say whether a government is on track and whether a government is delivering for the Australian people. This government is delivering for the Australian people. Female full-time employment rose strongly by 29,000 in the latest figures. It has increased by 3.7 per cent in the past year. It stands at a record high. These are the kinds of achievements that this government will take to the next election. The Australian people will understand that this is what matters to the economy: this is what will enable the economy to continue to grow as we return to surplus, as we pay down the debt we inherited from Labor and as we continue to put in place the preconditions necessary for Australians to have a full and secure economic future.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="247512" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator KITCHING</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:15</span>):  I rise to take note of answers given by Senator Cormann to questions today. Senator Cormann's evasions and non-answers in question time today revealed the complete shipwreck that is the Morrison government's energy policy. As Senator Cameron so frequently reminds us, the Morrison government is a total rabble.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've never seen that more starkly revealed than it was today when we looked at the next iteration of their energy policy—whether it's a big stick, a twig or a branch. Who knows what they're up to at the moment! I think we have to remember that, of course, Mr Morrison is only Prime Minister because the Liberal Party's climate-denialist wing, led by Mr Abbott, the member for Warringah, rebelled against the energy policy of the Turnbull government. It was that rebellion that led to the leadership spill which has made Mr Morrison Prime Minister.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But, of course, we've seen all this before, because, of course, when Mr Turnbull—if I can call him 'Turnbull 1.0'—was first the leader of the Liberal Party, he was undone on climate policy by Mr Abbott. He, of course, took the Liberal Party to the election and he was then himself replaced by Mr Turnbull, who was then himself replaced by Mr Morrison—again, on climate policy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know the current Prime Minister likes to compare the Liberal Party to the muppets, but I have another analogy that might be appropriate, and that is that when Mr Turnbull was Turnbull 1.0, he was the strongman at circus. But Turnbull 2.0 was the boneless wonder. But they are none of the things that Menzies wrote about. I happen to know from some of those opposite that they love it when I quote Sir Robert Menzies back to them. I'm actually going to quote the member for Goldstein, Tim Wilson—someone I know well. He quoted Menzies today on Twitter, saying:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… we have won because we have been the party of innovations. Not the party of the past, not the conservative party dying hard on the last barricade, but the party of innovations.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">He went on to say:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm not sure we could say that this is the party of Menzies!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But he did go on in that speech, a speech he gave on 12 April 1965—one might have thought the Liberal Party might have moved on from the sixties, but apparently not, and not in the way that some people haven't moved on from the sixties!—where he was looking at the history of the Liberal Party, and he said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Now the first thing we did, the thing that our opponents have not done, was to say, "Well, what do we learn from our vicissitudes?"</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">…   …   …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We said, "Now, here we are, despised and rejected " and we were, of course, at that time led by a leader whose political life was regarded by most people as finished.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Who does that remind us of today? He went on:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">So we had no great assets, either in the front or otherwise, but we made up our minds that we would come back, that we would unify ourselves that we would do the things that had to be done - forget about the past and say to ourselves, "We must have one party, full of unity and fire, and we must have a programme, a platform, which will make people understand that we have been thinking in the future,"</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that the sixties were a long time ago now, but I really don't feel the Liberal Party has learned from that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Victorian Liberal shadow Attorney-General, John Pesutto, today conceded that he had probably lost his seat of Hawthorn. Unless you know the electorates in the inner parts of Melbourne, you wouldn't know that it was a blue-ribbon absolute stronghold for the Liberal Party in Victoria. They have lost that; as he said, short of some miracle, he has lost his seat. He gave the very telling example of why the Liberal Party is suffering electoral defeat. He gave the example at his press conference of his 17-year-old daughter's decision to attend last week's climate change rally to illustrate the challenge the Liberal Party faces in ensuring that it can continue to appeal to a wide range of voters. The Liberal Party is, of course, in such a crisis and such a ramshackle state that, really, it's appealing to no-one. And today's energy policy changes tell us once again— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

In fact, I think about two minutes of a five-minute speech was taken up by quoting the great man himself. From a Liberals' perspective, of course, that's a wonderful thing. We love quoting Robert Menzies because we are so proud of the history of our party. We're so proud of everything that our side of politics has achieved in our past but we're also proud of what we're achieving today and what we are going to achieve in the future. And it is good hearts and sound minds, just like those of John Pesutto, the former member for Hawthorn—and I'm very glad to see that you have also quoted him today, Senator Kitching—that will take us forward to that grand future that has a vision as wonderful as does our illustrious past.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our energy policy, as anybody on the other side would know if they had been listening, has in fact been bringing prices down. It has been bringing prices down for the last—what? Years or months? I'm not entirely sure what it is now. The coalition has said from day one that it is committed to bringing power prices down and has already taken significant actions to do exactly that. You will recall that the first action that we took on coming to government was to abolish the carbon tax—the heinous carbon tax—introduced by the former government.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator HUME:</span>
                  </a>  Heinous! Abolishing the carbon tax has saved each household around $550 per year and reduced electricity bills by up to 10 per cent. We have also reined in the power of the electricity networks by abolishing the limited merits review introduced by, I think, the Gillard part of the Rudd-Gillard-Rudd government. If Labor had done that sooner, it would have saved Australian energy users over $6 billion. We've also secured better deals for at least 1.6 million households which have seen retail electricity prices come down in Queensland, South Australia and New South Wales on 1 July this year. We secured better deals for those 1.6 million households by negotiating directly with the retailers. And, in 2017, we provided $269 million for a one-off energy assistance payment to age and disability support pensioners, single-parent families and veterans. The payment was $75 for singles and $125 for couples.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But we have not stopped there. We are also now stopping the price gouging by energy companies with the big stick legislation, so lovingly referred to by those opposite, which was introduced to parliament just this week. We're providing customers with a price safety net to put customers back in charge and help those who don't have time to shop around. We're establishing a default price. A default price will provide relief from confusing and often expensive standing offers, and we're backing investment in reliable generation and encouraging more competition in the market. The energy market is no longer competitive. It is a broken market, and big players dominate the sector. We are increasing competition, lowering prices and guaranteeing reliable supply. The government will back new and reliable affordable generation. On top of that, we're supporting reliable power by requiring the energy companies to sign contracts guaranteeing enough energy to meet demand.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is the coalition's plan for affordable and reliable energy. For too long, power companies have put their own interests ahead of those of consumers. The coalition will no longer allow that to happen. We have a plan for affordable and reliable energy that is keeping prices down. Shall we have a look at Labor's energy policy? When will they learn? They will never learn. An ideological approach will not bring prices down, it will not keep the lights on and it will, in fact, cost jobs. At what point do you learn from South Australia's experience that a 45 per cent emissions reduction target and a 50 per cent renewable target will not only cost jobs; it will prevent prices coming down and it will keep you in the dark. Understand that Labor will tax your growth away, it will cost you your job and it will leave you in the dark. Only the coalition can be relied on to bring energy prices down. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="39801" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CHISHOLM</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:25</span>):  I think that speech sums up the coalition government. All they have on energy policy is a scare campaign. They have been in government for five years, and all they can come up with, three months before an election, is a scare campaign. Let's look at their record. Under their record, prices are up, emissions are up and reliability is down. That is what they have achieved from five years of LNP government. When they come before an election, they don't come with a policy; all they come with is a scare campaign. That's all they have got for the Australian people. We've had five years of inaction, chaos and dysfunction, and all they come up with now—I think Senator Abetz put it at the start of question time—is a fig leaf of a policy. That's all it is, because they cannot get any sensible policy through their backbench. Even this so-called big stick that they talk about is actually being attacked within the backbench. The ones who were attacking that have come from all cross-sections of the Liberal Party as a result of that. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that they've had the National Energy Guarantee. We know that they've had an emissions intensity scheme. We know that on every occasion the backbench have demolished that policy, so much so that they actually cannot settle a policy that they can take to the Australian people. There's a real cost to this, because the people who pay the price are Australian households. The people who pay the price are workers and businesses, because they can't get affordable electricity to run their plants and factories that so many people rely on for employment. This is their record after five years. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that the policy that they have put forward is under attack from the Business Council and the Australian Energy Council. The proposal that they have put forward, that they have struggled to get through their own caucus, is already being attacked by those people who are involved and have an interest in this. What they are trying to do is basically sticky tape a policy together to get them through an election and to stop a crossbench revolt. But we know from the experts that all it will do is reduce investment and push up prices. This is the latest iteration of a policy that they have on energy. All that is going to do is reduce investment and push up prices. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What's emerging as the real motive behind this policy, and this is evident, is privatisation by stealth. This is actually the aim of their divestment thought bubble. This will have a real impact on Queensland. It is a Liberal and Nationals obsession. We know that they pursued this in Victoria and we know the dire consequences that we've seen. We know the Liberals pursued this in South Australia and we know the dire consequences that we've seen as a result. We know that they pursued it in New South Wales. They have sold off electricity assets in that state as well. And we know that they've tried previously in Queensland, and it has only been the public and now a Labor government that has been able to stop them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that, when it comes to privatisation of electricity assets, the Liberals and Nationals will pursue every chance that they get. We know that this is actually the aim of the divestment policy that they're putting forward. We know this because only recently, today, have they given a copy of this legislation to the Queensland state government. They have been out there; other organisations have had the ability; but the Queensland government, which owns significant energy assets in our state, would not be given the legislation so they could understand the dire consequences that this would have on our state. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The LNP never give up on attempting to force this policy on Queenslanders, but Queenslanders—the voting public and the Labor government, and this Labor opposition—will absolutely stand up to them. What is really disappointing is that the LNP and the Queensland federal MPs like to position themselves as Team Queensland. They talk a very big game when it comes to Queensland; but on this issue they are silent. We know other backbenchers have talked about the dire consequences of this divestiture bill, but the Queensland LNP have absolutely been silent. We know that, at the end of the day, the Queensland LNP want to use this to pursue their privatisation objectives. The Labor opposition will absolutely stand up to them. We will ensure that Queensland electricity assets remain in the hands of Queenslanders. Queenslanders have voted repeatedly to ensure that that is the case. So we will call the LNP out on this. We will not let them pursue this ideological agenda.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Small and Family Business, Skills and Vocational Education (Senator Cash) to a question without notice asked by Senator Steele-John today relating to the Telecommunications and Other Legislation Amendment (Assistance and Access) Bill 2018.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's be absolutely clear: the encryption legislation which the government is seeking to bring through this parliament is one of the most flawed and one of the most dangerous pieces of legislation ever to make its way through this place. It is coming here on the back of a deal that has been done between the government and the opposition. On Friday I held out hope—perhaps a naive hope—that the opposition would be able to find itself a backbone and keep it for 48 hours. Well, I was proven to be mistaken. They couldn't even last that long.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reality is, in modern day Australia, when this Liberal government comes in here and says: 'Blah, blah, blah, something, something, national security. This is how high you must jump,' the opposition says: 'Well, of course. We'll get out of the way. We'll let it through to the keeper. Just don't accuse us, ever, of being soft on national security, because we can't take it.' You have never met something Peter Dutton dragged out of the depths of his mind that you weren't prepared to pass, and the result is a piece of legislation condemned by Australia's IT sector and tech sector, by the UN and by our own Human Rights Council as being a threat to the privacy of Australians and a threat to a $3.2 billion tech industry.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The President of the Senate rightly aired his concerns that this would, indeed, have the potential of infringing upon parliamentary privilege. I'm glad that he made those concerns known. However, I am not just concerned about the privacy of those in this place. There can be no doubt that, should this legislation pass, brought forth as it has been by a government which is technically illiterate and an opposition which is utterly spineless, if it comes to fruition then every Australian will be less safe because of it and the rights to privacy of every Australian citizen will be compromised.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You do not understand that which you are doing. You are following along blindly in the wake of public servants who have for years schemed, waiting for a minister and an administration stupid enough to put this legislation through. And haven't they found it in this government? But the key to the whole thing is an opposition weak enough to let it happen, and the result is legislation which will see Australia an outlier in the world, with one of the weakest, most decrepit systems of internet privacy protection in the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You don't understand what you're doing. You haven't stepped back and, as a result, we will all be harmed. When those hackers—those third-party entities for which legislation such as this is akin to the best Christmas present any government could gift them—do with these tools that which we know they are planning, when billions are lost, when private information is made public, then there will be no-one to blame apart from yourselves for your cowardice and your blinding stupidity.</span>

This is one of the last great strongholds of the Tasmanian devil and it contains one of Australia's largest temperate rainforests. And 270,000 people signing this petition shows the depth of feeling and the desire around the world for this beautiful part of Tasmania to be protected under World Heritage listing on behalf of all of humanity. Senator Whish-Wilson and I invite opposition leader Bill Shorten and Prime Minister Scott Morrison to come down to Tasmania, and we, along with members of the Tasmanian Aboriginal community, will show them around so they can see for themselves this beautiful area, thanks to Patagonia and former senator Bob Brown. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The purpose of the Bill is to protect sponsorship and licensing revenue from the International Cricket Council (ICC) T20 World Cup 2020 (T20 World Cup) from being undermined by ambush marketing, which is the unauthorised commercial use of event indicia (or expressions) and images. This will be achieved by including the T20 World Cup as a recognised major sporting event under the <span style="font-style:italic;">Major Sporting Events (Indicia and Images) Protection Act 2014</span> (the Act).</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill also takes the opportunity to remove schedules relating to two historical sporting events that are no longer provided protections under the Act, being the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) Asian Cup 2015 and the ICC Cricket World Cup 2015.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill is consistent with the approach the Australian Government took when it legislated to protect the indicia and images for the Gold Coast 2018 Commonwealth Games, AFC Asian Cup 2015, ICC Cricket World Cup 2015, Melbourne 2006 Commonwealth Games and Sydney 2000 Olympic Games. It also meets a commitment by the Australian Government to provide such intellectual property rights protection for the T20 World Cup.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The hosting of the T20 World Cup in Australia provides a unique opportunity to showcase our country to the world from a tourism, trade and event delivery perspective. It will further strengthen Australia's reputation as a world-class host of major international sporting events, with the Australian Government playing a critical role in facilitating the appropriate environment that makes such success possible.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The T20 World Cup will see the world's 10 best women's teams and 16 best men's teams coming to Australia to play Twenty20 cricket, with potential broadcast and digital audiences reaching in excess of 1.5 billion people from more than 200 countries worldwide. These T20 World Cup teams will represent the pinnacle of international sporting competition and include some of the world's most talented male and female cricketers. The women's T20 World Cup tournament will take place in February-March 2020, with the men's T20 World Cup tournament scheduled for October-November that same year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">For the owners and organisers of the T20 World Cup, this international profile provides the opportunity to showcase the sport of cricket, build a legacy and attract commercial partners that will invest in the event and cricket into the future. Event owners and organisers rely heavily on revenue generated by television rights, ticket sales, sponsorship and licensing to ensure their event can be delivered and continues to be an attractive and viable financial proposition to future host countries. It is this profile and these commercial realities that necessitate the sorts of protections that are proposed for the T20 World Cup in this Bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Major events have long been targets of those that would seek to create an impression of association with the event in order to achieve commercial gain without having purchased the rights and therefore invested in the sport, to claim that association. This act, known as 'ambush marketing by association', has the capacity to diminish the value of sponsorship, reduce the incentive for organisations to enter into commercial arrangements with events, and reduce the overall event revenue. In turn, this has the ability to increase the financial impact on government to support such events.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill will protect the use of a range of expressions associated with the T20 World Cup from ambush marketing and unlicensed commercial use in the lead up to, during and in the immediate aftermath of the T20 World Cup. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In addition to protecting specific event-related terminology, the Bill also provides protection to certain images that in the circumstances of their presentation suggest, or are likely to suggest, a connection with the T20 World Cup. These images may be either visual or aural representations. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">While it is important to protect T20 World Cup sponsors from ambush marketing, the rights of the community to freedom of expression must also be respected, particularly in relation to words that have passed into common usage. A pragmatic approach has been taken with generic words and references excluded from the list of protected expressions. It must also be emphasised that restrictions on the usage of T20 World Cup indicia and images will apply only to their unlicensed commercial use.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">A number of exceptions will exist in relation to the T20 World Cup allowing for:</span>

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-SmallBullet" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">the provision of information, criticism and review of the T20 World Cup, such as in newspapers, magazines and broadcasts; </span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-SmallBullet">communities and businesses to engage in city dressing and festival promotions supporting the T20 World Cup in non-commercial ways.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In line with the Australian Government's deregulation agenda, the Bill is not intended to increase the burden on business or affect their everyday operations. The Bill fully protects the rights of the existing holders to use T20 World Cup indicia and images to carry out their business functions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Corporations (Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander) Amendment (Strengthening Governance and Transparency) Bill 2018 introduces a range of technical reforms that will improve and strengthen the <span style="font-style:italic;">Corporations (Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander) Act 2006</span> (CATSI Act). More than 3000 corporations, and the communities they serve, will benefit from these reforms.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporations play a vital role in delivering services and supporting economic development in communities across Australia, particularly in regional and remote Australia. In 2015-16, the top 500 CATSI Act corporations had a collective income of $1.92 billion, more than double the overall income of Indigenous corporations since the CATSI Act commenced. The Bill will help those corporations serve their communities by cutting unnecessary red tape, and ensuring greater transparency and accountability of boards and senior executives. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Since it was enacted, the CATSI Act has improved the efficiency, sustainability and accountability of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporations. After eleven years of operation, it is important to update the Act so that it continues to be relevant to Aboriginal and Torres Strait corporations, particularly as they face new economic challenges. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In 2017, the Registrar of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Corporations commissioned an independent technical review of the CATSI Act. The review was led by law firm DLA Piper and included a series of public consultations conducted by the Indigenous consultancy firms, Inside Policy and Winangali. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Following that review, in 2018, the Registrar and his office conducted further consultations across Australia on the proposed amendments, and feedback from these consultations has informed the amendments in the Bill. The amendments have had a high level of scrutiny and consultation, and stakeholders have welcomed the changes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill comes at a pivotal point in the economic development of Indigenous corporations. Under the Government's Indigenous Procurement Policy over $1 billion in Commonwealth contracts has been awarded to over a thousand Indigenous businesses since its introduction in July 2015 from the Commonwealth alone, a significant increase from 30 Indigenous businesses winning $6.2 million in 2012-13. More Indigenous service providers than ever are receiving funding under the Indigenous Advancement Strategy (IAS). This growing movement to tap into the extraordinary capabilities of Indigenous businesses and not-for-profits brings with it a need for increased scrutiny and stronger governance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is important that the regulatory framework keeps pace with the needs of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporations as well as the best modern regulatory practices. The new Bill aligns the size classifications, and more importantly, reporting obligations of CATSI corporations, with both the Australian Charities and Not-for-Profits Commission (ACNC), and companies limited by guarantee under the Corporations Act. This will mean minimal reporting for over 78 per cent of CATSI corporations which will be classified as small, and streamlined reporting obligations for the nearly 30 per cent of CATSI Corporations that are also registered with the ACNC.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The CATSI Act is a successful regulatory framework because it demands high standards of corporate governance, but at the same time recognises the specific cultural requirements of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. Improvements to the internal governance framework of the Act will make it easier for members and directors to know and follow the internal governance rules, and be more engaged in the management of their corporations. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Registrar will be better able to support corporations by providing model rule books that can be used off the shelf, or modified to suit the unique circumstances of the corporation. This will make it easier for corporations to register under the CATSI Act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Modern business entities use a range of corporate structures to pursue economic enterprises, either on their own or jointly with others. This Bill removes a limitation in the current Act that prevents corporations from using these structures to their best advantage. By removing this barrier, the Bill reduces the cost of doing business and promotes the use of a variety modern corporate structures that can access the unique support and flexibility offered by registration under the CATSI Act. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Good governance does not happen by accident, and we need to strike a balance between putting the right protections in place, while not imposing unnecessary red tape. Meetings are an essential part of ensuring good corporate governance but many corporations struggle with the administration and cost associated with holding Annual General Meetings (AGMs).</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In recognition of the unique circumstances of CATSI corporations, the Bill introduces measures designed to reduce some of the regulatory and administrative burden associated with holding AGMs. However, reducing red tape doesn't mean giving a blank slate to corporations. Annual reports will still be required to be lodged with the Registrar who has the power to direct a corporation to hold an AGM should it seem reasonable to do so. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">For a corporation to work effectively, members must be both informed and engaged. The Bill allows corporations to harness the advantages of technology in managing and engaging with what is often a mobile and geographically dispersed membership, and dispenses with the outdated practice of publishing certain notices in print media.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">A persistent theme to arise from consultations was a call for strong accountability and transparency of senior management arrangements. Just as phoenix activity is a menace in the mainstream corporate sector, so too are those unscrupulous carpetbaggers who move from one remote Indigenous corporation to the next, enriching themselves at the expense of the communities they are supposed to serve. In line with current trends across the corporate, public and not for profit sectors, the Bill will shine a light on senior management appointments and benefits, giving rogue operators no place to hide.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporations are the lifeblood of many communities, and it is unsurprising that close kinship ties, and limited options for purchasing goods or services, can mean difficulty for corporations in meeting their regulatory requirements around issues like related party transactions. The Bill makes it easier for corporations to balance good governance with the desire to support Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander business. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Unique to the CATSI Act, special administration is one of the most effective tools the Registrar has to support corporations at risk. Minor changes to the provisions around special administration will make it easier for the Registrar to provide this support. In the same way, minor changes will make it easier for corporations to voluntarily deregister when the community no longer requires the corporation instead of the more complex and costly process of winding up.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The need for a strong and active corporate regulator with a broad suite of powers is undeniable in the current environment. The introduction of fines and enforceable undertakings, as well as investigative powers modelled on those of ASIC, will improve the Registrar's ability to support corporations as well as maintain the integrity of the Indigenous corporate sector. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">This is the first time significant amendments have been made to the CATSI Act in its eleven year history. The Bill makes good legislation even better. It strikes the critical balance between strong governance and effective regulation on one hand, and removing red tape on the other, so that corporations don't experience unnecessary barriers in delivering for their members and communities. Ensuring that Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporations are well governed is one key to meeting the challenge of reducing Indigenous disadvantage.</span>

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Climate change is destroying people's lives and livelihoods, through ever worsening and increasingly frequent heat waves, floods and droughts. Climate change is pushing many of our most vulnerable species and ecosystems to the brink of extinction. It will change the way we live our lives. The latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report, released in October of this year, once again reiterates that we must keep coal in the ground if we are to keep global temperature rise below 1.5 degrees. Staying under 1.5 degrees does not require new technologies to be developed to replace coal fired power - those technologies already exist. It does not require waiting for the cost of renewable energy to be comparable to the cost of coal fired energy - we're already there. Keeping warming to within 1.5 degrees is now just a matter of political will and leadership.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Galilee Basin (Coal Prohibition) Bill 2018 seeks to do exactly what the science is telling us is necessary - keep coal in the ground. This bill will prohibit all mining of thermal coal in Queensland's Galilee basin. This bill will prevent the disastrous Adani Carmichael mine from going ahead, as well as the eight other mega coal mines planned for the Galilee Basin. We know that if the entire Galilee Basin is developed it has the potential to add more than 700 million tonnes carbon dioxide (CO2) to the atmosphere each year. Australia currently emits around 400 million tonnes per year. If the Galilee Basin were a country, it would be the seventh highest CO2 emitter in the world, sitting just behind Germany and well above Canada and the UK. Allowing this basin to be opened up is both socially and environmentally negligent. The Galilee Basin is a giant carbon bomb. Over the lifetime of these projects, the coal that is mined would produce enough emissions to consume 7% of the world's remaining carbon budget. This drastic addition to global emissions has the potential to single-handedly derail efforts to avoid runaway climate change. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We haven't opened a coal basin in 50 years, and we shouldn't do so now. The Great Barrier Reef has just suffered repeated years of mass coral bleaching, which has led to 50% of the coral cover dying. This natural wonder of the world is at extreme risk from climate change, as are the 64,000 people who rely upon it for their livelihoods. As Professor Terry Hughes has said, we must choose between new coal or the Reef, we cannot have both.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Labor Party could stop the Adani Carmichael coal mine today by supporting this bill to end thermal coal mining in the Galilee Basin. We could have the numbers in the Parliament to immediately stop Adani and keep all the Galilee coal in the ground , but only if Labor has the guts to back our bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The real reason both major parties refuse to stop Adani is because of the millions in donations that they take from big fossil fuel companies in order to make sure that their decisions put their interests before yours. Labor, the Liberal and National parties have accepted $3.7 million in donations from the fossil fuel sector since 2013. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Labor party has recently claimed they cannot stop the Adani mine due to sovereign risk. This is a misplaced argument that the Labor Party invented to make it seem like acting would be too difficult. In fact the greatest sovereign risk to Australia is the risk of climate change. The cost of the climate crisis to our safety, our communities, nature, and our economy will already be immense and both the climate impacts and the costs would be turbo-charged by mines like Adani and others in the other Galilee Basin. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Leader of the Opposition, Mr. Bill Shorten won't show leadership because he's more worried about an attack from the coal mining companies and the Coalition than protecting our climate. And his party, like the Coalition, is hooked on the donations from coal mining and other resources companies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Digging up and burning coal is the single greatest contributor to dangerous climate change in the world. Just because these emissions will be on the books of whatever country we sell it to, this doesn't mean these emissions won't affect the climate just the same as if we burnt it here in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government could stop Adani by voting for this bill or by committing to a review of Adani's Carmichael mine approvals on the basis of new information about the company's conduct, and the state of the world's climate, that's come about since the approvals were granted.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Governments pass laws all the time that outlaw the mining or production of hazardous materials. This isn't reinventing the wheel. We didn't pay compensation when asbestos was outlawed. We didn't pay compensation to tobacco companies when we instituted plain packaging. We don't need to pay compensation if coal mining in the Galilee Basin is outlawed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This debate isn't happening in a vacuum - all around the world countries are moving away from coal because of the scientific consensus that we need to stop digging up and burning coal if we're going to prevent catastrophic climate change. The coal that Australia exports overseas is responsible for at least twice as much emissions as the coal we burn at home. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The human and environmental impacts of climate change are too high a price to pay so that a few companies can keep making billions of dollars in profits. Over the last few years we have seen unprecedented extreme weather events in Australia. Queensland is still battling over 100 bushfires sparked by the catastrophic heatwave conditions of last week. Bushfires aren't the only danger that heatwaves cause. Heatwaves in recent years around Australia have resulted in increased hospital admissions for kidney disease, acute renal failure and heart attacks, and in death. During severe heatwaves in January 2009, Melbourne experienced three consecutive days at or above 43°C. The death rate for that period was 374 above the average for that time of year, an increase of 62%. This is just one example of the human impacts of climate change - we're not just talking about just a few extra hot days a year or the jacarandas in my hometown flowering a few weeks early. We're talking about people losing their lives because of the vacuum of leadership on climate change in this country. We must keep coal in the ground; this bill is one way to achieve that outcome.</span>

                  </a>  The Australian government is committed to improving the lives of people living with dementia, their families and carers. The Australian government provides in excess of $50 million every year for dementia-specific programs. Providers of dementia programs and support undertake deliberate outreach activities to regional and remote areas. In the 2018 budget a further $5.3 million has been committed to pilot innovative technologies to improve care for people living with dementia. In addition, specialist dementia care units will be established in each of the 31 primary health network regions by 2022-23. The Australian government is committed to 200,000 million over five years to 2019 to boost Australia's research into the prevention, diagnosis, treatment and cure of dementia.</span>

However, the terms of reference of this inquiry would appear to prejudge that outcome. And with this government in its final months, we don't believe it is the time for a Senate committee to commence the kind of lengthy and detailed inquiry that would be required to properly consider the complex questions that the investigation of the broad terms of reference set out in this motion would require.</span>

                  </a>  The Greens are supportive of parts (a) and (b) of this motion. Many regional towns in Queensland are doing it tough. Social support networks and hubs have an important role to play in these areas. However, this motion calls for the burden of licensing fees of pubs and hotels to be reduced, and it's being moved by a senator who has accepted more than 190 bottles of wine and 21 cases of beer from the Queensland and Australian hotels associations over the past six months, and whose party has accepted more than $1.1 million from the gaming, alcohol and hotels industries over the past five years. The Greens cannot support a motion that advances the interests of that industry.</span>

                  </a>  Australia Day is an important national day. It is a source of great celebration for Australians but it is also a day of reflection. For First Nations people, 26 January speaks of injustice, dispossession and sorrow. On Australia Day we should acknowledge the British assertion of possession without the consent of First Nations people already here. Australia Day should give us pause to reflect on the need for truth telling about our history, the good and the bad. Hearing the truth is necessary if we are to heal the trauma and purge the guilt from our national sight. We need courage and integrity to face these ongoing matters for resolution.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor does not support changing the date of Australia Day. This is not to deny that our nation has yet to reconcile First Nations concerns. If elected in 2019, a Shorten Labor government will move quickly to agree to a process together with First Nations people to make the voice to parliament a reality, including a pathway to a referendum. Labor supports a voice and enshrining it in the Constitution as our first priority for constitutional change.</span>

Water is allocated to any user based on availability. In a wet year, when the dams and rivers have more water in them, more water will be available for use. In a dry year, the opposite happens: allocations are reduced. The way the plan has been established aims to specifically address climate change through 10-yearly reviews. The reviews are required; they aren't optional. This means that climate change and changes in patterns can be considered.</span>

                  </a>  Updating the regional broadband scheme modelling is complex because of the nature and number of inputs and steps. It is not a back-of-the-napkin calculation. The increasing cost for fixed wireless reflects the deficiencies in Labor's original plan to fix wireless that dramatically underestimated take-up and demand for data. It is not feasible to complete in a few weeks, and industry and consumers deserve certainty that any recalculation is thorough. The legislation already requires the levy to be regularly reviewed and adjusted on the basis of ACCC advice, subject to legislative protections. Those who want to secure long-term funding for the hundreds of thousands of regional premises that rely on fast broadband should support the legislation so a thorough recalculation can occur.</span>

                  </a>  Senators, can I have your attention for one second. Who in this chamber honestly, genuinely wants to sea whales slaughtered this summer in the Southern Ocean? Who wants to see the Japanese whaling fleet slaughter whales in the Southern Ocean? I think I can say that unanimously none of us do, and most of the Australian people don't want to see it either. For nine whaling campaigns, this boat, the MY <span style="font-style:italic;">Steve Irwin</span>, has gone down to the Southern Ocean and put the Sea Shepherd crew between the Japanese whaling fleet and Australian whales. All this motion asks is that this be recognised. The boat is about to be decommissioned and, in recognition of the service of the MY<span style="font-style:italic;"> Steve Irwin</span> and all the great work the crew has done over the years including taking on unregulated and illegal fishing very successfully. May I say that we call on the Australian government to uphold their election commitment and send a Customs vessel to the Southern Ocean this summer to twin the Japanese sailing fleet and let them know there are eyes on the water.</span>

As the Premier of Queensland, Annastacia Palaszczuk, has stated as recently as today, to those on the frontline and behind the scenes: thank you, you've done an incredible job. Labor extends our thanks to the dedicated volunteers from organisations such as Lifeline and the Red Cross, who are also working hand in hand with the state government to offer support to local residents and their families affected by the bushfires.</span>

                    </a>  The government opposes this motion. Taxpayers provide their information to the Australian tax office in the knowledge that its confidentiality is protected by law, except in a very limited number of specified circumstances. This motion will open the door to ever-present parliamentary speculation and inquiry into taxpayers' affairs. The Australian tax office can penalise taxpayers who do not lodge a return. The government has increased the penalties on large multinationals who do not lodge a return up to $525,000. Parliament enacted legislation prohibiting public disclosure of taxpayer information, recognising that disclosure of confidential information would be contrary to the public interest and would adversely impact ATO operations.</span>

What has happened here is the Senate has made an order, and the tax commissioner has had an opportunity to advance a public interest immunity claim. The Senate has considered that public interest immunity claim, and has decided the balance of the public interest lies in favour of compliance with the order. What is effectively happening here is the tax commissioner is saying no to the Senate after being issued with a lawful order, and that is not acceptable.</span>

Like many Australians, the Greens are appalled by the reports that are now coming in about the persecution of the Uygur people. There are images of mass internment camps. We're seeing pictures of surveillance devices tracking ordinary citizens' everyday movements. People are banned from going to mosque and praying. Australian citizens and residents are being detained in these so-called re-education camps. We know that the activities of Australian citizens here in Australia are being monitored. And thus far all we've got from the Morrison government is a mealy-mouthed response about how our consular officials are apparently raising concerns behind closed doors. We need a strong statement from this government condemning the human rights abuses going on in China right now. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a>  In line with the government's longstanding view, motions that cannot be debated or amended should not deal with complex foreign policy matters. The government remains concerned about human rights in several countries, including cases of arbitrary detention, and imposed restrictions on freedom of movement, freedom of religious expression and freedom of speech. Australia raised its concerns with China during the Universal Periodic Review of the United Nations Human Rights Council. The foreign minister reiterated those concerns to Chinese foreign minister Wang during her visit to Beijing. We continue to urge China and certain other nations to introduce meaningful human rights reforms.</span>

We are facing a test of our collective intelligence in the face of a threat to the existence of all life on Earth. We now know beyond any doubt that opening up new coalmines, new fossil fuel reserves like the Adani megamine will result in devastating climate damage and will result in a legacy left to future generations that no responsible community would inflict upon them. We know that we have, right now, the opportunity to stop this mine going ahead. Of course, the Liberal Party, dominated by climate deniers, are showing no signs of rising to the challenge that lies ahead of us. We know that both parties receive massive donations from the coal, oil and gas industries, and so we are not seeing the leadership that we should be seeing, not just here in Australia but on the international stage, from our parliamentarians. </span>

We know that if Bill Shorten and the Labor Party were to support our bill to prevent another new coalmine from ever opening up in Australia, that would be the end of this project; instead, they don't. They don't join with us and with so many Australian people like the young people who came to the parliament today to exercise their democratic right to protest against this megamine going ahead. They don't do it, and they cite the notion of sovereign risk as a reason for not being able to stop this mine. Well, what a lot of garbage! What a lot of rubbish! What a meaningless, hollowed-out term 'sovereign risk' is. It is thrown around by political parties who don't have the guts to take a stand when it really matters.</span>

Go and have a look at the foreign oil and gas companies operating in Nigeria or Russia or Turkmenistan or a dozen other countries with huge resources but very little rule of law and tell me that stopping a coalmine here in Australia is somehow going to drive investors away from investing in our shores. What nonsense. What garbage. No-one seriously believes that, if we were to tighten up our regulations around digging coal, around burning coal, it somehow would pose a threat to other operations in this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You see, risk is an inherent part of a capitalist system—the bigger the risk, the bigger the return. That is never truer than in the mining industry. In the mining industry, the huge rates of return come because there is risk associated with those projects. That is part of the reason why mining companies are so profitable, because they live with that risk every day. Governments pass laws all the time that outlaw the mining or production of hazardous materials. We are not re-inventing the wheel here. We didn't pay compensation to companies when we decided that asbestos was killing people, and we stopped it. We didn't compensate tobacco companies when we passed laws that said that we weren't going to allow tobacco to be consumed in the way it was previously consumed. We don't need to pay compensation. We are not creating any additional risk by stating the bleeding obvious. In fact, what we are doing is sending a very clear signal to other companies who are looking to invest in other areas or sectors that are harmful to our health.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We want to discourage companies from investing in businesses that harm the community. This is the right signal to be sending to the coal industry. Adani didn't just learn today that coal was harmful. We have known that for decades. The truth is that we need to come together as a nation and say, 'Your industry is now doing harm and it is time to stop it, to end it.' We don't see the action we need to see, because we see those millions of dollars flow into the coffers of both major parties. We see the Liberal Party dominated by climate deniers. Here we are, the first generation to feel the effects of climate change, the last generation to do something about it, and we are squibbing it. We have stop this megamine from going ahead.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:14</span>):  I can actually hear the frustration in Senator Di Natale's voice, and not just on this occasion; in fact, it's present in all of the Greens as they make contributions around coalmining. Their frustration is, of course, that they can't get anyone else to agree with them. Nine times out of 10, the majority of the Senate lets them sit over here, with their motions, where there is this lonely cohort of people—a very disciplined group, might I say, in supporting each other. I think it is intellectually offensive that nine people can vote the same way every time for hundreds and hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of votes—as we all know, from human nature, that's not possible. Their problem here is: the reason that their arguments don't resonate in the community is that they are simply based on false premises. We heard a very good contribution here the other day from Senator Williams, who happens to be in the chamber. It was a very good contribution. He laid it out as it is. He laid out the facts, laid them bare. If you were to compare his contribution to the Senate to the contribution just made by Senator Di Natale, Senator Di Natale would not have a single leg to stand on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's look at the impacts of what the Greens are having to say. They want to close down the entire coal industry in my home state of Queensland and, in fact, across the country—in fact, across the world; they'd be happy to do it across the world. Yet they have gone back to their offices now to work under the illumination of energy created by coal. It was overcast outside earlier, so solar wouldn't have been able to provide them with that energy. Of course, if the wind stops blowing, they'll be sitting there in the dark, which I don't think would necessarily be a bad thing for the nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Nonetheless, the contributions by the Greens around these matters are hypocritical. We have got a Greens senator who had their Senate office refurbished, and it was reported publicly that nearly $200,000 was spent on a timber floor in their refurbished office—not a tofu floor; not an old, dry, compressed grass floor; not an old leaf floor; not an urban floor but a timber floor. Both the electorate and chambers like the Senate are alive to this complete nonsense expressed by the Greens, and that's why they can't get anywhere. They can't get their motions supported here. Their motions fail one after the other.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I see three Greens senators here. My understanding of the polling is that only one of them will be here come a few months time.</span>

                  </a>  No, I'm not going to be here, but neither are you, and neither are you, Senator Hanson-Young. I suspect that Senator Hanson-Young will be ringing me up for a job. She can do a bit of back-burning on the farm; I'll have a bit of work for her there. She can catch a few possums so we can all get our protein levels up.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact of the matter is the Greens can't get the electorate to support them. They can't get the electorate across the country to support them. They can't get the Senate to support them. In the electorate, certainly in my home state of Queensland, there is an absolute wake-up to them. They can't get the Supreme Court to support them, and there have been 12 actions—not one or two or three or four but 12 actions. Their problem is the fact that they are not an honest cohort of people. They are a dishonest political party. For example, the other day we heard Senator Waters talking about the ILUA. We know that the Wangan and Jagalingou people in Queensland voted—listen carefully; I'll give you a second to pick your pen up—294 to one to sign the ILUA for the operation of these mines in the Galilee Basin. But if you go to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span> for Senator Waters's contribution the other day, you'll hear a different expression on it. Her contribution to it indicated that the native title, the people of that area, did not support the development of the mine.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They know what we know, they know what the Queensland electorate knows and they know what the national electorate knows—that the development of this mine and the movement of this coal will have zero impact on carbon emissions in the world. For the closing of the mine to have an impact, they would have to prove—and the proof, as presented by Senator Williams, is to the contrary—that these mines would stop, that these power generators overseas would stop. We know that is not true. What we do know is that they would rely on inferior coal that emits more carbon into the atmosphere than the high-quality coal that will come out of the Galilee and what already comes out of the Bowen Basin.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact is that when colleagues from the Greens party make their contributions they really think that everyone is as dumb as dog-doo. They just sit there, listen to this persistent drone that comes into their ears and think, somehow, that if they say it often enough, if they make misrepresentations frequently enough, people will adopt it as being the truth. The electorate and the chamber haven't been tricked on this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the things that always amuses me with the contribution from the Greens is the fact that they ignore what might be the alternative for 186,000 jobs that rely either directly or indirectly on the coal industry and the 40,000 or 50,000 more that will come with the development of Galilee.</span>

                  </a>  'Jobs on a dead planet,' I'll take that interjection. What they're going to do is take all the coalminers and close down Mackay, Rockhampton, Moura, Moranbah, Blackwater, Emerald—just close those towns down; just turns the lights off. The economic impact is not only on my home state and the nation but on all those hundreds of thousands of people. They'll have them polishing wind turbines. That's the alternative industry, these wind turbines. These are turbines made of steel that are smeltered from iron ore. There's an estimate—I don't have it in front of me; otherwise I'd quote it more precisely—that it takes about five years of generation before they've offset their own carbon footprint with respect to their structure.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To anybody listening, sadly—I hope that most Australians have a life and are not sitting glued to a television set listening to the tripe that comes out of our colleagues here—all I ask them to do is this: go back over the contribution of Senator Waters or Senator Di Natale or Senator Whish-Wilson or any one of the clan and pick three facts that they've stated in their contributions. They could be today's contributions, yesterday's or those from a week ago. If you're having trouble, contact my office and I'll provide you with both their contribution, their statements of facts, and the science that they plead about so frequently. And you can do your own comparison. I'm not here to tell you what to think. I'll provide you with the facts and you can make your own decision. I promise you that you'll arrive at the same place as so many in this place and so many in the electorate have—that this is nonsense and hogwash.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The problem is that their resistance to these matters, I believe, inhibits the ability for governments to properly engage in the debate around some of these issues and settle at some middle ground with respect to some of the policies—not just of the government but when and if, at some future time, the opposition takes government. So I urge people to watch and listen, and I urge them to be very careful. This tail over here, this tail of the Greens, is going to wag this Chihuahua over here if the Australian people make the mistake of putting them back in to govern this nation. I call on people to be very careful with how they apply their vote.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:24</span>):  In 2014, the warmest recorded year in human history, this government made Australia the first country to go backwards on climate change. Nothing has improved since. In fact, I would dare say things have got worse, as our emissions since 2011 have continued to rise. It has been made very clear by the Clean Energy Finance Corporation in their annual report this year that Australia will require declining—not increasing, but declining—emissions in every sector of economic activity in order to achieve its Paris commitments at least cost. That, of course, means new investment in large-scale renewable wind and solar energy, not new investment in new coalmines.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What has been made very clear since the toppling of the former Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, is that there are so many in government who simply do not believe in climate change, deny that it is happening, do not understand global warming perhaps or just want to at least reject the science. I say that based on information received just yesterday from the former Prime Minister himself. He said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">There is a significant percentage of the Coalition members who do not believe climate change is real, who think we should get out of Paris … who would rather the government, instead of building Snowy 2, built a new coal-fired power station.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There you have it from the horse's mouth. That's from the former Prime Minister. It shows exactly why we have no action on reducing our emissions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to this particular proposal put forward by the Adani company with another idea to build a new coalmine, admittedly a smaller sized one, I think we all need to be made aware, firstly, that global coal demand fell by two per cent only a couple of years ago and the year before that. The International Energy Agency finds that meeting the Paris climate targets means the coal trade will shrink 25 per cent by 2025 and that new coalmines are not needed. The Australia Institute has done a lot of work in this regard.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I made my position very clear very early on in relation to Adani's first proposal. I made clear my opposition to it. In doing that, I also met with various stakeholders. One of them was the Stop Adani Alliance. The Stop Adani Alliance, as we know, is made up of some 40 different organisations. Those different organisations include the Australian Conservation Foundation, who surveyed the Australian population. This was on 1 February this year. They found that nearly three-quarters of Australians, some 73 per cent of Australians, support a policy to halt the expansion of coalmining and to fast-track solar power and storage to reduce the threat of climate change. That shows you the position of the Australian community. That shows you what the Australian community are wanting.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to the coalmine that Adani is now proposing, I still remain, as my colleagues on this side of the chamber do, very sceptical about this proposal. We have to look back at what this company's projections were in the past in relation to jobs. That shows clearly that what they were claiming was incredibly unrealistic. It was simply fake. It wasn't true. It was telling that there was not one bank that wanted to invest in this project. Not one business wanted to invest in this project. I think that is because banks, businesses and the business community understand that we have gone beyond peak demand for coal globally, as referred to in that International Energy Agency report. Most of them do understand we have gone beyond peak demand for coal. That is the economics. We know that the economics didn't stack up. We know that the jobs didn't stack up. On top of that, some of those stakeholders I met raised a number of outstanding environmental issues, particularly in relation to what happened in the past with this company's behaviour around water sampling.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This company doesn't have a great track record of behaviour. I'm sure many people in this place saw the <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Corners</span> report into what occurred in India and what happened to the community and the people in India after a certain project by this exact same company. We have said all along that this has to stack up environmentally and economically, and I do not believe it does. Therefore, it remains a project that has very little support from me, from the community, from the business sector, from the banks—the list goes on. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I did want to highlight, though, that, when we're talking about this whole downturn in peak demand for coal, there is still a need for energy, there's still a need for electricity, there's still a need for all of that, but it has to be clean, and that is where Labor has such a fantastic policy. We have an energy policy. We have a climate change policy. We have a policy to deal with just transition. These are the things that this government has absolutely nothing of. Now, why do we have a just transition policy? We have a just transition policy because we care for workers, be they workers who are working in the coal industry or workers who will need jobs in that sector in the future. It is inevitable that there will be the closure of coal-fired power stations, because many of them are already operating beyond their original lifespan. Therefore, it is inevitable that we need a just transition for workers and communities to support those who will be affected when those coal-fired power stations close.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Seventy-five per cent of coal-fired power stations are already operating beyond their original design life. It is impossible for these to continue to stay open. They cannot stay open forever. Therefore, it's completely irresponsible for the government to play politics with this and to pretend otherwise. These coal-fired power stations are going to close. It is a fact. If those opposite want to bury their head in the sand and not understand climate change, not want to embrace the science, not want to accept the fact that these coal-fired power stations have to close, be it on their heads, because they are giving those workers in those communities no support in having that attitude. We must have a plan to help those workers and communities respond to those future closures and that is why we have a just transition plan.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, this company, Adani, has made a lot of fake announcements and broken a lot of promises. Labor has a policy for real jobs in Queensland. We want to build critical jobs-creating infrastructure, like roads and port upgrades. I think it is really important that no government puts all of its eggs in one basket. There is no silver bullet when it comes to jobs. There needs to be a diversification of jobs, there needs to be a just transition plan, and there needs to be action on climate change and clean energy. That is why Labor backs investment in renewables, in solar, in wind, in hydro. We are setting a goal that, by 2030, 50 per cent of our energy mix should come from renewables. That's exactly why those students protested the other day—because that's what they want to see in a government. They don't want to see a government like we have currently—living in the dark ages, wanting to build new coalmines, thinking that there is no such thing as global warming. Wake up and get in the 21st century.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WATERS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:34</span>):  Earlier this week the parliament finally took a stand on Adani. The President took it into his own hands to make a ruling about Adani. Do you think it was about Adani's mine? No, it was about me wearing, 'Stop Adani' earrings. It is tragic that this parliament decided not to stop Adani's mine, but to stop Adani's earrings. That is unfortunately the quality of the debate that we see about climate science in this chamber. No doubt the contribution to follow mine will have that same tenor of an absolute 'bozone' layer between facts and science and those on the opposite side of the chamber.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was interesting that it was raised that Adani have got 180 conditions, and therefore it's all going to be fine, because they've got these conditions written down. They have just been investigated by the federal environment department for breaching those conditions. They are being prosecuted by the Queensland government for breaching state conditions. They have a litany of overseas examples where they have breached overseas environmental conditions. They are now being sued, as is the federal environment department, for not following the right process in granting environmental approvals. So the whole process stinks. The company's track record stinks. The climate disaster that it would create if it were ever to go ahead stinks. The fact that it's being done because the company and other coal and resource companies make donations to both sides of politics stinks worst of all.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's why I'm proud that today I introduced a bill that would stop Adani, and it would stop the eight other mega coalmines that are proposed for the Galilee Basin. We had the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change release their report just last month, begging humanity to stay within 1½ degrees of temperature rise. We've already seen the impacts of the extreme weather being turbocharged by climate change. If we keep pumping more coal into the system, if we open up the first coal basin in 50 years, the other half of the reef will die and we will see more of those extreme weather events that make people suffer.</span>
              </p>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator WATERS:</span>
                  </a>  I would hope that Senator Macdonald doesn't find amusing the fact that much of Queensland is still on fire from the extreme heatwaves and the catastrophic fire rating that we have never before seen. But he's still laughing. Anyway, be that on his own head.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm very proud to have introduced that bill. I won't expect support from the other side and, frankly, I won't expect support from Labor, either, because their latest contribution on the Adani coalmine has been to say that, because it will be burnt overseas, it's somehow not Australia's problem. We don't share the same atmosphere, do we? Australia has got its own atmosphere that's not connected to the rest of the planet, so it's totally fine to burn the coal from Adani's coalmine because it is not on Australia's books, so it's not our problem. Well, please, find a better excuse.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So they did find a better excuse. The next one was that there would be a sovereign risk to Australia if the mine weren't to proceed. Now, that sounds like a very fancy sort of phrase, but it means very little. It means investor uncertainty. I hope that Adani does have investor uncertainty. In fact, they've pretty much had that because no-one will invest in their project. They've had to self-fund because no-one else can see this as a decent investment. They know the science is real, they know the Indigenous communities don't want this and they know there are better options to keep the lights on, which Senator Macdonald might like to look into. So this sovereign risk argument is the latest in a very long line of pathetically weak excuses from the so-called opposition as to why they won't get off the fence and simply say that this coal should stay in the ground and why they won't listen to the majority of Queenslanders and Australians who can see that clean energy is the way forward. It's good for our economy, it's good for our communities, it's good for our health and it's good for the health of our planet. I wonder what excuse we'll see next week.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Do you know what it all boils down to? It boils down to the $3.4 million that both sides of politics have received from resource companies in the last four years. That's the thing that stinks most of all. We have the science that is absolutely clear. We are already seeing the effects of the climate crisis that we are driving, and you folk want to continue it because you're taking the money from the coal companies. Shame on you. It's about time that you gave back the dirty money, you started listening to the science and you didn't protest that somehow having 180 conditions—some of which have already been breached—is going to make everything okay or that Australia has got its own atmosphere, so it's all going to be okay. Please do better. We are actually in charge of the future of the planet's atmosphere here, and if you take the right decision we all might have a liveable future.</span>

                  </a>  As bad as that is for the Labor Party, you'll notice yet again for the second time in a debate on coal and Adani in two days, where are the Queensland Labor senators in this debate? On our side, Senator O'Sullivan and I are putting the case because we are Queensland senators. We understand jobs. We understand what it means for the Queensland economy. We understand what it means for Queensland workers. We understand what it means for the bottom line of the budget of the Queensland state Labor government, and so do the Labor senators here. They understand how important Adani is, and that's why you won't see them within cooee of this debate. I can appreciate that, and I thank them for at least not showing the hypocrisy, as members of the Labor Party in Queensland at state level have by agreeing with Adani, issuing permits and approvals—not just for Adani but for other coalmines as well. I appreciate not having the hypocrisy of joining federal Labor down here who are suddenly opposed to Adani and coalmining.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You don't need to remind too many people about Mr Shorten going to the Batman by-election in the south of the country, right down in the bottom of the country in Victoria, telling everyone before Batman he was opposed to Adani. Then, of course, a few days later he was up in Queensland, in Townsville, telling everyone how good all the jobs were that Adani was creating. That's the sort of hypocrisy you get from the Labor Party, which supports the old adage that I've mentioned previously.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As bad as the federal Labor Party is—I think people understand the hypocrisy of the Labor Party—the Greens are yet another question altogether. Not only do the Greens political party tell untruths, not only do they deceive, but they deliberately go out and tell lies about anything related to the environment. What you've seen today in this debate is another classic example of that. 'Forget about the facts. Work on the basis that if you repeat it often enough schoolchildren and those who live in the leafy suburbs of Melbourne and Sydney will eventually agree with you, because if you say it often enough they think it's true.' </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Everything the Greens political party speaker said earlier is simply an untruth. The coalition government does understand the climate's changing, and, as I often say, once upon a time, Australia was covered in ice. Once upon a time in a later eon, the centre of Australia was a rainforest. Have a look at it today. Clearly the climate has been changing since the planet was created.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We on this side are accused by the Greens political party—deliberately misleading the Australian public and anyone who might be silly enough to listen to the Greens political party—that we don't believe the scientists. Well, I keep inviting Senator Waters to explain this to me but no-one in the Greens political party ever will because there isn't an answer. I keep saying to the Greens political party, 'I follow the scientists'. In fact, I follow the Chief Scientist. In an estimates committee on 1 June 2017, I put to him: 'If we reduce the world's carbon emissions by 1.3 per cent'—which is Australia's emissions as a percentage of the world carbon emissions—'what impact would that have on the changing climate of the world?' Dr Finkel answered, 'Virtually nothing'. So Senator Waters will tell you we don't trust scientists and we don't listen to scientists. Have a look at what the Chief Scientist said. Nothing we emit from Australia is going to make any iota of difference to the changing climate of the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Waters said if we allow coalmines to happen, the other half of the barrier reef will be dead. She knows that's not right; she is not that stupid. The Greens keep propagating these lies to children, kindergarten children, people who teach them. I have a great concern about our educators who peddle this misinformation. And Senator Waters keeps trying to convince people on a broadcast day—as though, if she says it often enough, it will suddenly get through—but it's simply untrue. It's a deliberate misinformation. We believe what the Chief Scientist says.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I continually point out, Australia is one of the few countries in the world that's actually met its emission reduction targets. We did far better than we were required under the Kyoto protocol and we're well on track to meet the commitments we've made in the Paris agreement. So we're doing our bit; other countries aren't. And yet the Greens political party, in a most un-Australian approach, keep blaming Australia for killing the barrier reef, when nothing we do in Australia will make one iota of difference to that. Read what Dr Finkel said.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the lies continue. She said the other half of the barrier reef would be dead. Well, it's not the other half. The barrier reef is doing very well because of fine management by the Commonwealth and Queensland governments, by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, by the Australian Institute of Marine Science and, dare I say, with some slight hesitation, by the James Cook University scientists—some of them understand; some of them get a bit tied up with the Greens political party, I think. The majority of opinion is that the reef is doing well. It will continue to do well. It will continue to attract tourists from all over the world and continue to provide jobs for Australian workers. Yet the Greens political party, as they always do, want to denigrate Australia, knock Australia down, kick Australia in the guts. Senator Waters, the Greens political party and federal Labor—not Queensland Labor—want to throw the jobs of those workers who make their living out of tourism on the barrier reef or who manage the coalmines, manage the railway systems in the mines to the wolves.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I noticed Senator Singh repeats the rhetoric that's now coming through, and I can see it here—the CFMEU have got on to them. The CFMEU said to Mr Shorten, 'Hey, hang on, these are our jobs that you're opposing.' So now we have this rhetoric from the Labor Party of a transition plan to transition workers out of the coalmining and railway industries. I'm not sure what they're transitioning into. Perhaps we expect them to become tourist guides, which I think would be interesting for some of the coalminers I know. Perhaps we're going to get them to be cyberexperts but that's not their job. They're very qualified, very professional miners and they should be allowed to continue their jobs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we're concerned about in the Morrison government are the consumers. That's why we want a mix of electricity energy: some from renewables, some hydro, some pumped hydro and a lot of coal, because coal is the cheapest. It's readily available, and Australian coal is clean by world standards.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're interested in the jobs of the union members that the Labor Party should be looking after. I'm pleased to say that in Queensland they are; federally, Mr Shorten doesn't give a damn about them. And we're also trying to address the poverty in India, which we often hear the Greens, in their hypocrisy, talking about—the poor people around the world and how Australia should be doing more. Here is an Indian company wanting to send coal to India to—heaven forbid! Do what?—give those poor Indians some of the electricity that Senator Waters enjoys every day of her life. But don't give it to the poor people in India! 'Let's stop the export of that coal because we really care about the poor people in India. They should stay in poverty without electricity.' That's the Greens' hypocrisy. That's the absolute disdain I have for those in the Greens political party who set out deliberately to mislead the Australian people.</span>

                  <a href="204953" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator GALLACHER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:50</span>):  I too rise to make a contribution in this matter of urgency: 'The stopping of the Adani coalmine poses no sovereign risk to Australia and we must show leadership to address the great challenge of climate change.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We always have to take issue with the some of the contribution in the first couple of minutes from Senator Macdonald. I can always dispense with half a page of my notes after his contribution. But I think the Labor Party has been exceedingly clear on this. There have been three public statements, from the Hon. Bill Shorten, from Hon. Tanya Plibersek and Senator the Hon. Penny Wong, saying that we're not in the business of ripping up proper, well-made approvals. No country, and especially not a country like Australia, will profit by ripping up agreements that have gone through the appropriate environmental checks, state and federal, and which have had the scrutiny of the marketplace. If this is a bad deal, then the marketplace won't provide the capital. And, if it's a bad deal, then I'm not sure that Adani would be putting its own money in to do the deal. I think those things should be on the record.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's just have a look at this risk to sovereign risk. Australia's export mix continues to be dominated by minerals and fuel. If we look at the combination, it's basically iron ore and $54.3 billion worth of coal. I have had the great honour of travelling on parliamentary delegations in my short time in this place, and I have seen a steel mill—a boutique steel mill—in Taiwan that had in its reserve stockpile 750 million tonnes of Australian coal. It had a four-kilometre long wharf which had mooring facilities for ships to come on every tide, 24 hours a day, seven days a week and 365 days a year. I said, 'My goodness, this is a production capability that's quite large.' They said, 'No, no, Senator, we're a boutique steelmaker.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, if we were to look at the steelmaking that goes on in Japan, Korea, China and other places in ASEAN, it's all fired by coal. It may seem to the Greens political party that we should just bump Adani off the map and not allow them to use their own capital or borrowed capital and not allow them to go through a process of state and federal environmental approvals and just say, 'No, you're not allowed to do it,' but what signal would that send to the other people in the industry who have invested to the tune of $54.3 billion? It would be catastrophic to Australia's sovereign risk. And yet the leader of the Greens said that it's no big deal! 'It's no big deal; you can just bump Adani off the map, don't let them do it and it'll have no effect on the second-largest export that Australia has.' Coal was 14.5 per cent of our exports in 2016-17 and iron ore was 17 per cent. And they're intertwined.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I accept that there's a debate. I find it exceedingly ironic that this is coming from the Greens political party, which had the chance in previous parliaments to agree with the Labor Party and put in some sensible pricing to send proper signals to the market place about what we should be doing about climate change. They threw that out. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we heard the disgraceful contribution, alleging corruption and impropriety, from Senator Waters. It is the lowest form of debate if all you've got is to say—</span>
              </p>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator GALLACHER:</span>
                  </a>  I don't get up every time and mention Mr Wood or Wotif or $1.3 million. If they're able to get someone to donate $1.3 million to them, good luck to them—as long as it's disclosed and we all know it. But I don't say that he has bought their organisation lock, stock and barrel and that he tells them what to do. I don't say that. I could, but I don't. But for them to get up and say donations from minerals companies, exploration companies and the like to the major parties is corruption is I think a very low standard of debate. We don't need that low standard of debate in this chamber, and we don't need Senator Macdonald's allegation of lies and the rest of it. I doubt that that will change in the short couple of hours we have left before the end of this parliamentary sitting year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I do agree with Senator Macdonald's contribution with respect to where this coal may end up and what it may do. There are still 31 million Indian homes without electricity. Base-load power is nuclear, hydro or coal. They're the three cheapest alternatives. It's probable that in a large country like India they've got a bit of nuclear and a bit of hydro, but they look to be needing a lot of coal. As a base-load power generator it's cheap. It's 50 per cent cheaper than gas. If Australia's investment in coal-fired power stations is falling—because they're all antiquated, would cost too much to revamp and people are looking at new technology in gas-fired plants—so be it. The market will make that decision. Intriguingly, this federal coalition government seems to be the most interventionist Liberal government in history, to be actually contemplating—not a big stick—a giant stick. That was Senator Cormann's contribution: a giant stick of intervention. More to the point, this is a grave sovereign risk.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Leader of the Opposition, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and the shadow spokesperson for foreign affairs are clear and unequivocal, on the public record, that we would not change properly constituted arrangements if we were lucky enough to be in government in the near future. There couldn't be anything clearer than our position. If he looked at the size of the contribution that coal makes to our economy, Blind Freddy could see that interfering with a properly constituted market-delivered project would send a catastrophic message to those who are currently invested in coal exploration or coal excavation and export. It would be catastrophic for our sovereign risk. Don't take it from me; take it from a former secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Mr Varghese, whose famous saying was: 'Australia can neither bully nor buy its way in the world.' Australia needs rules based order. It needs WTO rules. It needs rules around sovereign risk. It needs to be an exemplar to attract investment into this country. If we were to pull levers ad hoc, in the manner that the Greens are suggesting, it would be absolutely catastrophic for the export income of this country, not to mention catastrophic for Queensland in terms of jobs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Whatever the Greens actually believe, and that's sometimes very hard to put your finger on, they should believe that people who lose their job won't vote for them. This tactic of encouraging people to wear a button and say, 'Stop Adani,' as if that's going to be the talisman of a healthier world, couldn't be further from the truth. I want my grandkids to grow up on a clean planet. I grew up in places where when we burned coal it came straight down again and landed on the building, where people came out of coal mines and took two days to get clean, where pit ponies would come out of the mines blind and we used to ride them. You may have heard of those stories, Mr Acting Deputy President Williams. But we're a lot cleaner and we're a lot better now, and we will not move away from coal in the short term. There will be levers pulled that make sure that perhaps we don't build a coal-fired power station in Australia—that's fine.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that there's been a slight diminution in the exports of coal; it's down 3.6 per cent in 2017-18. But it would be absolutely catastrophic to take advice from the Greens political party in such an ad hoc, ill-considered and ill-thought-out manner—to put in jeopardy our second-biggest export and to put in jeopardy all of those jobs that are in that sector by singling out one proposition, which has to meet the hurdles of the marketplace, the state approvals, the environmental approvals and any federal approvals that are required. And there will be not a cent of taxpayers' money in it. That's the Labor Party's commitment: not one cent of taxpayers' money. If you're going to do this, it stacks up on your own: you build your own railway, do your own sums, do your own costing, get your own finance and, if it all stacks up, then you go ahead and do it.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:01</span>):  'I believe that we will win. I believe that we will win. I believe that we will win.' These were the words so beautifully sung out in the halls of parliament today, as young people from across this nation sat and exercised their right to protest in our very parliament to call attention to the reality that, when it comes to Adani, the choice is clear: it is between this megamine and the future of our generation. I was proud. I was proud to sit with them in their action. I was proud to sing with them, to cheer with them, to hear their stories—they, the young people of this nation, who must be, who have every right to be, a focus of the work of this place. They came today, as they came on the weekend, to demand from us, their parliament, their leaders, their representatives, action to ensure that their future is made safe for them, that an environment is passed to them which is liveable and clean. They came to us, demanding that we ensure that their future is not blighted by dirty rivers and nor is it the site of the deathbed of the reef. They came to us demanding that we put their future, their dreams, their hopes and their aspirations above the coal barons and the gas merchants and the desires that they peddle in this place. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">So few in here were brave enough to meet with them. So few in here were wise enough to heed their call. But I am proud to sit here as a member of a movement which not only met with them but celebrated with them, which held their hands and joined in union with their demand for action on climate change. I could look them in the eye and say that we, as a political organisation, are willing to put their future, the safety of the next generation, ahead of winning the next election cycle or taking the next fossil fuel donation. I was proud to say that I am a member of an organisation within which is Senator Waters, whose campaign is to end Adani, to get its filthy carcass off the body of Australia and drive out the political donations which have greased it into existence. I was proud to say that our organisation has such members among it. I was proud to say that we welcome young people, that we feel our existence to be one which is dedicated to the celebration, the empowerment, of young people—something I know firsthand as the youngest member of the Senate. </span>

I dedicate myself tonight to the service of my generation, to doing every single thing in my power to see that our movement for climate justice succeeds and that the future is one in which young people are able to thrive. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:06</span>):  If the Greens want to talk about sovereign risk, then I'm happy to talk about sovereign risk, because there is no greater risk to this country than the Australian Greens. Right now, the streets of Paris are burning because the French government has implemented some of the ideas that the Greens are pushing for here. The Chief Scientist of Australia told the Senate in June last year that reducing carbon emissions by 100 per cent would make virtually no difference to the global climate. It's a wonder that the Greens want to push this, but they won't listen to or raise the facts stated by the Chief Scientist of Australia. I'll repeat it: reducing carbon emissions by 100 per cent would make virtually no difference. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor and the Greens plan to ignore the advice of the Chief Scientist of Australia and embark on a plan that will destroy the living standards of most Australian families, by driving the living standards down to those of Third World countries. The people are crying out, and we need to listen. If the other politicians in this place keep ignoring the people of Australia, one day they will wake up and find the streets of Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane looking a lot like the streets of Paris, because people are fed up. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The scariest thing about hearing the Greens talk is how much they sound like Labor, and heaven help us if Labor get their way on energy policy. Labor's promise is to reduce carbon emissions by 50 per cent by 2030, but they have been coy about how this will be achieved. Labor's promise to create a just transition authority recognises that hundreds of thousands of workers will find themselves out of work as a result of Labor's energy and climate policies. Do I need to remind Labor and the Greens that governments don't create sustainable jobs? Labor's record of troubled schemes is legendary.</span>

                  </a>  You want to listen to all this! This is what Labor did. There's the home insulation scheme that wasted $2.4 billion, or what about the Building the Education Revolution? They were great policies but they wasted $16.2 billion and saw money spent on schools that closed a short time later. I love this one: the cash for clunkers scheme. It wasted $430 million. It was supposed to be a good idea for pensioners. And there's the set-top box scheme that wasted another $308 million. The promise made by Bill Shorten this month, that no-one will be left behind—doesn't it sound good? It sounds wonderful, but it's as hollow as Bob Hawke's promise that no child would live in poverty. Today, 17 per cent of children in Australia live in poverty. In fact, ads are going on TV to support those children who are living in poverty in our own country. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor have a long history of selling out workers. I'm thinking of enterprise bargaining agreements and Labor's recent failure to support personal tax cuts for working families. To hear Senator Cameron say today that the 1,630 apprenticeship places One Nation has put up are going to be detrimental and that there will be lives lost—how disgusting. We have actually pushed forward for apprenticeship schemes in this country, yet they're criticising it. They will not stand by it. They're supposed to be for the workers; they're not for the workers. They've never stood up for the workers in this country unless it fills their own back pockets with money from union fees. They push around an agenda to get their seats in this place, and then they forget about the people out there. They're not looking after the battlers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor's irresponsible plan to rapidly transition to a low-carbon-emitting Australia will end in tragedy. About 38 per cent of carbon emissions comes from the production of electricity, gas and water, so that sector cannot on its own deliver the 50 per cent savings promised by Labor. So I ask: where will savings in carbon emissions be made? There is a real danger that petrol and diesel prices will rise just as they have in France. Labor must rule out taxing carbon emissions on Australian passenger cars, trucks and other vehicles, including those used in agriculture and mining. The major emitters are in the Northern Hemisphere, not Australia, so go and clean up the rest of the world before you start having a go at us. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In Australia, rates of overweight and obesity have risen dramatically in recent decades in all age groups, with increases most marked among obese adults. We're facing a crisis. We may be the first generation that hands over a lower life expectancy to our kids than the one that we enjoyed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2014-15, two-thirds of Australian adults were overweight or obese and 71 per cent of men were overweight or obese, compared to 56 per cent of women. We know that is a problem because of the link between obesity and poor health outcomes. We know that that link is well established, that people who are overweight and obese have a heightened risk of developing a high range of chronic diseases. They include cardiovascular diseases, like heart disease, stroke and peripheral vascular diseases, but also type 2 diabetes. The distribution of fat around the body is important. Where it's visceral fat and stored around the body's vital organs, you have an increased risk of heart disease and other metabolic disorders. So we know that it is a serious health risk. We know that being overweight or obese increases your risk of at least 13 different types of cancer, including breast cancer and colon cancer. This is a major health issue. We have an epidemic of chronic disease looming over the horizon and we have an urgent need to address this issue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that this has changed over recent times. We know that people haven't suddenly started to make unhealthy choices. What we do know is that the environment around us has changed and that has led to the growing incidents of overweight and obesity. We heard from people like Belinda Smith from The Root Cause, who says that there is a frightening lack of understanding amongst many parents and children about the impacts of unhealthy foods on not just health but behaviour, concentration and academic results. We are now seeing a generation of kids who are going into adulthood with fatty liver disease, as well as some of the other diseases that I mentioned.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The inquiry had 150 submissions from a huge variety of key stakeholders. We had the major medical associations contribute to the report. I want to thank them. We had a number of other organisations involved in advocacy submit. We had industry representatives submit. We obviously had consumers and just groups of people who realise that this is an issue in schools and their local communities who made contributions through their submissions. We had four hearings between August and September. I want to thank all of the committee members for engaging in the report in a very constructive way. I see Senator Singh is here and so is Senator Storer, both of whom contributed to the report. We did, I think, in this committee engage in good faith and with a spirit of collaboration. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our report made 22 recommendations. This is a very comprehensive report. I particularly want to thank the secretariat for the huge work they put into drafting what is a very comprehensive report. It's a huge body of work. What we have come up with is, I think, a holistic range of recommendations. I am very proud of the work that the committee has done. What we have identified is that Australia does not have an overarching strategy to tackle obesity. The committee heard compelling evidence around the need—and this was almost universal—for a national strategy to tackle obesity. We also heard that there is not one single thing that we need to do but that we need a range of strategies to address the issue of obesity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also heard about the language used to describe this problem. 'Obesity' is a very stigmatising word, and one of the recommendations was to be aware of the stigma associated with the use of 'obesity'. It is a term that is used within the medical and scientific community without an obvious alternative, so we will continue to use that word, but in the context of clinical practice there may be other ways of being able to address this. So stigma and discrimination is certainly something that came up throughout the inquiry.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We heard that we have a problem with food labelling and that we need simple and consistent front-of-pack labelling to enable consumers to make healthier food choices. We heard about some of the limitations of the health star-rating system and some of the loopholes that exist. The committee's addressed a number of those issues and made recommendations about how we can improve the way the health star-rating system works. Of course, we heard that that needs to be mandatory—that, rather than having the industry decide which products they want to use it on, often as a marketing exercise, we need to have a comprehensive food-labelling system that is mandatory.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We heard about the impact of advertising of junk foods. This was something that came up time and time again. We heard that the junk food industry does often direct its advertising budget at young children. The report—I must say that that's the chair's report—recommends introducing restrictions on discretionary food and drink advertising on free-to-air TV up until 9 pm. I'll come to the additional and dissenting comments from some of the other senators. Certainly, the chair's report makes it very clear that we need to act when it comes to advertising restrictions, and we need to do that quickly. We learnt that we need to do more when it comes to public education; that, at the moment, there hasn't been investment in public education campaigns. We need more government leadership in this area.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the other things that was considered was a tax on sugar-sweetened beverages. This is something that has been recommended by all major health groups, including the World Health Organization. We learnt that many other jurisdictions have implemented them; 30 countries and a whole range of other subnational jurisdictions around the world are introducing sugar-sweetened beverages taxes. One of the things we learnt was that this has an impact not just in terms of driving consumption choices but, indeed, at the level of the manufacturers. When you introduce a tax like this, what we are seeing is some of the manufacturers respond by reducing the amount of sugar in their drinks so that they pay a lower tax on the beverages that are sold. This isn't something that just affects consumption; it also affects production. What we are seeing are healthier products being made available.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also learnt about the need for activity. We heard about programs like Walking School Bus, and so on. What we need to do is encourage physical activity wherever possible. We heard that the most successful programs were those community based multistrategy interventions—a whole-of-government approach. In different jurisdictions you have a range of these things being implemented together: restrictions on advertising; increasing physical activity; addressing things within schools; healthy lunch programs; getting rid of vending machines; and getting rid of fizzy drinks from cafeterias. There are a whole range of strategies directed at a community level to help drive down obesity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the things that I am encouraged by is, while there wasn't a consensus around the chair's report—it's true to say that the Liberal Party and the One Nation representatives didn't sign off on many of the more significant recommendations—I think there is an agreement that we do need a strategy. Issues around advertising, sugar-sweetened beverages taxes and mandatory food labelling were things that were rejected by the Liberal Party. The Labor Party did come to accept many of the recommendations. Unfortunately, Labor haven't gone as far as I'd like—indeed, when it comes to advertising, they haven't accepted the recommendation for restrictions on advertising up until 9 pm—but what they have at least done is accepted the need for a review. I am encouraged that, after the election of a Shorten Labor government, which I suspect is something that is a few months away, we will see a review into junk food advertising and, hopefully, we will see some action. Again, they haven't ruled out the sugar-sweetened beverage tax outright. They have indicated they are interested in watching the evidence as it unfolds. I hope we might see some movement from the Labor Party on that front.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In closing, we have got a comprehensive blueprint here through the establishment of a national strategy and, indeed, a national task force. One of the recommendations was, because of the different jurisdictions involved, we need to bring together a group of people, cross-jurisdictional experts, to establish a national task force to do all of these things that we know work: better labelling—and make it mandatory—to close the loopholes; restrictions on junk food advertising, particularly on free-to-air TV up until 9 pm so kids aren't being bombarded with this junk; sugar-sweetened beverages taxes; and more physical activity. Most importantly, we know it is not just one thing that's going to help us address it. We need community-led, multistrategy interventions if we are going to see the sort of change that we need to see to address what is an enormous problem here in Australia.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SINGH</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:29</span>):  Labor welcomes today's tabling of the report of the Senate Select Committee into the Obesity Epidemic in Australia. As the committee's deputy chair, I'd like to express my gratitude to all of those individuals and organisations from across Australia who made submissions to this inquiry—some 153 submissions—and also to those who appeared at public hearings.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the chair, Senator Di Natale, has outlined, obesity in Australia is a really serious problem. That is why I have 'enjoyed' this in the sense of being informed about what we can do at a policy level to tackle what has been termed an epidemic because the rates of obesity continue to rise. We have worked very constructively through this Senate select committee to come up with what I believe is a really constructive, full and informative report that has a number of key recommendations which I think will be of huge benefit to the Australian population going forward if they are implemented.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The rates of obesity are that 28 per cent of the population aged 15 and over are obese, making us the fifth highest among the OECD countries. And Australia's rate of childhood obesity is increasing rapidly. Our 2014-15 data showed that 63 per cent of Australian adults were overweight or obese, with 71 per cent of those men and 56 per cent women. There are currently over one million children in Australia who are overweight or obese, while 20 per cent of children aged two to four and 27 per cent of children and adolescents aged five to 17 are overweight or obese. I think those statistics are alarming because we know that the short-term health impacts for children and adolescents include chronic conditions such as breathing difficulties, fractures, hypertension, insulin resistance and early markers of cardiovascular disease. That's why government really needs to act to address this issue. The most significant long-term health impacts of childhood obesity that manifest into adulthood are cardiovascular disease, diabetes, musculoskeletal disorders and certain types of cancer.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We had a wide range of stakeholders make submissions to this committee's inquiry and they urged government to target health interventions and to hold broad education campaigns. And, as the chair has referred to, they raised the need for a national obesity task force, which is one of the key recommendations in this report. I think, indeed, many of us in this place were alarmed to learn that there was no body within government looking at addressing obesity. So as a start, I think that is something government could get on with and do straightaway.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some of the key submitters who we heard from during this inquiry's hearings included the Centre for Research Excellence in the Early Prevention of Obesity in Childhood; The Children's Hospital at Westmead in Sydney; Diabetes Australia; Choice; The Root Cause; the Global Obesity Centre; Parent's Voice; the Health Star Rating Advisory Committee; the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare; the Public Health Association of Australia; the National Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisation; the Australian Local Government Association; and, of course, the Department of Health. We listened to some passionate individuals, and one I want to highlight particularly is Belinda Smith, from a small organisation called The Root Cause. She shared with us about the foods that were in children's lunch boxes every day. I think that's a very good place to start.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Belinda and The Root Cause believe that with a focused effort at the grassroots level on school food—around what is in children's lunch boxes—it is possible to prevent and curb childhood obesity, plus improve on the sorts of academic results we have had thus far. She told me about an Australian tour that The Root Cause went on to transform children's health called the Real Food Lunchbox Project. Out of that project, she learnt that children just want to fit in. In saying that, children want to eat whatever their friends are eating. If their friends are eating packets, they eat packets. But if they are all eating real food—fruit and vegetables—then even the kids whose parents say they are fussy eaters will eat the fruit and vegetables.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Having listened to Belinda and hearing about her experience, which was in schools right across the country, where she saw pretty much the same thing happening, I think we can really learn from addressing this at the school level and at the educational campaign level and learn from looking at what jurisdictions overseas have done on that front. France and the UK are two easy examples. In France they actually have a cooked lunch within the school. I think the UK has a similar model to some degree.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When kids are turning up with sugary drinks, sugary foods, packaged foods or processed foods in their lunchbox it does not set them up well for the rest of their lives. I know it's quick and easy, but long-term it is doing them damage. We need to support families and schools to address this so that kids eat well, because not only is there a benefit to their physical health; there is a massive benefit to their mental health and to their learning capacity. That is something that we heard through evidence provided by organisations such as The Root Cause. There are so many individuals and organisations that are so passionate about this issue because they're at the coalface and are seeing what is going on with our kids.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The rise of obesity in our kids is really, really worrying. That's why we've proposed these recommendations, as Senator Di Natale went to: a national obesity strategy; looking at food labelling and how we can improve food labelling; looking at food reformulation; looking at advertising; looking at education campaigns; looking at healthcare interventions; at community based multistrategy interventions. This is a holistic issue. Yes, government can play a role, but it is also about the broader community, and we need to support the broader community in playing the role that it can play.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor is very pleased to support the majority of the report's recommendations, such as the establishment of a task force; an obesity strategy; and labelling that's fit for purpose, which obviously represents the nutritional value of foods and beverages. However, while we agree with the majority of the recommendations, we have provided a short dissenting report on the implementation of the sugar-sweetened beverage tax, and on restrictions and the mandatory health-star rating on food and drink advertising. But, as Senator Di Natale, the chair, said, this is something where Labor accepts the logic. We accept the logic that a sugar tax is likely to reduce consumption and accelerate the reformulation effort, but we need to recognise, as we heard throughout this inquiry, that that is only one option, amongst many, to address overweight and obesity. We need to recognise it simply would not be effective without those other measures. I think in other jurisdictions like the UK and Mexico the evidence around a sugar-sweetened beverage tax is still emerging, particularly in relation to obesity rates, but it is something that we still need to monitor closely, and we will do that. Similarly, with the changing nature of children's viewing of advertising—children don't just sit down in front of the TV anymore; they're using iPads, iPhones, computers, you name it—we need to look at other ways in which advertising is filtering through. That's why we've committed to having a review in relation to the advertising approach.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We take this incredibly seriously. Labor really want to see action to address obesity, particularly childhood obesity, in our country. We need to support the next generation so that they can be healthy young adults.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Acting President, it is my pleasure as a member of the Human Rights Sub-Committee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade to present the Committee's final report for the inquiry into human organ trafficking and organ transplant tourism.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The development of human organ transplantation surgery over the past half century has been a blessing for hundreds of thousands of otherwise terminally ill patients all over the world. Since the first kidney was successfully transplanted in 1954, organ transplantation techniques and anti-rejection medications have rapidly developed. The act of organ donation is a tremendous demonstration of the power of compassion to transform the lives of many people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Australia has a lot to be proud of in the field of organ transplantation. We are a world leader in successful transplant outcomes, and since the implementation of the Organ and Tissue Donation Reform program in 2008, our donation rate has more than doubled.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Australian researchers, doctors and surgeons have led the world in terms of liver transplantation techniques in particular. Australian surgeons have pioneered paediatric liver transplants, segmented liver transplants and, notably, in 2006 at the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital in Sydney, a world first kidney-liver-pancreas transplant was successfully undertaken.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In 2017, 1,675 Australian lives were transformed by 510 deceased and 273 living organ donors. There were 832 kidney transplants, 281 liver transplants, 206 lung transplants, 98 heart transplants, 51 pancreas transplants, and 1 small intestine transplant. Each of these transplants represents multiple changed lives — not only of recipients and donors, whether deceased or living; but their families, friends, neighbours and colleagues. Organ donation and transplantation touches entire communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Unfortunately for those Australians waiting for a new organ, demand for donor organs still outstrips supply. Around 1,400 Australians are currently waitlisted for a transplant. A further 11,000 are on dialysis, many of whom would benefit from a kidney transplant. It can take years for a suitable organ to become available, the average waiting time for a kidney transplant is 3 years. Approximately one person each week will die before they are able to receive an organ transplant.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This shortfall is common to many countries around the globe, even those with a donor program. But there are still countries who have no organ donation and transplant program whatsoever. It is this gap between the number of people requiring organ transplants and the limited supply of freely donated organs, which has generated a black-market trade in human organs throughout the world. With increased access to international markets thanks to cheap air travel, and the ease in which potential donors may now be located thanks to improvements in internet connections, organ trafficking has increasingly become a major problem for the international community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In this illicit commercial market of organ trafficking and so called transplant tourism, desperate people, often facing certain death without a transplant, may travel far from their own countries to places such as Egypt, the Philippines, or Pakistan, paying tens of thousands of dollars and more, for an organ transplant where the donor is most likely in dire financial straits, possibly exploited and unable to give free and informed consent to donation. The recipient faces much higher risks of infection and insufficient post-operative care than they would receive here in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Organ trafficking, the unethical removal, transfer or commercialisation of human organs for transplantation outside legal frameworks poses severe risks for both organ recipients and donors. It is an illicit trade that changes over time with developments in transplantation surgery techniques, the availability of medical infrastructure, uneven economic development, migration patterns, demographic trends, socio-economic exclusion, and the evolution of national and multinational criminal networks.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This inquiry by the Human Rights Sub-Committee of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade was prompted, in the first instance, by longstanding allegations by non-government organisations and individuals about alleged human organ harvesting and trafficking occurring in one specific country, but, it quickly became clear, especially through input from expert witnesses, that human organ trafficking is a broad international problem encompassing many countries around the world. The organ trade has evolved and continues to evolve under the influence of forces of demand and supply, technical and medical advances, as well as changes in national and international regulation and law enforcement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Sub-Committee has heard from medical practitioners, international bodies, government agencies, and human rights advocates. Their evidence was consistent: organ trafficking is a violation of the rights and dignity of people, and Australia must do more to stop people in our community travelling overseas to support it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">What has also come to light, is that judgements made about the extent and geographical focus of organ trafficking and transplant tourism a decade or more ago may have limited validity in relation to present trends and circumstances, and this report demonstrates that without the collection of accurate data and adequate analysis, solutions will be difficult to create.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The evidence indicates that past practices in China involved the use of organs taken from executed prisoners. Evidence from some submitters reveals that this practice has changed—this needs to be vindicated and monitored.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This report examines the global prevalence of human organ trafficking and the scope of Australian participation within this illicit trade. The report further considers international frameworks to combat organ trafficking and organ transplant tourism and specifically recommends that Australia sign and ratify the <span style="font-style:italic;">Council of Europe Convention against Trafficking in Human Organs</span>.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The report further recommends that the Australian Government pursue a range of measures to strengthen Australia's involvement in international efforts to combat human organ trafficking, improve relevant data collection, support public health education programs, strengthen Australia's legal prohibitions on organ trafficking, and thoroughly investigate reforms that would enhance Australia's domestic organ donation program.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It should be noted that surveys show the majority of Australians ‑ approximately 70 per cent – are willing to donate their organs and/or tissue when they die. In Australia, 90 per cent of families say yes to donation when their loved one is a registered donor.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Despite this apparent support for organ donation, and a majority of Australians believing that registering is important, only one in three Australians are registered as donors. While 71 per cent of Australians think it is important to talk about organ donation with their family, only half – 51 per cent – of Australians have held this discussion about whether they want to be a donor with their loved ones.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This report largely deals with measures that are aimed at suppressing human organ trafficking and transplant tourism. However, a comprehensive solution to this grim trade must involve increasing Australia's rate of organ donation and harnessing the goodwill and overwhelming support of the community to ensure Australians can receive a life changing organ transplant at home, without ever needing to consider entering the murky world of black market organ transplantation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Compassion, not commerce is the key.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">Of the new bills examined in chapter 1 of this report, 6 have been assessed as not raising human rights concerns as they promote, permissibly limit, or do not engage, human rights. The committee has also requested further information in relation to two instruments. Chapter 2 of the report contains the committee's concluded examination of a number of pieces of legislation.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The committee's scrutiny reports inform the deliberations of parliament by providing a technical examination of the compatibility of legislation with Australia's obligations under international human rights law. As I have noted on previous occasions, committee members performing this technical scrutiny function are not bound by the contents or conclusions of scrutiny committee reports and may have different views in relation to the policy merits of legislation.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The reports also play an important function by engaging in dialogue with legislation proponents about questions of human rights compatibility. To that end, the statements of compatibility accompanying legislation and the minister's responses to the committee's inquiries are essential for the committee in undertaking its scrutiny function. While many legislation proponents engage diligently in the scrutiny-dialogue process, as outlined in the committee's reports, there is scope for improvement in some cases. In the committee's consideration of recent legislation, there have been some cases where lack of sufficient information from the legislation proponent has meant that the committee is unable to conclude that particular measures are compatible with human rights. I encourage legislation proponents to consider the committee's previous reports when preparing statements of compatibility and responses to the committee's inquiries. </span>

I would like to take this opportunity to thank my fellow committee members for their engagement throughout the year. A number of the bills scheduled for debate this week have been considered by this committee in the current report or in our recent reports, including in relation to:</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator WHISH-WILSON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:49</span>):  I rise tonight to address the Treasury Laws Amendment (Enhancing Whistleblower Protections) Bill 2017. Like Senator O'Neill, I will be referring to the Senate Economics Legislation Committee report on the Treasury Laws Amendment (Enhancing Whistleblower Protections) Bill 2017 and the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services whistleblower protection inquiry, which of course looked at a comprehensive suite of legislative measures to make sure that we have an effective set of laws to protect whistleblowers in this country. Effective whistleblowing provides an essential service in fostering integrity and accountability, while deterring and exposing misconduct, fraud and corruption. A recent analysis of whistleblower protections across G20 countries found Australia's laws to be comprehensive for the public sector, but lacking in the private sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The inquiry produced in an excellent report. I saw a lot of the work that went into that by a number of people—especially you, Senator O'Neill, in the chamber today—and I'd like to recognise that, because this is a critical area. If we are going to address fraud and misconduct in the financial services sector—and, in fact, in other sectors and in any workplace—these laws need to be hard and fast and we need to get them right. Evidence presented to the inquiry, as well as consideration of existing laws, indicates that whistleblower protections remain largely theoretical in this country with little practical effect in either the public or private sectors. This is due, in large part, to the near-impossibility of achieving under current laws four key things: protecting whistleblowers from reprisals and retaliatory action; holding those responsible for reprisals to account; effective investigation of alleged reprisals; and whistleblowers being able to seek redress for reprisals. Another significant issue identified by the committee was the fragmented nature of whistleblower legislation. In particular, significant inconsistencies exist not only between various pieces of Commonwealth, public and private sector whistleblower legislation but also across the various pieces of legislation that apply to different parts of the private sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee has made a number of recommendations. Sadly, not all those recommendations in the report are in this legislation that we have before us tonight. The legislation was probably written and drafted over a period of time before the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services released its very extensive and good work. That's a very important point. Personally, I would have preferred to have seen the legislation brought forward at a point in time where we could have comprehensively addressed the many issues that were outlined in the report. The committee, through this report into whistleblower protections, recommended separate public and private whistleblower protection legislation. However, it recognised that it would be the preference, certainly of Labor and the Greens, to have a single act in the first place. Nevertheless, this is a first step. The work of the committee was assisted by a substantial body of evidence over the past two decades on whistleblower protections. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Acting Deputy President Williams, I know you would join with me at this point in recognising three whistleblowers that I have had the pleasure of speaking to and working with over recent years, going back to 2014 and the original ASIC inquiry, which you were instrumental in getting up and running. One of those is Don Morris from CBA, who came forward during the inquiry as a whistleblower, concerned that the information he'd given to ASIC hadn't been properly followed up.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator WHISH-WILSON:</span>
                    </a>  Yes, sorry—Jeff Morris. Don Morris is actually a Tasmanian, so apologies to Jeff. The information he brought forward led to a separate line of inquiry into CBA and, of course, a call by the committee for a royal commission into CBA back then, which in many ways set in motion a number of Senate inquiries following that, which led us on this long and winding road to the banking royal commission that we have now. I also acknowledge Dr Benjamin Koh from CommInsure who came forward and spoke to <span style="font-style:italic;">Four Corners</span>. I had a number of discussions with Dr Koh. He is a very brave man, who, once again, took on the might of the Commonwealth Bank and found himself out on his backside under incredible stress and pressure simply for being honest and wanting to do the right thing. And, of course, the other whistleblower who came forward in the ASIC inquiry was Mr James Wheeldon, who blew the whistle on practices at ASIC which essentially reflected on the corporate regulator being too close to its clients, the major banks. While that was controversial at the time, I think we've seen through the banking royal commission and other disclosures that that cosy culture between the regulator and the banks has been a serious problem and needs to be addressed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Had these whistleblowers not come forward, it would have been a lot harder for us to do our work. That disclosure is essential and it is in the public interest. But what I do know from not just their experiences but a number of other whistleblower experiences is that, if you blow the whistle, particularly in a big corporation or a big organisation, be it a government department, be it a large company or be it a smaller organisation, you're branded for life. You're branded for life if you are a whistleblower, regardless of whether or not you're doing the right thing. Your motivations may be pure. You want to see injustice or an aggrievement addressed, but you are branded for life. No matter what kind of platitudes I've heard, I believe that whistleblowers find it very difficult to be re-employed, and many of them end up suffering mental illness and issues because they've taken a brave stance and they've taken on the powers that be. Of course, that's why the Greens have had a very strong view that we should actually have a US system of financial rewards in place for whistleblowers. I think what you're giving up, essentially, is a lifetime of employment. You're going to find it very difficult to be employed once you're branded as a whistleblower. Although you've done the right thing, for some reason, the aspersion is cast that somehow or another you are not trustworthy because you have blown the whistle on improper practices in an organisation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So one of the committee's main recommendations is the establishment of a whistleblower protection authority, to be housed within a single body or an existing body, that can support whistleblowers, assess and prioritise the treatment of whistleblowing allegations, conduct investigations of reprisals and provide oversight on the implementation of the whistleblowing regime for both the public and private sectors.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Greens believe this Bill is a missed opportunity.

                  <span class="HPS-Small">As is noted in the committee report, the Bill fails to address a number of recommendations from the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services' report on Whistleblower Protections. The report provides a contemporary and comprehensive list of reforms required to protect and compensate whistleblowers. These recommendations were unanimously agreed to by members of both houses, from multiple parties, only six months ago.

She was made redundant after she blew the whistle on corporate malfeasance at Origin Energy in 2015. After she did that, but before she was made redundant, she found herself undermined, derided, marginalised and threatened with termination, before finally being made redundant. She emerged as one of the lucky ones. Her life was relatively intact, she was a highly experienced lawyer and she had a very close and supportive family. So Ms McDow was able to withstand the immense pressure and she was also able to find herself a new sense of purpose. She, in fact, launched the first ever court case that tested the strength of Australia's corporate whistleblower scheme in 2016, and she created her own law firm, CPR Partners, a firm that supports fellow whistleblowers and also trains corporations on their obligations. She says that the people who she has helped have had their lives all but destroyed for speaking out. In her words, 'No-one wants to be a whistleblower because it is just a fate worse than—well, you wouldn't wish it on your worst enemy.'</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia's current private sector whistleblower laws are fragmented and confusing. Civil remedies are limited. Claimants are exposed to legal cost risks and have great difficulty in discharging their evidential burden in proceedings for compensation in relation to reprisals. Offences committed against whistleblowers have rarely been prosecuted. Companies have been practically prohibited from undertaking investigations, as they could not share information related to the disclosure, regardless of whether it identified whistleblower or it didn't. Anonymous disclosures were simply not allowed, and neither were emergency disclosures to the media or emergency disclosures to parliamentarians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So the bill before us today, the Treasury Laws Amendment (Enhancing Whistleblower Protections) Bill 2017, remedies these deficiencies. The current bill will introduces new protections in two separate acts. The Corporations Act 2001 will be amended to create a single, strengthened whistleblower protection regime that covers the corporate, financial and credit sectors. The Taxation Administration Act 1953 will be amended to add new protections to tax whistleblowers who report tax misconduct.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Part 1 of this bill will strengthen protection for corporate whistleblowers by expanding protections to a broader class of persons and expanding disclosures that can be protected. It will also extend protections to cover third-party disclosures in certain circumstances. It will provide greater protection of whistleblower confidentiality. It will improve access to compensation for whistleblowers and create a new penalty offence so that law enforcement agencies will be better able to take enforcement action. In introducing a whistleblower policy requirement for all large companies, this bill amalgamates the protections that are contained in several acts into the Corporations Act 2001. The consolidation will cover the following: the ASIC Act, the Banking Act 1959, the Insurance Act 1973, the Life Insurance Act 1995 and the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993. It will also add protections for the conduct that contravenes the National Consumer Credit Protection Act 2009 and the Financial Sector (Collection of Data) Act 2001, which were not previously covered under the existing law.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Part 2 of this bill will introduce new protections for tax whistleblowers, specifically, in the Taxation Administration Act 1953. These are broadly consistent with the enhanced protections under the Corporations Act and will facilitate disclosures about tax misconduct.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The improved whistleblower protections strike the right balance between encouraging genuine whistleblowers to come forward and removing protections for vexatious complaints. The reforms will facilitate a workable scheme for the industry whilst also providing appropriate protection and access to redress for whistleblowers who choose to come forward despite the personal sacrifice that is often involved. Very broadly, the new whistleblower protections align with the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services report into whistleblower protections in the corporate, public and not-for-profit sectors. The remaining recommendations not covered by the new legislation are still under consideration by the government and will be addressed in due course in the government's response to that report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services. The measures in this bill are to commence from 1 July 2018 in accordance with the government's commitments. The whistleblower policy requirement mandated for all public and large priority companies, including registerable superannuation entities, will be effective six months later, from 1 January 2019.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What do whistleblower protections in this legislation actually do?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will strengthen the corporate sector whistleblower protections and introduce new protections for tax whistleblowers. The Corporations Act 2001 is amended, as I said, to create a single strengthened whistleblower protection regime that covers the corporate, financial and credit sectors. The new whistleblower protection regime to be created in the Taxation Administration Act of 1953 will protect those who report breaches or suspected breaches of tax law and also misconduct in relation to an entity's tax affairs. So, very broadly, the corporate tax whistleblower regime will protect the identity of whistleblowers, protect them from reprisals, provide access to remedies and provide eligible recipients of whistleblower disclosures with the ability to take action or investigate the alleged misconduct.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The new whistleblower protections in the taxation law are broadly consistent with the protections under the Corporations Act, but the key difference between the corporations and tax whistleblower regimes is that all types of entities—including individuals, bodies of persons, partnerships and all trusts—are covered by the tax regime. Eligible recipients under the tax regime differ from those under the corporate regime due to the nature of the information that is being disclosed. So, for example, tax and BAS agents of entities are eligible recipients under the tax regime. The tax regime also does not contain equivalent provisions to the corporate regime relating to emergency and public interest disclosures. Also, the tax regime does not explicitly exclude personal work related grievances from protection because the scope of the tax whistleblower regime is already limited to disclosures about tax affairs only.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So how will these new changes, these new whistleblower protections, help whistleblowers and also help companies? Corporate crime is estimated to cost Australia more than $8.5 billion every year and it accounts for approximately 40 per cent of the total cost of crime in Australia. Whistleblowing clearly plays a critical role in uncovering corporate and tax misconduct. Through this legislation, whistleblowers will benefit not only from increased protections and improved access to civil remedies but also from greater certainty about their legal position and their ability to prove claims. So there's no risk of an adverse cost order against them, unless a claim is found to be vexatious. The secondary beneficiaries of these new laws will be Australian businesses themselves as corporate governance and integrity practices will increase with officers, employees and taxpayers aware that there is now a much higher likelihood that misconduct will be reported.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important to understand why these whistleblower protections are being introduced now. Whistleblower legislative protections have formed part of the Corporations Act for a considerable period of time—in fact, since 2004—but the protections that have existed since that time have been used very sparingly and, increasingly, they have been perceived as inadequate, given recent advances in whistleblower protections in the public sector and also in overseas jurisdictions. So, to specifically address these issues, the government committed in December 2016, two years ago, as part of the open government national action plan to ensure that appropriate protections are in place for people who report corruption, who report fraud, who report tax evasion or tax avoidance and also who report misconduct within the corporate sector. The commitment in that open government national action plan also reaffirmed the government's 2016-17 budget announcement that it would introduce new arrangements to better protect individuals who disclose information to the ATO on tax avoidance behaviour and also any other tax issues.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The whistleblower protections that are in this legislation incorporate the recommendations of the whistleblower protections report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Corporations and Financial Services. The parliamentary inquiry into whistleblower protections delivered its report on 13 September 2017. It concluded that existing whistleblower protections are ineffective in both the public and the private sector. That committee, in its report, made 35 recommendations to strengthen the regime. The Treasury Laws Amendment (Enhancing Whistleblower Protections) Bill 2017 that we are considering today covers many of the current parliamentary inquiry recommendations. The government, as I said, is considering the remaining recommendations and will respond to all of the recommendations in that parliamentary joint committee report in due course.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's understandable to question why the government isn't introducing a single private sector whistleblower regime with a whistleblower protection authority. Indeed, this was something that was examined by the parliamentary joint committee. In the 2016-17 budget, the government announced that it would introduce new arrangements to better protect individuals who disclose information to the ATO on tax avoidance behaviour and also on other tax issues. In December 2016, the government also committed to pursuing reforms to whistleblower protections in the corporate sector under the Open Government National Action Plan and reaffirmed its tax whistleblower 2016-17 budget announcement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The parliamentary inquiry into whistleblower protections report, which was handed down, as I said, in September 2017, recommended a single private sector whistleblower regime, and it also recommended a whistleblower protection authority. The government has given very careful consideration to each recommendation and addresses many of these recommendations in this bill, as I said. But the bill includes an explicit requirement for a post-implementation review of the amended whistleblower laws five years after the amendments commence, which allows the government an opportunity to assess the effectiveness of the legislation and to determine whether any further reforms should be made in the future. The government will respond to those recommendations, as I said, in due course.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's also understandable to question why the government isn't introducing a rewards system for whistleblowers. I did hear Senator Whish-Wilson mention that before in his contribution. In the 2016-17 budget, the government announced that it would introduce these new arrangements to better protect individuals who disclose information to the ATO on tax avoidance behaviour and on other tax issues, and it committed to pursuing reforms to whistleblower protections. While the parliamentary inquiry did recommend the introduction of a rewards system, the government has carefully considered all of the recommendations, including this one. This bill includes an explicit requirement for a post-implementation review, as I have said. It does not, however, include a reward system for whistleblowers. The government would like an opportunity to assess the effectiveness of the legislation and to determine whether any further reforms should be made in the future. It will respond to the recommendations of that PJC report in due course, and will consider introducing a rewards system after that post-implementation review period.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There has been some concern as to whether introducing these whistleblower protections would impose undue regulatory burden on companies. The corporate whistleblower reforms will not result in any direct cost to companies, as they actually relate to strengthening the existing laws and addressing the legislative gaps in protection. The requirement for public companies, large proprietary companies and registerable superannuation entities to have a whistleblower policy is not expected to have any material or lasting financial impact. The policy must include information about the protections available to whistleblowers, to whom disclosures can be made, how the company will investigate the disclosure and support the whistleblower, and how the company will ensure fair treatment of employees who are mentioned in whistleblower disclosures. The costs imposed for many companies will include one-off implementation costs and also costs for annual training. Direct benefits will be derived for companies that are adopting these changes or adapting their existing whistleblower policies, including promoting internal reporting and investigations in the first instance, which will facilitate much higher quality self-regulation and corporate governance practices, and, of course, will also improve their compliance with the law. The new tax whistleblower regime does not impose any regulatory burden on companies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To ensure that businesses have sufficient time to understand their legal obligations arising from this legislation, a government amendment to the bill has been made to provide for the whistleblower policy requirement to apply six months after the commencement date of the amendments, instead of 1 January 2019.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:19</span>):  Paris, the 'City of Light', is ablaze. Ablaze not with shimmering Christmas lights strung along the ribs of the Eiffel Tower. No, Paris is ablaze not figuratively but literally. As we speak, the Champs Elysees is littered with the carcasses of burnt-out police cars. The Arc de Triomphe stands defaced with grafftied profanity, and the shelves of businesses stand charred and abandoned. Over 100 people have been hospitalised, and police have been engaged in running street battles. The French watch in horror as their neighbourhoods are engulfed in raging violence. This violence is an entirely homegrown phenomenon, protesting against President Macron's decision to increase the levy on diesel fuel by over 14 per cent. And what is the rationale for this radical raising of revenue? France's Prime Minister has described these measures as a 'taxe carbone', a carbon tax designed to ward off—you've guessed it—climate change. In other words, this arbitrary increase in fuel prices was just another exercise in Chicken Little environmentalism. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the tres chic circles of inner Paris, this policy was very well received. But, outside of Paris's bubble, it is a very different story. In smaller towns and rural regions of France, car or truck ownership is not a luxury but a necessity. These non-Parisians can't commute to work via the metro. They are like many of my constituents in Tasmania—they have to drive many kilometres each day. Those massive increases in the cost of fuel, courtesy of a carbon tax arbitrarily imposed for the sake of this dogma, have smashed the economy of regional France, and the people are fighting back. We are talking about real pain inflicted on real people in real life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thankfully, in Australia, we resolved these issues without the unacceptable antisocial behaviour displayed by our French cousins. In Australia, we rejected the carbon tax, and resoundingly so, at the ballot box in 2013. Why? Because it was hurting real people. Sure, the Canberra bubble and elites condemned the Liberals; indeed, we were told we were so out of tune with the desires of the Australian people that we would be resoundingly defeated at the ballot box. But the Australian people embraced the Liberal promise, and we abolished this household budget-busting, jobs-destroying tax with a people's mandate so generously given in that landslide election victory.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Make no mistake, sound environmental policy is supported by our fellow Australians and, indeed, by the Liberals. What the Australian people, like the French, won't support is counterproductive cost-of-living-sapping virtue-signalling policy from the self-appointed elites. The billions of dollars of taxpayers' money spent in bad policy on producing more expensive energy has seen pensioners, small businesses, household budgets, farmers and manufacturers all severely prejudiced. In this debate, they are the forgotten people, not like the ones that fly to the international gab-fests in their private jets and then complain about the carbon footprint of countries like Australia that seek to provide energy at a reasonable price to their pensioners, their small businesses, their farmers and their manufacturers. Indeed, we've seen jobs and wealth exported from Australia to other countries where they then burn our coal and emit CO2 in even greater quantities than we would—thus, if we believe the proponents, hurting the world's environment even more. Talk about lose-lose! Despite these glaring objective facts— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:25</span>):  In the five years of this government we have seen its failure to deal with the aged-care reform that was handed to them by Labor. We did the heavy lifting when we were in government, with the Living Longer Living Better reforms, but the government has been unable to properly roll out or implement that strategy. In fact, when those opposite called the royal commission into aged care it was a blatant admission of their failures on aged care. They've neglected and mismanaged the portfolio and have slashed money from it. As a result, older Australians and their families are suffering. They're really being hurt.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last Friday, the government released the latest data on the home care package waiting list. Lo and behold, the numbers have blown out again. There's a surprise! There are now more than 126,000 vulnerable Australians waiting for home care. This is a disgrace. Since the first release of the data last year, the waiting list for home care has grown from 88,000 older Australians to more than 126,000. The Minister for Senior Australians and Aged Care, Ken Wyatt, has already admitted that the government needs to consider other interventions to reduce the waiting list, but clearly it isn't doing enough. The government has form when it comes to dishonesty about the waiting list. It has cherrypicked figures to paint a rosy picture, and with this latest round of data has masked the full extent of the crisis by removing the total waiting-list numbers. Can anyone tell us why it has omitted this? Can anyone trust this incompetent and out-of-touch government to fix the crisis in aged care when it won't even be honest with older Australians?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">More than 100,000 older Australians will spend Christmas waiting for care that they've been approved for. People waiting for level 3 and 4 packages still have to wait 12 months or more. The waiting time for those needing a level 2 package is 12 months, and it's a three- to six-month wait for a level 1 package. What are the government doing about this? What are they waiting for? That's the question. What are they really waiting for? How many older Australians do they need to join the waiting list before they take adequate action? Are they going to sit and wait for two years for the recommendations of the royal commission before they do anything? Is that what's going to happen? Quite frankly, that is not an option. People are really hurting.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the list grows longer and longer, fresh stories emerge daily of older Australians waiting for care. My office and my colleagues in the House of Representatives and the Senate are receiving calls every week from people who are at their wits end. I have heard some absolute horror stories. For example, an elderly constituent in his 90s, from a working-class area, where you work hard all of your life to make ends meet, contacted my colleague's office after trying to access a package for his wife. She was placed on the waiting list for a level 4 package back in 2014. Fast-forward to January 2017: the constituent's wife passed away without a package. This is a disgrace. It's not acceptable and shouldn't be happening in our nation. How much assistance do people get? Zilch from this government; they get zero—absolutely nothing. An 86-year-old woman on a level 2 package since the start of 2017 has dementia and is unable to care for herself. Her health care is steadily increasing. She lives with her son, who has serious caregiver stress as he struggles to manage her care, his job, caring for his own family and the battle to get home care for his mother. Then there are the heartbreaking side-effects of dementia. The family is coping with her inability to speak properly, her loss of language and her confusion. This has a huge physical, emotional and financial impact on the whole family. Their lives have been turned upside down. These are the stories we hear day in, day out. This government is so neglectful. It has been so dishonest. The Prime Minister said, when he took the reins after stabbing Mr Turnbull in the back, that he was going to make older Australians and aged care a priority. This is what this government calls a priority—126,000 vulnerable Australians waiting for home care? I'd like to see somebody who does take this seriously. I'm calling on the government to take action. That action is needed now. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:30</span>):  In May this year, Professor Peter Ridd was sacked by James Cook University. His crime? To calmly and consistently call for the implementation of a quality assurance process to verify and safeguard the integrity of scientific research. It started in 2016 when Professor Ridd was threatened with the sack but was, instead, censured for drawing attention to misleading photos used to support claims of severe damage to inshore reefs. These photos were in a 2014 report by the Centre of Excellence for Coral Reef Studies and the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This report was so flawed that it prompted the former chairman of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority, Ian McPhail, to observe that when it came to the reef it seemed there was a group of researchers who began with the premise that all was a disaster. The following year, Professor Ridd contributed a chapter to the book <span style="font-style:italic;">Climate Change: The Facts 2017</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span>where he stated that thermal bleaching from climate change was unlikely to be a primary threat to the Great Barrier Reef. A new disciplinary hearing was called, where Professor Ridd was ordered by the university to not speak publicly on the issue and to keep secret the disciplinary action being taken against him. Subsequent private conversations with other academic staff and his wife about the issue were regarded by JCU as evidence of misconduct. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the university's disciplinary proceedings continued through 2017, Professor Ridd was due to undertake previously arranged public lectures on his work. JCU took the extraordinary step of insisting that the 30-year veteran of reef science and coastal oceanography have his presentations vetted. They told him to remove particular PowerPoint slides and instructed him about what could be said. This attempt to stifle Professor Ridd's statements on a subject in which he is an expert amounts to petty-minded and egregious interference in intellectual discussion and scientific inquiry. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Professor Ridd says that he has now been severely compromised as a well-respected academic being able to draw attention to quality assurance deficiencies in science. In August 2017, James Cook University informed Professor Ridd that he had committed serious academic misconduct by drawing attention publicly to the consequences of unverified scientific research. Professor Ridd concluded that the issue was descending into Star Chamber proceedings. So he made known the university's disciplinary action against him. He then started proceedings in the Federal Court against JCU. In May 2018 the tenured professor was fired. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Professor Ridd has studied the Great Barrier Reef for over 30 years and is of the firm view that threats to the reef from climate change and pollution, while present, are vastly exaggerated. He wants to see an independent agency checking the science before researchers spend hundreds of millions of dollars of taxpayers' funds. At what point did it become misconduct to call for discussion on quality assurance in scientific research? Who gets to determine which science is to be questioned and which will not—grant-seeking administrators or scientists? </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What has the university done about the serious point raised by Ridd—that is, the poor quality assurance of publicly funded scientific research? Nothing. They are proceeding on the basis that if they make an example of Ridd no other academic will dare challenge the university groupthink or support the need for quality assurance of scientific research. These proceedings were initiated by Vice-Chancellor Sandra Harding, shrouded in secrecy, full of intimidation and an embarrassment to fair-minded inquiring minds. She should be sacked and, until she is, taxpayer funding of JCU should cease. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Australian Greens Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:34</span>):  I rise tonight to talk about a very important project in Western Australia, and the threats that it faces. In Western Australia there is a project running called 50 Lives 50 Homes. It's under threat at the moment because part of its funding support is uncertain. Part of the project that supports this is its after-hours support service. It's an integral part of this project. That particular part of this project is funded through the after-hours healthcare funding stream provided by, and funded through, the primary health networks. The problem here is the uncertainty about what future funding will be available for that particular funding stream.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What I'd like to do is explain some of the absolutely critical work that 50 Lives 50 Homes does. I will say at the outset that I have spent time with the after-hours support service, and I've travelled with them. They support homeless people and also support people in the homes that they have found for them. So 50 Lives 50 Homes triages the most vulnerable homeless people, with typical clients having co-existing mental health, substance use and chronic health issues, including a significant proportion with three or more chronic illnesses. To date the project has housed 164 people in 134 houses. There's a collaborative approach with this project, and it has enabled multiple services to come together to achieve an 84 per cent retention rate for clients housed for over a year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The outcomes of this project are being monitored by an independent evaluation by the University of Western Australia Centre for Social Impact. Through this, they are accessing linked data from hospitals, police and the project. It has been demonstrated that there is a 39 per cent reduction in ED presentations in a group housed for the past six months, and a 57 per cent reduction for those housed for 12 months or more. There is a 46 per cent reduction in hospital admissions for those housed for six months, and a 51 per cent reduction in admissions for those housed for 12 months. This translates into significant savings per person: $5,279 per person over six months and a whopping $9,181 per person over 12 months in hospital costs. You can see that that is a very significant saving. Most importantly, it's keeping these people in homes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Part of this process, as I said, is the very important after-hours support service, which provides very essential services to those that are currently homeless. As I said, I have been with and travelled with the team that works with this group. I've also met people who are being supported in the housing that has been found for them, and they attest to the excellent service that has been provided.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also have to say here that Ruah Community Services are helping with delivering these services. They have written to Western Australian senators, asking us to find out what is going on with this funding stream. I've got some questions for the government. They are seeking from the federal government information around the future funding issues, and they really want to know what is happening with the after-hours primary healthcare funding stream. They want to know if the federal government is intending to continue the funding stream for PHNs, and if this is likely to be the same level or an adjusted level for the current funding. They want to know what the time frame is for the federal government to inform the PHNs about the future of this funding stream. They want to know, if the funding stream is reduced or discontinued, what contingency funding or other arrangements will be put in place to ensure that critical programs such as 50 Lives 50 Homes are given sufficient resourcing to enable this process to continue and time to transition if they need to find alternative arrangements. They also want to know: if the funding stream is reduced or discontinued, will the federal government redirect funding into an alternative funding stream for PHNs? If so, what will the focus of this be? This is an extremely important program achieving essential outcomes. We beg the government to clear this up.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CAROL BROWN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:40</span>):  I rise to address the chamber on the matter of COP24, or the Conference of the Parties, taking place in Poland this week. The COP is an annual conference, but, as we draw towards 2030, when we would cross over a number of critical tipping points, the conference is also an annual reminder of how little time we have to act. That is a very real possibility, unless we take serious action, and we're running out of time to take serious action. We're running out of time to take the kind of action that will ensure the long-term wellbeing of our children and our children's children. We're running out of time at precisely the same time as those opposite debate what size stick they'll take to the energy companies. It's a matter of complete insanity, quite frankly, that, as we stare down one of the most serious threats to our survival as a species, we're unable to convince those opposite that serious action needs to be taken, and needs to be taken immediately. We're a rich nation, and we can, and we must, do more.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the Fijian President noted in statements overnight, we need to do roughly five times more than we're currently doing to cut emissions. That's why, without action on climate change, Prime Minister Morrison's Pacific pivot is meaningless. It's why comments by the L-plater environment minister about people from the Pacific being all about money are most unwelcome, and it's why we need to do more on climate change, if we're serious about such a pivot. That's why when we rank 21 out of 25 nations in a new league table on clean energy development at the COP, it's more than simply embarrassing. We are 21 out of 25. In a country with abundant sun and wind, we lag near the back of the pack on critical climate action while our neighbours, New Zealand, are at the head of the pack at No. 3.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What is holding us back? What is it that's preventing us from taking the action necessary to lead on clean technologies and emissions reduction? It's this government. While this government loves to talk about themselves and loves to be out there leaking against one another, it doesn't like to talk about what we're leaving those who come after us in the form of climate change. It doesn't like to talk about how we could be taking the action necessary to make sure our children and their children grow up in a cleaner Australia—in an Australia with a thriving renewable energy industry. Instead, all we've seen from this government is climate wars.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The purpose of the negotiations in Poland is to go beyond this and to take the tangible steps necessary to reach the aims set out in the Paris Agreement three years ago. Negotiators are working to achieve the Paris rulebook—the issues that set out how we achieve the goals of Paris. That's why, overnight, 45 countries signed the Solidarity and Just Transition Silesia Declaration, which acknowledges the seriousness of the threat we face currently and the need to take action to build the workforce of tomorrow—a workforce equipped to transition to a low greenhouse gas economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While the signatories to the Just Transition Declaration included Japan, the UK, Canada and New Zealand, the Morrison government refused to sign. The Morrison government refused to sign a declaration that sets out a vision for Australian workers and for the workforce of the future. The government refused to sign something that has intergenerational quality at its core and puts forward a clear vision for the future. Unfortunately, this government has no vision for the future. While at COP24, Greta Thunberg spoke on a panel about her need to strike from school to demand more action on climate change, government ministers in Australia have spoken critically of the actions of children like Greta. They've been criticising young Australians for taking action on climate change when they won't, precisely as the rest of the world is looking at young people and learning from them. As Greta Thunberg said yesterday:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Nothing is happening so I guess I need to do something.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Nothing sums up the state of affairs with the Australian government better than that. We have a government that refuses to take any action on climate change altogether. The government can't hide behind coal any longer. It can't use the excuse that Australia is unique in its abundance of coal. In fact, the COP meeting this year is held in an old coalmining town in Poland. Yet, the Polish leader— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>
