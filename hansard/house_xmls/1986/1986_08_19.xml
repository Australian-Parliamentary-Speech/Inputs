I ask the honourable gentleman: Why was the Government's detailed submission to the 1986 national wage case virtually silent on the terms of trade crisis? Why did the Treasurer's major address to the Economic Planning Advisory Council in May express no concern about our terms of trade? Why did the Treasurer say only three months ago that the Australian economy was entirely robust and entirely healthy despite the then record high interest rates, very high inflation and major balance of payments troubles? Is the Prime Minister willing to offer the Australian public some apology and explanation for the appalling deception that he and his colleagues have practised for at least the past 12 months?

This Government has a proper concern for the welfare of this community and does not seek in any way to obtain political advantage from the economic misfortune that has visited upon this country. I contrast that attitude of this Government with the position of the Opposition, including particularly the Leader of the Opposition and other members of his party. I refer simply to two examples of the total irresponsibility of the Liberal Party in this country. I refer first of all to the now infamous interview with the Leader of the Opposition in the Australian Financial Review in which he said: `The times will suit me'. He looked at the deteriorating economic situation, and his words were: `The times will suit me'. He looks with eagerness to a deteriorating economic situation imposed upon his fellow countrymen by external circumstances.

        Perhaps the position of the Liberal Party, which the honourable gentleman leads, is best encapsulated by a letter which I wish to read to the House from a member of the Liberal Party, the honourable gentleman's Party, in Western Australia. I do not believe that members of the Australian community will be able to believe the truth of this, but I want it read fully into the record of this House so that the people of Australia will understand just where the Liberal Party puts the interests of this country. This letter was written by Mr Lightfoot, a Liberal member of the Western Australian Parliament, to George Shultz, the United States Secretary of State. He wrote:

        Firstly, you will enhance the tarnished image of our Prime Minister Hawke and restore his previously held omnipotence, and that would not be in the interests of free peoples in this hemisphere. Hawke would be written up in the Australian media as the man who coerced you and your president into changing your mind-and that leads into the second effect-it would further entrench the socialist system and may deny the conservative parties the right to govern in 1988-89 because of the arresting of the decline in the Australian dollar and the easing of our balance of payments.
       </para>
       <para>
        No doubt you have already considered the hypothesis here to before outlined. Your decision now, not to go ahead with the sales, would have profound effects on our forming a Government-at the next election. I therefore again urge you to stand fast on your decision.

        If there has ever been a more treacherous action and treasonable action by a political party in the history of this country I would like to hear it. Here is the Liberal Party deliberately asking the United States Administration to visit upon the farmers of this country a continuing burden, knowing that that will not only adversely affect the rural community of this country but also impose burdens upon the whole of Australia. So that it may enhance its chances of governing in a later period, here is the Liberal Party saying to the United States: `Punish Australia now, and punish it next year so that that increases our chances of governing'. I compare with pride the responsible attitudes of this Government and of our spokespersons with the miserable and treacherous attitude of the Opposition.

         —The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation has recently reorganised its water resources research through the formation of a CSIRO Division of Water Resources Research. Western Australian Ministers, particularly the Premier and the Deputy Premier, the West Australian Advisory Committee of the CSIRO and the West Australian-based CSIRO staff have made strong representations for the headquarters of the Division to be located in Perth. Canberra based staff, honourable members will be amazed to learn, have called for the headquarters to be located in the Australian Capital Territory.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        We are well aware that there is a serious historic under-representation of the CSIRO in Western Australia. The new Division of Water Resources Research will comprise the old Division of Groundwater Research in Perth, the Division of Water and Land Resources in Canberra and the hydrology group of the Division of Soils in Adelaide. About 200 staff are involved in the reorganisation and the Division will be responsible for developing CSIROs role in the nation's water resources research. Incidentally bringing it all together is a cause that the honourable member for Hawker has proposed for many years. Unfortunately, the honourable member is not with us this afternoon, but this move is a striking endorsement of something that he has wanted for so long.
       </para>
       <para>
        The new Division will deal with the maintenance of the quality and quantity of water supplies and the disposal of waste water. It will also work on projects of major national importance with substantial agency or user support. A world wide search for a chief of the new Division is under way and the Division will be established when the chief takes up his perch. I am glad the honourable member for Hawker is now with us. I was just saying that the establishment of the new Division of Water Resources Research is a tribute to a cause that he has pushed for a very long time. The bad news is that it will not be in his electorate; it will, in fact, be established in Perth. That is an earnest of our continuing determination to make sure the organisation is well represented in Perth, and I can assure honourable members that the West Australian Government is delighted by the outcome.

Subsequent to that, surprisingly for us as a government, the justices of the High Court issued a further Press statement saying that they did not really want to discuss that matter. They had discussed it, but they were not discussing it as a court. They merely wanted to know what might be Mr Justice Murphy's explanation.

That is of some surprise to me, in view of other information given to me at the time. This is the important part. There we have the justices of the High Court not objecting to sitting with their brother judge. It was understandable then that he was certainly of such a mind. In view of the fact that he had received this dreadful diagnosis and that he has to think of the welfare of his family and his children and what they might think of their father, what was wrong with the man exercising his discretion to go back to the Bench from which there was no need for him to withdraw?

Mr Justice Murphy is now considering six or seven reserve judgments in which he is obliged, naturally, to give his decision. On that basis, I understand that he is now seeking sick leave. That is a matter for the Court itself. In that process of time, it was thought that he would have sufficient time to complete those reserve judgments.

       <para>
        Regrettably, it appears that because of the diagnosis and the nature of the illness, he is weakening and therefore may not be able to resume sittings. I think when the medical evidence has been tabled, as it may, it will be conclusive as to that point. I would only hope, from the point of view of an ordinary human being and a fellow Australian, that there is a remission of his illness. I would hope that there is a chance that his health can be restored and that he can regain his position on the Court. He would then be able to meet any of the accusers that he may have, including those in the Opposition.

         —I have noted that agitation. Given the interest in the visa-free concept, particularly in the tourist industry, the Government has initiated a comprehensive assessment of the costs and benefits of the visa-free arrangement in the Australian context. I point out to the House that just because other countries find visa-free arrangements satisfactory does not mean that they will suit this country; we are in a unique situation in a number of ways. The whole issue is very complex. Further work has been done on this issue since the House last met. That work has addressed itself to the fact that visas do keep undesirable people out of this country, which is a very popular country for people to visit. For a start, over one million people want to come here every year for permanent residency and less than 100,000 places are available. This puts us in a very different situation from, for instance, Japan; there is no desire to any great extent on the part of people from outside Japan for permanent residence there.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        However, we will look at ways in which we can facilitate the tourist industry. But I ask the House to consider-I will be very pleased to receive any representation that any honourable member wishes to put to me on this issue-the fact that, if and when we do allow any visa-free arrangements of, say, a short term duration for tourists, we will have to be selective. We will have to select countries from which we do not take many permanent residents, countries from which there is not much demand for permanent residence. This will be tough and hard decisions will have to be taken as to the countries we will choose.
       </para>
       <para>
        I thank the honourable member for Rankin for allowing me to bring the House up to date on this matter. However, we will continue to give good service where visas are necessary, which is from everywhere but New Zealand. We aim to give a 48-hour turnaround service. We will look at helping the tourist industry by selectively allowing visa-free arrangements if these are at all possible.

         —It is fascinating to note on the resumption of this Parliament that the Opposition is not only treacherous to the economic interest of this country but also totally lacking in any semblance of decency and good taste. Nevertheless, I will respond to the second question in this area that has been pressed by the Opposition. There are two separate issues relating to the costs incurred by Mr Justice Murphy. That will probably be clear to most members of the House. The first concerns his costs arising out of the conduct of the Parliamentary Commission of Inquiry established by this Parliament. The second relates to his costs in defending criminal prosecutions.
        </para>

       <para>
        As to the first, in accordance with the provisions of the Parliamentary Commission of Inquiry Act, the Attorney-General has authorised the payment of the Judge's costs relating to the operation of the Commission. He did so following a request from the President and from yourself, Madam Speaker, on 2 June that these costs be met. Under the Act the Attorney-General is required to comply with that request. As yet no accounts have been received.
       </para>
       <para>
        As to the second, the costs of defending the criminal prosecution matters, the Acting Attorney-General, Senator Gareth Evans, said on 1 August, in announcing the Government's decision:

        I conclude by saying that the Government has not yet looked in detail at this matter and has not decided at this stage what the appropriate payment will be. As far as the Government is concerned, that is all that will be said on this matter at this stage.

         —There are three points to be made: First of all the decision was made on health grounds on the advice of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee which provides recommendations as to which drugs should go on the essential drug list in this country. Its advice in relation to the 46 formulations we are now discussing was that these were not drugs that could be justified on that essential drug list on grounds of their minor therapeutic effect. That is the first point.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The second point that needs to be made in relation to this question is that concern has been expressed on both sides of the House and by medical authorities about the increase in the usage of drugs by pensioners in this country. It has been rising in the last three years by close to 20 per cent a year. If we are to provide free essential drugs to pensioners, certainly the lists have to be looked at in relation to inessential drugs. It will not be possible for any government to go on providing free drugs for pensioners unless those drugs are seen as essential drugs. That is another reason for looking at that parti-cular list.
       </para>
       <para>
        Thirdly, the point needs to be made that nearly all of these drugs are drugs which are obtainable without prescription that is, they are simply across-the-counter drugs which can be bought for $2 and $3 or sometimes from the supermarkets for even less. But the present scheme means that in order for a pensioner to get that drug free he has to go to a doctor and get a consultation at a cost to the taxpayer of some $13. If the drug is then on prescription an extra $2.40 has to be paid as a dispensing fee to the pharmacist. So the taxpayer finishes up paying $16 or $17 for drugs available across the counter for $2 or $3.

If indeed there is a very large transaction which threatens to destabilise the rate, sometimes such a transaction is balanced off. Over the course of July the bank did spend considerable funds in the foreign exchange market. I do not think the bank or the Government regards that in any way as any long term solution to what is happening in the exchange markets; hence, the importance of tonight's Budget and the importance the Government places on seeing fundamental change in the structure of economic policy. But again the bank is following its normal role, that is, operating in the foreign exchange market as best and when it sees fit in respect of particular events. Over that period the exchange rate fell dramatically on a couple of days and the bank would be doing less than its task in not engaging in the foreign exchange market at that time. Certainly I concur with the import of the honourable gentleman's question. The Government would not regard simply throwing reserves at the rate as a solution to the exchange rate.

         —There have been a number of proposals, two quite prominent ones, to establish private universities for full fee paying students. The honourable member will be aware that some time ago the Government announced that it had approved the policy to existing tertiary institutions, that is, the ones funded by the Commonwealth, to admit overseas full fee paying students on the basis of fairly strict guidelines which would ensure that the full cost of providing the places for those overseas students would be met by the fees paid to them.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The Government has decided not to extend this arrangement to Australians because the basic reason for providing these new arrangements is to provide an opportunity for essentially the export of education services to students from other countries, particularly those in the region. We have been able to identify a substantial market, particularly within the region, in competition with universities in Britain, United States of America and other places. I would expect that over the years we will see a fairly substantial growth in the number of full fee paying students entering Australia to undertake the courses. However, this has to be done with some sensitivity to ensure that there is a minimum of disruption to the ordinary ongoing work of the institutions themselves. In regard to fully private institutions, the Government does not intend to provide any support to these proposals. We are, however, intending to examine these proposals to ensure again that there is no disruption to the general provision of tertiary education services within Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        There is one other point I should make, and that is that as part of the policies announced by myself and the Minister for Education in relation to this matter, we have decided to examine, on a case by case basis, any proposals which involve the development of joint facilities between private and public institutions. If there is an intention of a university or college to get together with some private interests to provide these full fee paying courses for overseas students the Government would want to consider it on the basis of the proposals that are put up to us.

Needless to say, the Government is totally opposed to this log of claims. In present circumstances it is difficult to imagine a more damaging action by any section of the Australian economy than for a union to pursue wage increases of this kind which are blatantly in breach of the accord and of the national wage fixing principles. I have conveyed the Government's strong opposition to this course of action to the Plumbers and Gasfitters Employees Union which, nevertheless, is apparently determined to pursue this course. I have informed the union that if it proceeds the Government will take every step possible to ensure that it does not succeed because, as I have pointed out to the Union, if it were to succeed its action would certainly result in grave damage to this economy, and there would certainly be adverse effects on the exchange rate and interest rates. There would be a much higher level of unemployment if we were to have a wages blow-out in this area, spreading as it inevitably would to other areas of the building industry and then to the rest of the economy.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        We are determined to resist this claim, and I point out that building industry employers have a strong obligation also to resist it. I have pointed out to employers today that the government's code of conduct, which was established in the builders Labourers Federation case, will apply in relation to the Plumbers and Gasfitters Employees Union claims. Essentially that code of conduct provides that building employers are bound to adhere to awards, industrial agreements and the national wage fixing principles. If they do not adhere to those matters, the government can take action against them to disqualify them from future government contracts. This tactic was used successfully by us in respect of the BLF and I expect that it would be successful if we needed to use it again. I believe that everything must be done to oppose these claims, which are extremely damaging. I regret greatly that the union has seen fit to go ahead with the claims. I note that it is doing so in isolation-that no other union affiliated with the Australian Council of Trade Unions, or indeed not affiliated, is pursuing this course. I advise the House that we expect that the Plumbers and Gasfitters Employees Union will fail; the trade union movement of this country will demonstrate that it is a sensible organisation which is prepared to act to ensure the recovery of this nation, to get us out of the difficult circumstance we are in presently; and the accord will continue through difficult times to help this economy to get back to strong economic growth.

         —It is not the only lousy thing about the place, is it? Seriously, it is a tragedy to think that legislation passed through the House of Representatives has been deliberately delayed in the Senate for reasons that have nothing to do with the content of the Bill, but for the purpose of delaying its introduction. I accept the fact that the Bill would require introduction and certainly some opportunity to allow it to work before public opinion could accept some of the extraordinary interpretations that have been given to it, particularly by the people opposite.

        I want to make this point: At the present time the Senate has failed to deal with 27 other Bills that have already been passed by this House. One wonders how we will get the Senate to devote its time to what it is supposed to be doing; that is, reviewing legislation as a House of review. It is becoming a House of delay and obstruction. Having said that, the Bill will not be proceeded with. Something will need to be done about the problems we have in terms of obligations under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.

         —The honourable gentleman says that we can forget them, too. As we are a signatory to that covenant with 79 other nations and we have a responsibility in the international sphere to monitor the position of human rights in Australia, there will need to be a commission that will deal not only with the monitoring aspects of the Covenant but also with the obligations we have in respect of the International Labour Organisation Convention on equal opportunity and the questions of race discrimination and sex discrimination under existing legislation. There will be a restructuring of the Commission. I have set in motion a task force to look at what sorts of people will be needed to assist that Commission. I accept the view that there will be a need for people who are directly related to those responsibilities and they will be fewer in number than is the case with the present Commission.

         —My question, which is addressed to the Minister for Primary Industry, follows what the Prime Minister was talking about concerning the outrageous Lightfoot letter. I ask the Minister: Is it true that, if Mr Lightfoot's exhortation to the American Government leads to a continuation of its policies, not only wheat growers but also cotton, sugar, rice and the soya beans-competing lupin growers will be affected? I further ask whether it is important for the salvation of the Australian industry that we maintain a bipartisan approach to the Americans on this issue of dumping. In that context, would it be important for the honourable member for O'Connor, who has an electorate very largely devoted to wheat growing and who was feigning boredom through the Prime Minister's answer, to dissociate himself from Mr Lightfoot's remarks?

         —Lightfoot and big mouth. I would like to comment on the latter part of the honourable gentleman's question because a recent all-party delegation went to Washington with a truly bipartisan if not tripartisan approach and we were all there for Australia.

       </talk.start>
       <para>
        I hope that Mr Lightfoot's comments do not represent a change of view, given the seriousness with which we regarded the Dole amendment to the export-import Bill in the United States Senate and the Daschle Bill itself. The initial United States subsidisation proposals-the Dole and Daschle proposals-could have cost Australian wheat growers $470m this year on top of the $1 billion that the United States Farm Act has already been calculated to have cost us.
       </para>
       <para>
        I find it difficult to imagine anything more reprehensible than for people in the Opposition parties to be seriously saying that they want to see this continuation of a detrimental trade effect to enhance the Liberal Party's and their own electoral prospects. Already the Leader of the Opposition has said that he is relying on an economic recession for his political salvation. I would simply like to say that, under this Government, honourable members opposite will get neither a recession nor their salvation.
       </para>
       <para>
        The honourable gentleman also asked a question about crops other than wheat. With respect to cotton and rice, one element of the United States farm program-the target export assistance program rather than the export enhancement program-will have an even more insidious and more devastating effect than some of the other measures under its farm program.
       </para>
       <para>
        With respect to sugar I do not think we can point the finger so much at the United States, even though it subsidises sugar production at US18c a pound and the world price is US6c a pound. But the main cause of the problem in the sugar industry still remains with the European Economic Community where its degree and level of subsidisation are even more pronounced. Of course, I think we all regard with dismay, and I am sure that the Deputy Leader of the National Party and his colleague the honourable member for Hume regard with dismay, the fact that when we came back we had this fire sale proposition to China of sugar at a little bit over US4c a pound.
       </para>
       <para>
        All these things add up to an immense cost to Australian farmers and, as this Government has been trying to make quite clear, Australia's farm problems are very much a part of Australia's economic problem-that is, the problem with out balance of payments-and that is the reason why we have problems with our dollar. All these things are interdependent. I would have thought that all people in this House, when they are abroad and when they are reflecting on international matters, would speak with one voice rather than utter this damnable reprehensible nonsense.

I never have, and I want to make that perfectly plain. There is not a single statement that can be pointed to in support of that assertion. That is the first point. The second is that it was said that I had, to my credit, first issued a Press statement saying that we would not pursue the matter any further. If that is to be understood as referring to general issues concerning Mr Justice Murphy's conduct, that was not correct. If it is to be understood as referring to the specific issues dealt with at the criminal trial, it is. The statement that I issued was directed only to questions based on the specific issues dealt with in the criminal trial, as appears from the statement of 29 April 1986.

       Family Allowances

       To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned shows:
      </para>
      <para>
       Graduated family allowances are of important assistance to families with more than one child.
      </para>
      <para>
       All family allowances, whether for one, two, three, or more children, have not kept pace with inflation.
      </para>
      <para>
       There are suggestions that all family allowances should be paid at the one flat rate. This would severely disadvantage families with more than one child.
      </para>
      <para>
       There are also suggestions that the dependent spouse rebate be reduced or removed. This would represent another blow to the family unit.
      </para>
      <para>
       Your petitioners therefore pray that the House of Representatives, in Parliament assembled, should:
      </para>
      <para>
       ask the Federal Government to increase the value of existing family allowance payments, and
      </para>
      <para>
       reject any moves to change the payments to a flat rate or to tamper with the spouse rebate;

       To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled. The petition of certain citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:
      </para>
      <para>
       That taxpayers with dependent children have been gravely disadvantaged by a serious decline in the level of recognition provided in the taxation system for the costs of maintaining a family, in particular:
      </para>
      <para>
       the failure to index family allowances which has resulted in an erosion of more than 50 per cent in their real value since May 1976;
      </para>
      <para>
       the abolition of family allowances for dependents who have turned 18, even those still at school;
      </para>
      <para>
       the abolition of concessional tax rebates for education and other expenses.
      </para>
      <para>
       That this erosion in horizontal tax equity has placed an intolerable financial burden on many larger families, particularly those on middle incomes who fail to qualify for means-tested benefits such as TEAS but whose living standards are now well below average due to heavy expenses on necessities such as education, housing, food and clothing.
      </para>
      <para>
       Your petitioners humbly pray that:
      </para>
      <para>
       family allowances be restored to the 1976 value (in real terms), and indexed according to the CPI;
      </para>
      <para>
       the dependent spouse rebate be retained;
      </para>
      <para>
       The Federal Government take urgent measures to restore equitable provisions in the taxation system through the introduction of family income splitting.
      </para>
      <para>
       And your petitioners, as in duty bound, will ever pray.

       Closure of Post Office Agencies

      <para>
       To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled. The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:
      </para>
      <para>
       That we strenuously object to the proposal that many Post Office Agencies are to be closed. They provide a network of offices with postal and agency services to residential areas and small communities.
      </para>
      <para>
       They serve a community need and we would be seriously inconvenienced if forced to travel further to purchase postal items or collect parcels. It would be an unnecessary expense particularly for pensioners without their own transport. We maintain that the purpose of Post Offices should be to serve the public for the variety of services they offer. They are a community centre particularly in country areas and if necessary they should be subsidised to retain them.
      </para>
      <para>
       Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the House should take all possible steps to prevent the closure of Post Office Agencies and that the network should be extended, with the Agency services they offer expanded.

       2. They are aware it properly reflects the immutable characteristics of Australia, namely:
      </para>
      <para>
       (a) The Union Jack, itself the creation of three Christian Crosses, represents the Nation's historical origin and the source of its language and law;
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) The Southern Cross on an azure blue background signifying its geographical location on this planet Earth;
      </para>
      <para>
       (c) The large star depicting the advent of Federation in 1901.
      </para>
      <para>
       3. They know the flag has been a source of inspiration to generations of Australians in peace and war.
      </para>
      <para>
       4. The recall that millions of native-born Australians and newcomers to these shore from other parts of the world have become united under its proud symbolism.
      </para>
      <para>
       5 They are certain that any change to the Flag will produce division in the Australian community.

       3. The present Australian national flag does not properly represent Australia as a sovereign, independent nation.
      </para>
      <para>
       4. The present Australian national flag falsely proclaims Australia as a colony, homeland, protectorate, dominion or government department of Great Britain.
      </para>
      <para>
       5. The first condition in the flag competition of 1901 required that the design should show Australia's loyalty to the British Empire. The British Empire no longer exists.
      </para>
      <para>
       6. A public opinion poll held in 1984 using the Gallup Method revealed that 52% of Australians surveyed wanted a competition for a new design for the Australian flag.
      </para>
      <para>

This body will enable us to maximize existing financial, material, and human resources, and is the least expensive way of implementing urgently needed maintenance programmes.

       4. Action against U.S.A. Bases in Australia is overdue and urgent. They endanger world peace and are an outrageous violation of Australia's National Sovereignty.

       that such a moratorium would create a favourable climate and basis for the negotiation of a Comprehensive Nuclear Test Ban Treaty

       1. The Sex Discrimination Act, passed by Parliament in 1984, will automatically make unenforceable from 1st August 1986 the weight lifting limits applicable to women employees and contained in State laws, regulations and awards.
      </para>
      <para>
       2. These weight lifting limits have applied throughout Australia for many years and have acted to prevent many injuries at the workplace, thereby avoiding much suffering and loss of working time.
      </para>
      <para>
       3. The removal of this protective legislation will increase the rate of injury among women employees and lead to greater Workers' Compensation costs for employers.

       We, the undersigned, plead that Parliament becomes aware that the Public has no legal right to influence the setting of Standards for Television Programming, that we deplore the new Standards which came into force on 1st February, and that we call on Parliament to amend the Broadcasting and Television Act 1942, section 16 (2), so that the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal, when determining Television Standards, and screening hours, shall consult with the Australian people:

      <para>
       because at present the Tribunal is compelled by law to consult only with television stations on these matters.

       because the new standards are a result of such consultation, and have already been implemented without public discussion,

      </para>
      <para>
       We are appalled that the prison authorities have demanded-
      </para>
      <para>
       Women prisoners in Armagh Gaol to be strip searched up to 32 times more frequently, on average, than women prisoners in Britain.
      </para>
      <para>
       Individual women prisoners in Armagh to be strip searched up to 28 times in one month.
      </para>
      <para>
       The occasional participation of male prison officers in forcing women to undergo strip searches.
      </para>
      <para>
       The insistence that menstruating women remove their sanitary towels and tampons, in order to facilitate strip searches.
      </para>
      <para>
       The strip searches currently being practised are violent, degrading and humiliating. They are a blatant violation of human rights, clearly contravening Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights. Your petitioners gravely feel that the employment of strip searching in the North of Ireland, by the British Government is designed not for security purposes but to dehumanise and violate the basic dignity of these women prisoners.

       Your petitioners humbly call upon the Australian Government to lodge a protest with the British Government, calling upon the British Government and the Northern Ireland Office to discontinue the practice of strip searching women prisoners in Armagh Gaol in Northern Ireland immediately.

       That in January 1983 the Latvian born nursing sister Lidija Lasmane-Doronina was arrested by the Soviet authorities and subsequently sentenced to sixteen years in a strict regime enforced labour camp with an additional three years in exile. She had been charged with maintaining contact with Baptists abroad and for being in possession of a copy of the 1975 Helsinki Accords and of having a list of the Soviet Union's transgressions of them.

The Post Office serves a community need and we would be seriously inconvenienced by having to travel to another centre for our postal and banking requirements, or even to collect registered, certified letters and parcels. Many of us are pensioners and the cost of such travel would be an unnecessary imposition. The nearest Post Offices are about 2kms away with no convenient public transport.

      <para>
       S.W.A.P.O. is recognised by the United Nations as the sole and authentic representative of the Namibian people.
      </para>
      <para>
       The situation in Namibia is of particular importance to Australians, given Australia's position as a member of the United Nations Council for Namibia, in effect a member of the UN, the government for Namibia in exile and therefore has a legal international entrusted responsibility to the people of Namibia, responsibilities which it must be prepared to take seriously in order to bring about social justice, freedom and independence for Namibia and genuine peace in that Region.
      </para>
      <para>
       Therefore this humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully requests the Government to urgently initiate the following steps:
      </para>
      <para>
       1. To fund a S.W.A.P.O. Office in Australia, such funding to continue until a free Namibia is able to establish an Embassy in Canberra.
      </para>
      <para>
       2. That all commercial, sporting and cultural ties with the Republic of South Africa be severed forthwith.
      </para>
      <para>
       3. That all diplomatic ties with Pretoria be severed.
      </para>

       Discrimination against Women

      <para>
       To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives assembled:
      </para>
      <para>
       The Petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth:
      </para>
      <para>
       That whereas the Commonwealth of Australia ratified with the UN Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women in 1983, the Government of Victoria in passing the Planning (Brothels) Act 1984 is in breach of Article 6 of the Convention which says that ``States Parties shall take all appropriate measures, including legislation, to suppress all forms of traffic in women and exploitation of prostitution of women''.
      </para>
      <para>
       That the Victorian Planning (Brothels) Act 1984 provides legal authority to brothel operators to traffic in and exploit the prostitution of women and to live off the earnings of prostitutes.
      </para>
      <para>
       That whereas the Federal Minister for Health has counselled citizens to shun promiscuity (The Australian 26/1/85) because of the serious and sometimes fatal health hazards, the operations of legalised brothels encourages promiscuity and the spread of diseases, including AIDS.
      </para>
      <para>
       Your petitioners therefore pray that the Government of Australia having ratified the UN Convention on Women remain consistent in its obligations to uphold the Articles of the Convention and request the Victorian Government to immediately repeal the Planning (Brothels) Act 1984.

       Plant Variety Rights

       To the Honourable the Speaker and Members of the House of Representatives in Parliament assembled:
      </para>
      <para>
       We the undersigned citizens of the Commonwealth do humbly pray that the Commonwealth government:
      </para>
      <para>
       1. Uphold the principle that the seeds and cuttings of plants are a public resource and a common heritage to all and that accordingly seeds should be freely available to all, freely multipliable, able to be sold, exchanged, exported and imported by anyone who wishes. This is seen as a matter of national food security.
      </para>
      <para>
       2. Recognize that plant breeding is a highly co-operative venture often involving private enterprise at the very last stages after basic seed collection, storage, and research has been publicly funded.
      </para>
      <para>
       3. In view of the aforementioned paragraphs, recognize that any system giving `property' or ownership rights over seeds to individuals, organisations or enterprises is inappropriate and unjust.
      </para>
      <para>
       4. Recognize that legislation establishing plant patenting schemes overseas has had serious adverse effects namely:
      </para>
      <para>
       (i) a slowing-down of scientific information exchange and exchanges in basic plant breeding materials, that is, germ plasm,
      </para>

       (ii) subordination and/or curtailment of public breeding programmes,

      <para>
       (iii) farmer unrest at seed prices,
      </para>
      <para>
       (iv) monopoly control of seed production and sales has passed into the hands of giant petrochemical and drug corporations also marketing crop chemicals,
      </para>
      <para>
       (v) increased uniformity of crop varieties leading to a vulnerability to pest and disease attack.
      </para>
      <para>
       5. Reject any proposal to legislate for any system such as the drafted Plant Variety Rights Act, which gives exclusive ownership rights over seeds to individuals, organisations or enterprises.

       Chernobyl Nuclear Disaster

Neither have the appropriate medicines for substitution therapies to minimise bodily accumulation of radioactive elements been adequately provided.
      </para>
      <para>
       2. That the Soviet Union operates many nuclear power stations without the elementary structural safeguards against radioactive spillage regarded as mandatory in the West. Of particular concern is the safety of the largest Soviet nuclear power station at Ignalina in Soviet occupied Lithuania, of similar design to Chernobyl, which already has a record of operational problems. Radioactive spillage at Ignalina would quickly contaminate the whole of Latvia, Lithuania as well as vast areas of Europe.

         —Last week and this week the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) came out of his Budget bunker to tell the Australian people that Australia was in a state of economic crisis. He told us that we were to have a tough Budget, a fall in living standards, and a cut in real wages, and that there would have to be all-round sacrifices. The Prime Minister went on the 60 Minutes program on Sunday night and said `The party is over-finito'. But whose party was it in the first place? Who started the binge in the first place? Who declared that it was a party in the first place? Who squandered Australia's resources over three years of a business upswing, and who then has the hide to come and tell the Australian people that the party he started in the first place is now over?
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The Prime Minister said that the present economic crisis was akin to a state of war in Australia. I ask the Prime Minister: `Whose side are you on in this war?' Who started the assault on the Australian economy in 1974, when, as President of the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the Prime Minister was responsible for the highest level of strikes in Australia's history, the greatest single wage increase in one year that we have ever seen-35 per cent in one year-which, at one stroke, destroyed hundreds of thousands of jobs in Australian industry, businesses, farms and individuals? The assault in this war on our economy was begun by the Prime Minister in 1974 and it has been continued by Hawke, Keating, Crean and their mates over the last few years. The case that my colleague the member for Parkes (Mr Cobb) and I will put here this afternoon in this chamber is that this economic crisis is tragically unnecessary. It is brought about not by any external assault on the Australian economy, but by the recklessness followed by the deception and negligence of the Hawke-Keating Administration.

       <para>
        Let me take the House back for a moment to 1983, because it was back in 1983 that the present phase of the assault on the economy began. It was in this very chamber in April 1983 that the Treasurer (Mr Keating) stood up and told the assembled group here and the nation on television that the Government's economic strategy had two principal elements. The first of these was to bring about a more rapid rate of recovery than would otherwise be possible by spending and borrowing at a much higher rate than any government in Australia's peacetime history. That was the first principal mistake. It was to drive the Australian economy at a higher rate than any of the economies in the developed world and to do it on borrowed money. That was mistake No. 1. Mistake No. 2 was to link wages to inflation. This was an insane step when the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and all its member countries were advising against it and when the experience of developed economies over the previous decade had shown that linking wages to inflation was a disastrous policy. But the Treasurer adopted these two elements of policy as central to Labor's economic strategy. It was inevitable that if we were to do that-given the basic incapacity in many respects of Australian industry to adapt quickly-we would run into serious balance of payments problems, and indeed we did.
       </para>
       <para>
        These balance of payments problems started to become very clear last year and they were exacerbated by a deterioration in Australia's terms of trade. I mention this because the deterioration in terms of trade is being used as the Government's alibi for all its mistakes. But Australia has had deteriorations in the terms of trade before. We have also had other external shocks. We have had massive rises in the price of oil on two occasions; we have had a terrible deterioration in the world economy on a number of occasions; and we have had very bad droughts on a number of occasions. But one way or another we have managed to cope with those external pressures and disasters and get the economy back on the track. This time the Government is trying to use the deterioration in the terms of trade as an excuse for the fundamental mistakes it made in economic strategy in 1983. It was inevitable, regardless of what happened to the terms of trade, that if one did what the Treasurer did, one would run into massive balance of payments problems. Indeed, we did.
       </para>
       <para>
        When did the deterioration become evident? Certainly it was evident to the Treasurer-at least on the terms of trade side-in the last Budget. I quote from Budget Paper No. 1 page 73, of last August:
       </para>
       <para>
        A marked deterioration in the terms of trade is expected, reflecting primarily the relative weakness of world prices for our commodity-based products.

         —That was a year ago and that was the first clear sign given to us by the Treasurer himself that Australia should brace itself for terms of trade problems. Other things became clear shortly after that. In October of last year we had a record balance of payments deficit of $1.6 billion. That was a very serious set of figures. The rest of the world could see what was going on, the Opposition was drawing attention to what was going on and a few economic observers and commentators in Australia were prepared to rock the Keating band-wagon and point out what was going on. People in the foreign capitals knew what was going on even earlier in February 1985. They had marked the Australian dollar down by 25 per cent following the Prime Minister's MX missile fiasco. But it was the underlying economics of the situation which originally led to the fall in the dollar. It was triggered by a perception that the Prime Minister was not fully in control of his Government. By the end of 1985 everybody around the world knew the fundamentals of the Australian economy. They knew exactly what would happen to it as a result of the Hawke-Keating policies because in November they marked the dollar down again.

         —We are referring then to the Prime Minister and the Treasurer and their combined disastrous economic policies. I was referring to the fact that in November last year, because nothing had been done about the terrible balance of payments figures in October and nothing had been done as a result of terrible inflation figures or about excessive wage settlements in October, the dollar was marked down again on foreign markets. Indeed, it was marked down at the very time the Treasurer was travelling to New York and London to try to talk it up. The dollar dropped when the Treasurer went to New York. It dropped again when he went to London. It dropped because the foreign markets knew-they knew last November-that the game was up. The Government panicked and pushed up interest rates to their highest level since the Great Depression. Every small businessman, every farmer and every home owner with a mortgage lives to rue the day last November when the Government had to resort to a high interests rates policy because of the crumbling of its fiscal and wages policies. That happened last November. So everybody externally knew about this, but apparently the Government did not.

        On 3 January the Opposition put out its four point plan to arrest this situation and to get the economy back on track. It is to the eternal discredit of this Government that it did not accept any of that advice in January. Let the Australian people know that had the Government accepted that advice in January we would not have the need for a tough Budget tonight. The Government did not accept our proposals, which provided for a cut in Government spending; abandonment of the wages and productivity case then before the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission; removal of the anti-business tax policies-the fringe benefits tax, the capital gains tax and all that other rubbish; and a relaxation of foreign investment controls. These proposals, which I remind honourable members were made in January of this year, were ridiculed by the Treasurer and the Prime Minister. The tragedy of this situation is that many more people will be out of jobs, will lose their farms and businesses and will suffer supreme hardship because of the failure of the Prime Minister and the Treasurer to heed our advice in January. I merely quote something the Treasurer said in response to what we were saying as late as March. He said:

        Now we come to the really scandalous part of this, because on 9 May-only a few months ago-the Treasurer went to the Economic Planning Advisory Council, the main advisory body, and said:
       </para>
       <para>
        Overall, 1986 is emerging as a year of slower, but still satisfactory growth, a year in which we will see consolidation of the very strong gains of the past three years and--

        in which the economy can deal with the imbalance on our external account.
       </para>
       <para>
        That was on 9 May. Five days later, one day after disastrous balance of payments figures were released, we had gone from that supreme position to a banana republic. On 14 May the Treasurer said that we were going down the shute. Obviously, if any more evidence were needed that this was a planned campaign of deception of the Australian community, it has to be provided by the juxtaposition of those two statements because one of them has to be an untruth. One of them has to be totally deceptive. I ask honourable members: Which of those statements is totally deceptive?
       </para>
       <para>
        Then there was the period of negligence. Did the Government do anything about the situation even in May? No, it did not. The Prime Minister decided to make a public address to the nation on television. So he did and he called for sacrifice. About a week later his mates in the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia responded to this call for national effort and sacrifice by closing the docks for a week. That is what happened. Then, still ignoring the requirement for a mini-Budget, still ignoring the request to cut back on wages, members of the Australian Labor Party went down to their national conference in Hobart and conducted a sham battle against the Left. But the enemy was on their side because while they were in Hobart talking about economic responsibility, Mr Sword, Mr Crean's successor as head of the Federated Storeman and Packers Union, was bringing Melbourne and Sydney to a halt by cutting off their petrol supplies just to demonstrate that union's economic responsibility. The tragedy of this economic crisis which is what it is; there is no doubt about it-is that it need never have happened. The warnings were there. The warnings were in the Government's own publications if people had looked deeply enough into them. The warnings were there for foreign observers and were provided by the Opposition. But time and again the Government would not respond and, as a result, it stands condemned and will be responsible for the hardships that it will inflict on the Australian people for the rest of this year and beyond.

No wonder the honourable member for Wentworth (Mr Coleman) is being pressed out of this place in order that Professor John Huson can come in and take over as shadow Treasurer. We have certainly just heard 15 minutes of a very pathetic effort which would make that at least something worthwhile for this Parliament. Nobody could do a worse job.

        One of the many contrasts between the Hawke Labor Government and the coalition Opposition relates to credibility. Credibility is a very important word in politics-a very important concept. This matter of public importance before the House today should be examined with that word `credibility' in mind. We need just to look at the words in the matter of public importance. Let us just drag some of them out-emotional words such as `recklessness', `deception' and `negligence'. They show a very small mind and certainly show the hypocrisy of the Opposition when it talks in those sorts of terms. It is not something that is worthy of this Parliament. If we want to have a look at irresponsibility let us look at those words such as `recklessness', `deception' and `negligence' and let us just consider for a moment what their real meaning is. Let us just consider those words in terms of the Opposition's behaviour at Question Time today. Opposition members were so reckless, at a time when we have had two months recess from this place, that they brought into this Parliament not the grave concerns that there are at this time of economic difficulties for this country-they did not bring in such major concerns basically at Question Time-but matters relating to Mr Justice Lionel Murphy and his position. They brought in matters such as the discredited National Times article on the Treasurer (Mr Keating). They are the sorts of things that they have raised. If they want recklessness that certainly gives us an idea of what recklessness is.

         —As the honourable member for Melbourne has just said, they are pursuing gutter politics and that is what we ought to be nailing on them. In talking about recklessness I note more significantly the example of the recklessness of the former Treasurer, the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) and the $9.6 billion blowout in the last Budget that he sought to bring to this country. That is what recklessness means.

       <para>
        Let us look at the word `deception'. What about the Opposition being in favour of tax cuts on the one hand but being unable or unwilling to identify any major cuts in expenditure on the other hand? I just need to point out to the House that the Leader of the Opposition's promise to abolish the fringe benefits tax, the capital gains tax, the tax on lump sum superannuation payouts and the assets test would add an annual cost to the Budget of no less than $940m. How does anybody who pretends to be credible, reconcile that tax cut-type rhetoric with the expenditure promises made by the same Leader of the Opposition and his shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Mackellar, from whom we have just heard, when they list their wanted expenditure cuts to the order of $1.5 billion? Since then the National Party of Australia has gone haywire and has promised a further $500m package of goodies for the rural sector. That gives us some idea of the lack of credibility of the people opposite.
       </para>
       <para>
        If the Leader of the Opposition sadly ever took over as leader of the Government of this country there are only two ways in which he could finance his tax cuts and expenditure promises. The first would be irresponsibly to increase the deficit, as he did as Federal Treasurer in 1982-83 when the Liberals were thrown out of office with an election eve deficit projection, as I mentioned earlier, of $9.6 billion. The second would be to hold a massive sale of public sector assets such as Telecom Australia and the Commonwealth Bank in the same way as the Leader of the Opposition in my home State of South Australia wanted to do during his unsuccessful 1985 State election campaign and, indeed, as the Thatcher Government is doing in the United Kingdom. If we want credibility let us hear from the shadow Treasurer, the honourable member for Mackellar, in this House as to exactly what the Opposition would be doing in these circumstances. Instead we have these massive giveaways by way of promises relating to tax cuts on the one hand and promises of increased expenditure, such as the irresponsible $500m package of the National Party on the other hand. As I have said, all the Opposition has come up with is increases. So we can put in one phrase that it is reckless, deceptive and negligent.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Opposition's total and blatant hypocrisy in bringing this matter of public importance forward is evident, therefore, from the words of the matter itself. In contrast, let me say, in as measured a way as I possibly can, that the Government has a balanced and coherent strategy. This strategy will work and we have no intention of altering it. Of course, the strategy will be explained in further detail tonight when the Treasurer talks to the House and to the nation when giving his 1986-87 Budget Speech.
       </para>
       <para>
        Since this Government came to office we have made fundamental reforms aimed at restructuring the debilitated economy we inherited. Let me go through some of those reforms which will mean a far better structure for us to revive this country's economy in the near future. Deregulating the financial markets so that we have an efficient and innovative financial sector is just one of those reforms. We are ready now to respond to the needs of entrepreneurs in the business community generally. On the other hand, the coalition parties when in government could only aspire to deregulation but they never did things. Without floating the dollar we would never have had the depreciation that this country so desperately needs. This economy has needed it. For 20 years we have had an over-valued dollar and the result of an over-valued dollar was the decimation of our manufacturing industry. Now a whole range of previously uncompetitive industries is competitive again, particularly and most importantly our manufacturing industry.
       </para>
       <para>
        We brought down the most fundamental and far-reaching post-war tax reform despite the dishonest and self-interested bleatings of people in the Opposition. The rorts have been removed and still more will be removed. Personal marginal tax rates will be lowered and the company tax system reformed to remove the double taxation of dividends. The coalition always talked of tax reforms but it never did anything about them. Of course, the leader of the Opposition presided over the most scandalous explosion of tax avoidance and evasion that this country has ever experienced. He could not or would not do anything about it then, and now he has lost his chance forever, I am glad to be able to say for the sake of this country.
       </para>
       <para>
        I shall say something about wages policy. We have negotiated the accords marks I and II under which over 600,000 new jobs have been created, reducing the unemployment rate from over 10 per cent to just over 8 per cent and this occurred despite an increase in the participation rate to record levels, We have had three years of strong, positive and real growth in the economy, thanks to the accords mark I and II. Let us contrast that with the promised actions of the Opposition. It would have us having a market for wages. It would have us having a situation such as that which is being demonstrated by the plumbers and gas fitters right now with what they are seeking to impose on Australia-namely, a breakout from the accord. It would have us determining wages in the law of the jungle with the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer. That is the sort of wages determination policy that it would have, and it would be in such strong contrast to the accord.
       </para>
       <para>
        I pay tribute to the trade union movement, which has been the other great party to the accord. It has meant that those in the work force have made their sacrifices in wage restraint for those outside the work force. Without that restraint and without the accord, we would not have had the great advance in creating over 600,000 new jobs. There is a sharp contrast between the coalition's policies and ours in relation to the manufacturing sector. We even had an interjection from the honourable member for Forde (Dr Watson) about our currency being undervalued now. I think that that was the effect of his intervention. He certainly suggested that he did not agree with me saying that our currency had been overvalued. I say to him that it is necessary to look only at the lack of competitiveness in our manufacturing industry to realise that that is not so. The need was there to do something about an overvalued dollar, and now that we have done so we shall be in a position to re-industrialise this country.
       </para>
       <para>
        Under the Opposition's policies we had double-digit unemployment, with hundreds of thousands of families thrown into poverty. Under those policies we had double-digit inflation as well, and we had a blow-out in the deficit. I have mentioned the deficit of $9.6 billion that we inherited. We had industrial disputes three times higher than they are now. Company profits were destroyed and there was accordingly a lack of investment. We had a 17 per cent wages blow-out.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let me contrast that with the fine record of achievement during the three years of the Hawke Labor Government, I am proud to be able to remind the House of the results of our economic management. Real gross domestic product had declined by nearly one per cent in 1982-83, the last year of the previous Government. Over the past three years it has averaged an annual growth rate of 4.7 per cent. I have mentioned employment increasing and unemployment falling. Australia has one of the best records in this and in industrial disputation statistics of any other country in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. Generally, living standards have increased.
       </para>
       <para>
        I repeat that the Government has a fine record. I remind the House once again of what has happened in this latest crisis which we are addressing, and that is the decline in the terms of trade. Last year alone the figures fell by 14 per cent, to a post-depression low. The honourable member for Barton (Mr Punch) who will be speaking after me, will give some examples of what this has meant in the decline in the prices that we are getting for many of our products that we export. For instance, between 1981-82 and 1985-86, average coal export prices fell from $US54.85 a tonne to $US39.41 a tonne, a fall of 28 per cent. The most recent price is about $US38.72 a tonne. I could go on. The honourable member for Barton may find time to talk about wheat, wool, iron ore, alumina, beef and other items. He may have time to give examples of how things are affecting us over which we have no control. The price of our exports has driven Australia to the difficulties which we are now facing and which the Government is addressing, and we shall hear more about the Government's policies this evening.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Leader of the Opposition is on record as saying: `The times will suit me'. He is gleeful at the troubles that Australia is suffering. I tell him that the times will not suit him. He will have to put his policies on record in detail very soon. In fact, he will have to do so on Thursday night. The people will not put up with more vacillating on his part and mere rhetoric. The people will want details. I draw attention to a leading article in the Sydney Morning Herald of only a couple of days ago. It is headed `The Budget and Mr Howard'. The editorial asks how tough he is. It states:
       </para>
       <para>
        When Mr Keating unveils his . . . Budget, and the disadvantaged interest groups are squealing, Mr Howard must remind voters that his Budget would have been even tougher.
       </para>
       <para>
        He will have to get that on record. I opened my remarks today by talking about credibility, and there is not much credibility on the benches opposite. There is even less credibility now, and that will remain the position unless the Leader of the Opposition, in replying on Thursday night, gives details of what his so-called Budget would be.

         —The people of Australia who have listened to the psuedo Treasurer, the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (Mr Hurford), could be forgiven if they thought that the economy was in great shape, bearing in mind the diatribe that they would have heard. Everyone in Australia knows that the country is on its knees. The economy is in a mess and yet the Minister handed out to us the sort of stuff that we have just heard.

        In the short three years that the Government has been in office it already stands condemned on just about every issue that it has touched. For example, in ministeries as diverse as those dealing with foreign policy and Aboriginal affairs we have had the ridiculous MX missile decision and the absurd land rights decision. On social security, we have had the unjust asset-test pension decision. I could continue. In no area, however, has negligence been more prevalent than in that of economic policy. In the eyes of the Australian people the `world's greatest Treasurer' is now fighting to save his medal from rusting away. The chicken Hawke is seeing all his chickens come home to roost. The economic plug has been pulled and we have now moved into a downward vortex. We are running twenty-third out of twenty-four OECD countries in several of the major economic indicators. Let us go through some of those. Inflation in this country is running between 8 per cent and 9 per cent. At the same time, the inflation rate of our trading partners is running between 0 per cent and 2 per cent. I am thinking of countries such as West Germany, the United States of America and Japan. We are falling behind. We have virtually the highest interest rates in the world and the highest real interest rates in this country since the Great Depression. The Government has been trumpeting about the growth rate. It is slowing down, and that is because it was built on high spending and borrowed money. I could give any family of this nation $100,000 and it could live well while it was spending that sum. However, the day comes when money has to be paid back, and that is what is happening now.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government has trumpeted also about job creation; it has bragged about it. It is now turning round and we are moving into a period of spiralling unemployment, which will continue right through this year and next year. The Government's job creation has been based on borrowed money, the bulk of which has been spent in non-productive areas, such as jobs in the Public Service and in other shonky job creation schemes. In the Community Employment Program area alone, $1,100m has been spent. There have been things like Priority One. The deficit is just about the most devastating economic indicator of all. Let us look at the overseas debt. When this crew took over the overseas debt was running, in round figures, at about $25 billion gross. That was high enough, but what is it today? It has gone over $80 billion. It took 83 years since Federation to get to $25 billion. In three years it has more than trebled to over $80 billion, and next year it will go over $100 billion. In comparing this Government with the Whitlam Government, which everyone condemns, I think we should look at certain factors. The Whitlam Government was condemned, but at least it was open about the things it did. I think this Government is more devious and more cunning and it is getting away with things far worse.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let us look at how our dollar is going. It has dropped to around US60c, or 50c on the trade weighted index basket, and the Treasurer (Mr Keating), the world's greatest Treasurer, is using interest rates to prop it up. At the end of last year he went through the exercise of shoving interest rates up from about 14 per cent to 21 per cent, which nearly crippled every small business and farmer in this country, the wealth producers of this country. He finally saw the error of that method and he laid off that for a while. But what happened two or three weeks ago when the dollar started to plummet again? He rang up the Reserve Bank again and in a period of one week alone interest rates went up 3.4 per cent. He is back to his old tricks. All this will mean is that all available money will go into servicing interest rates and there will be none left over to spend elsewhere in the community.

        Let us look at the tax indicator. This Government has gone tax mad. In the last 12 months alone we have had tax after tax after tax introduced. The superannuation lump sum tax has been brought in. There has been an attempt to bring in a compulsory 3 per cent superannuation tax. The negative gearing measures have almost destroyed the rental industry. We have had the entertainment tax and the assets test tax on pensioners.

This Government seems to have a motto: If it moves, tax it; if it does not move, apply a death duty to it. Let us look at the fringe benefits tax. What does the Premier of Western Australia, Mr Burke, say about the fringe benefits tax? He is against it. What does Mr Bannon of South Australia say about the fringe benefits tax? He thinks it is ridiculous. What does Mr Cain of Victoria say about the fringe benefits tax? He thinks it is iniquitous. What does Mr Unsworth of New South Wales say about the tax? He thinks it is an administrative nightmare. What does Mr Warburton of Queensland think about the tax? He also thinks it is ridiculous. The fringe benefits tax, the latest in a long list of taxes, will only create three Ps in this country: Poverty, paper and public servants. The most stupid example surfaced just recently. Last night after midnight, at a quarter past twelve a doctor was called out to an urgent caesarian. But before he started his car to drive away he had to make eight entries in his log book.

They are putting them in the glove box and saying that at the end of the three month period they will fabricate the entries and fill in their log books. This is what this measure is doing; it is making cheats out of honest people because it is so ridiculous. As every Labor Premier in Australia has said, it is an administrative nightmare; it is absolute nonsense. The Government has completely lost its grip on reality. It has no concept of how to apply these taxes. It is killing people's initiative to work. It is abolishing the incentive of the people in this country to invest. It is rewarding failure and idleness.

        If one looks around the Government benches-there are not many Government members here today; only about three-one sees that they are awash with trendies and academics, most of whom have never done a day's work in the real world in their lives. They would not know what it was like to rake up the money at the end of the week to meet a pay cheque for their employees. They have never known what it is like to toss and turn at night wondering how one is going to make the next interest payment. If one has a look at the record of the man running the show, the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke), one sees that he has only come through the trade union movement and that when he led that all he did was introduce violence and aggression into it. He introduced disruption and vandalism to the country and I doubt that the country will ever get rid of it.

         —Exactly. When he headed the Australian Council of Trade Unions he tried to go into business. He tried to run Bourkes store. What happened to Bourkes store? It went broke. What happened to the ACTU-Solo petrol venture that he went into? It went broke. What happened to the ACTU Jetset Travel Service Pty Ltd, which he was trying to run? It went broke. Now he is trying to run Australia. What is happening to Australia: It is going broke too. The Treasurer and the Prime Minister are trying to bring down the economy of South Africa by putting on sanctions. If they want to bring down the economy of South Africa all they have to do is go over there and run the economy for a few months. Let us look at some of the work practices that grew out of the Prime Minister's ACTU and Australian Labor Party leadership. We need only go to today's paper to see the advertisement placed by Robe River Iron Associates. In the past three months to June 1986, $35m had already been lost through the ridiculous work practices there which this Government is backing up. Employees insist on driving water trucks even when it is raining because it is an easy job to do. It costs $80 to fill up a fire extinguisher if it is done after 5 o'clock in the afternoon. Because nine employees had only six litres of milk for their afternoon tea and they wanted a litre each they delayed the berthing of a ship which cost the customer and the company $42,000. So the story goes on. This epitomises what is wrong with this country. It is not going to improve until we have another election at which the Government will be defeated.

Honourable members opposite can consign the nation's great ills to the fact that people have to fill in a log book and that workers have afternoon tea, and think that if we got rid of the log books and afternoon tea, the place would be hunky-dory. Quite frankly, if at the next election people want to vote for that kind of substance-or lack of it, as has been so manifestly shown-good luck to this country.

         —Let me tell honourable members opposite something about Rockdale. The Liberal primary vote was down and if there was not a whole host of Independents stooging the public and doing their best to run a cover for the political party of those opposite, that sort of swing would not have occurred.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        What we are concerned with here today are the long term problems of the national economy which require long term solutions based on honesty, courage and the integrity of the interests of this nation, rather than the deceit, cynicism and failure to admit the mistakes of the past that characterises those opposite who have led this country into this predicament across 30 of the last 36 years. Today we have seen their perverted, distorted view of history and the way in which the nation's economy has panned out. Every national commentator who is respectable in the remotest sense agrees that this is a long term problem that requires long term solutions.
       </para>
       <para>
        The reality for those opposite, which they do not like to hear, is that for the vast majority of that time over which these problems have accrued they have been the people in government. To put a finer point on it, for five of the last seven years of conservative rule their present leader was the Treasurer of this nation, the man who had the opportunity to fix these long term problems but did not, and in fact went on to exacerbate them. It is those opposite and their political forefathers who created the economic and industrial structure of this economy that has left us as a nation vulnerable to the collapse in the price of our exports. Now, as usual, the Australian Labor Party-and we have been in office for a relatively short period-has to clean up the mess of those opposite. What are they doing in the meantime? They are busy playing politics, coming up with cliches, diversions from the national interest and destructive criticism.
       </para>
       <para>
        But worse still, as we have seen here today, they are proving to be most treacherous in their rhetoric. They are saying that this country cannot do it. They are saying that this country does not have the innate strength to come out of this predicament and to regain its place in the world. Those opposite take pride in belittling this country. They talk Australia down and, like that lightheaded Lightfoot from Western Australia, they are economic saboteurs of the first order. They seek to blame sections of the Australian population-the wage and salary earners-despite all the facts and all the statistics to the contrary. They seek to paint everybody who has ever had a social security benefit in his life as some sort of bludger and others as second-rate. Only they and their narrow-based constituency are reserved for anything but the worst.
       </para>
       <para>
        The truth of it is that history haunts the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) and his ramshackle team. I refer to Black Jack McEwen and his political marriage over 20 years ago of the rural big farm interests and the big city manufacturers-what Paul Kelly in a recent article in the Australian called `The incredible alliance'. The article contains some interesting quotes from what was written by Paul Kelly, one of Australia's most eminent journalists and, apart from myself, in all humility, one of the best at the Australian newspaper. He said:
       </para>
       <para>
        The McEwen legacy has hounded the Whitlam, Fraser and Hawke governments.
       </para>
       <para>
        He went on to say that Black Jack McEwen, the Opposition's political forefather, was the godfather of the banana republic. That, my friends opposite, is the sad truth. This country is in this predicament because of the policies of Opposition parties in the past; and, despite the 30 of the last 36 years, the Hawke Labor Government will bring this country out of those problems to a new era of prosperity.
       </para>
       <para>
        Let us have a look at the present Leader of the Opposition and what he has done. During his tenure as Treasurer, he actively brought about a worsening of this problem. In pursuit of the Fraser resources boom-a boom that never happened-the false pretensions created an even further over-valued exchange rate. Exporters and existing import-competing industries suffered intolerably and closed down by the dozen. This action exacerbated inflation. It caused a diversion of financial and entrepreneurial resources away from manufacturing in a process that was compounded by a warped tax system.
       </para>
       <para>
        The proof of this, if those opposite really want to measure their existing Leader, is in a very interesting quote from the November 1981 Stan Kelly memorial lecture by none other than John Stone, one of the Opposition's activists on the campaign trail. This quote, my friends, shows the deliberate approach by the honourable member for Bennelong to lead this nation, when he was Treasurer, further into international debt. This is what the servant of the former Treasurer, the current Leader of the Opposition, had to say:
       </para>
       <para>
        It is only the external option-that is, increasing the current account deficit on the balance of payments-which increases the totality of resources available to the community and thereby gives an immediate increase in growth potential.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is what was said by John Stone in November 1981. It is on record that there was a deliberate policy by the Howard-Fraser Government to plunge this country further into international debt. It is on the public record. It was a deliberate policy, and it was one that served only to exacerbate the damage caused by their political forefathers in their early years.
       </para>
       <para>
        Yet despite that, they come in here this afternoon with this matter of public importance to blame this Government and to try to make political capital. Let me say this here and now: It is not our credibility but the Opposition's credibility that is on the line. The Australian public will remember the current Leader of the Opposition as the Treasurer of those dark years and they will know-if they do not know now, we shall make sure that they do by the next election-what the alternative really means.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the few remaining minutes that I have, let me dispel a couple of myths. I have some interesting figures. In 1980-81, Australia's current account deficit leapt from 1.7 per cent to 4.1 per cent of gross domestic product. In 1981-82, it leapt further to 6 per cent of GDP, which illustrates how suddenly and dramatically the current Leader of the Opposition, when he was Treasurer, put this country on the road to international indebtedness. The interesting point is that this Government has actually lowered the current account deficit as a proportion of gross domestic product compared with what it was when the honourable member for Bennelong was Treasurer-that is, in terms of gross domestic product, this Government has started to turn back the rot that the honourable member for Bennelong put into place.
       </para>
       <para>
        Another cliche put around the community by those opposite is that this foreign debt is somehow government-induced debt. This is not so. Of the $75 billion, only $15 billion is directly related to the Government; $60 billion of the foreign debt comes from the private sector. The other interesting point is this simple fact: If the prices of our commodities had not fallen in the manner in which they have-that is, if the terms of trade had not collapsed as they have-this country would be $6.5 billion better off and not only would there be no balance of payments crisis, as those opposite like to call it, but also there would not be a problem at all.
       </para>
       <para>
        The fact of the matter is that the world has cut our income by 3 per cent. This Government will not shirk from the hard task of bringing this country back to where it should be. But let us have no more of the hypocrisy from those opposite who for 30 of the past 36 years have run the country into the ground.

      <para>
       The tariff proposals I have just tabled relate to proposed alterations to the Excise Tariff Act 1921 and the Customs Tariff Act 1982. The Proposals formally place before Parliament, as required by law, tariff alterations made by notices published in the Gazette during the recent recess.
      </para>
      <para>
       Excise Tariff Proposals Nos. 5, 6 and 7 (1986), operative on and from 14 June, 26 July and 16 August respectively, provide for altered rates of excise duty on certain refined petroleum products resulting from the government's decisions on the pricing of indigenous crude oil and related issues. Customs Tariff Proposals Nos. 7, 11 and 13 (1986), operative on and from 14 June, 18 July and 16 August 1986 respectively, provide for corresponding alterations of rates of Customs duty. While rates of diesel fuel rebate alter in conjunction with these duty changes, the rebate rate for eligible primary production has been maintained as a 100 per cent rebate of the duty. The rebate rate changes for eligible mining operations also effectively mean no increase in duty payable.
      </para>
      <para>
       Excise Tariff Proposals No. 8 (1986), operative on and from 1 August 1986, reduce the top marginal rate of excise on old oil produced offshore from 87 per cent to 80 per cent. This concession, announced by the Government on 28 July 1986, will remain in force for the remainder of 1986-87. However, should the Bass Strait import parity price recover to $20 per barrel before the end of the financial year this arrangement will be reviewed.
      </para>
      <para>
       Customs Tariff Proposals No. 8 (1986), operative on and from 15 April 1986, implement changes to remove the 2 per cent revenue duty on certain agricultural chemicals falling within item 38.11 in Schedule 3 to the Customs Tariff Act 1982. This action has been taken to implement part of the Government's economic and rural policy statement announced by my colleague the Minister for Primary Industry (Mr Kerin) and permits the duty-free entry of these chemicals.
      </para>
      <para>
       Customs Tariff Proposals Nos. 9 and 12 (1986) provide for the duty-free entry of certain goods of New Zealand origin. Custom Tariff Proposals No. 9 (1986), operative on and from 1 May 1986, remove the 5 per cent duty previously applicable on certain powered lawnmowers. This action follows a further review under the intermediate goods provisions of the Australia New Zealand closer economic relations trade agreement.
      </para>
      <para>
       Customs Tariff Proposals No. 12 (1986) remove the 4 per cent duty which had applied to certain furniture and parts of New Zealand origin. As a result of representations by the Australian and New Zealand furniture industries to their respective governments, agreement has been reached to bring forward by 12 months the removal of trade restrictions on these goods. The relevant changes are therefore operative on and from 1 July 1986.
      </para>
      <para>
       The two changes contained in Customs Tariff Proposals No. 10 (1986) are operative on and from 1 July 1986. The first change removes the 2 per cent revenue duty on sulphur falling within item 25.03 in Schedule 3 to the Customs Tariff Act 1982. This change forms part of the Government's decision on the report of the Government study group on fertiliser production and consumption in Australia and the Industries Assistance Commission's Report on Fertilisers.
      </para>
      <para>
       The other amendment provides for the continuity of the Government's decision on the Industries Assistance Commission's report on electric motors and generating sets. This decision was originally implemented by Customs Tariff Proposals No. 5 (1986), operative on and from 18 April 1986, but some restructuring of the Customs Tariff Act was required on 1 July 1986 because of the introduction of the revised system of tariff preferences for developing countries on that date. The rates originally implemented by Customs Tariff Proposals No. 5 (1986) are not altered in any way by the current proposals. Summaries of alterations contained in these proposals have been prepared and are being circulated for the information of honourable members. I commend the proposals to the House.

       <para>
        This Bill gives effect to several Government decisions relating to the remuneration of parliamentarians, judges and certain other public office holders. The prime purpose is to put into effect the Government's decision not to accept the Remuneration Tribunal's recommendation of an 11.7 per cent increase in parliamentary salaries. In presenting its 1986 review, the Tribunal stated that since 1 July 1984 the salary level of senators and members has been some 11.7 per cent less than ordinarily it should have been. The anomaly arose in the context of the 1984 review when the Tribunal established an equitable base for other groups in its jurisdiction by granting an 11.7 per cent increase, but this increase was not given to members by the Tribunal because of submissions by the Government and other parties. The same situation occurred in 1985 when the Tribunal drew attention to the anomaly but did not act in view of submissions by the Government and the Opposition parties.
       </para>
       <para>
        In 1986 the Tribunal noted similar submissions from the Government and the parties, but determined an 11.7 per cent increase on the basis of what the Tribunal saw as compliance with its statutory obligation and fairness and equity. The Government announced, on 1 July, its intention not to accept the increase. While we recognise that parliamentary salaries are subject to a considerable anomaly and that in some cases this may be placing some strain on the resources of individual members, we have agreed that parliamentarians must, in the current economic climate, forgo any recommended increase in salary above national wage case increases.
       </para>
       <para>
        This Act therefore amends Tribunal determinations 7 and 8, relating to additional salary for parliamentary office holders and basic salary of senators and members, so that existing salaries are increased only by the outcome of the recent national wage case. The basic salary of a member will then be $45,543; had the Tribunal's determination remained in force it would have been $50,871. As Remuneration Tribunal determinations come into effect on the date specified by the Tribunal, which in this case was 1 July 1986, the Act also allows for the alteration to the determinations to be effected retrospectively. The increased salary which has been paid to members since 1 July will therefore be required to be repaid and appropriate arrangements will be put in place. Because ministerial salaries are fixed by Government decision, Ministers have not received any payment by way of the anomaly element. The Bill also withdraws any entitlement to an 11.7 per cent increase in parliamentary superannuation benefits.
       </para>
       <para>
        Part III of the Bill amends the Judicial and Statutory Officers (Remuneration and Allowances) Act to give effect to Tribunal recommendations regarding the salary and allowances of judges and members of the Interstate Commission. It provides for salaries to be increased by national wage case decisions only; allowances are to be adjusted in line with cost of living increases. The opportunity has been taken in Part IV of the Bill to alter the mechanism for increasing the annual appropriation for ministerial salaries under the Ministers of State Act so as to avoid continual alterations to the Act. To remove the need for recurrent legislative amendment, it is proposed to amend the Ministers of State Act to provide that in future the limit should be fixed by regulation under the Act. The limit will continue to be set on the basis of the actual salaries payable to Ministers as decided by the Government following recommendations of the Remuneration Tribunal. The regulations will of course be subject to the same parliamentary scrutiny and the same disallowance provisions as other regulations. I commend the Bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum to the Bill.

         —The reasons for the Remuneration and Allowances Alteration Bill 1986 have been outlined by the Special Minister of State (Mr Young), save for one which is the most important of the reasons. It is because of the parlous economic circumstances in which this country finds itself that this Bill is being put up by this Government. Those economic circumstances are directly due to a matchless combination of arrogance, incompetence and recklessness that this Government has exhibited in its economic policy planning, if one could call what this Government has done for some time policy planning.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para>
        The Special Minister of State has pointed out that there are anomalies. I agree that there are anomalies. Outside this House he has pointed to the need to pay parliamentarians a proper salary. I agree with those views but I also agree with the views that he has expressed on behalf of the Government to the effect that now is not the time for any anomalies to be dealt with. It is for members of parliament to present an example to people when it comes to restraint in these harsh economic times.
       </para>
       <para>
        As the honourable member for Denison says, it never is a time to catch up. He is in fact right. It is worth while recalling that in 1975 a Level 2 public servant was paid, I think, $20,000 and a member of parliament was also paid $20,000. In 1986 a Level 2 public servant is paid, I believe, $53,632 and a member of parliament is paid $45,543. The salary of a public servant has gone up by 168 per cent and the salary of a member of parliament has gone up by 127 per cent, which says something as to who runs things in this country.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is necessary to exercise restraint and, save for one qualification, we have no opposition to the Bill. The qualification relates to the provision in the Bill that provides that ministerial salaries be increased by regulation and not by amendment as required under the Members of State Act 1952. We oppose that provision and ordinarily we would have voted against it but in the circumstances, Budget day, we do not propose to call a division on it. We do not think it is appropriate that that kind of a matter be dealt with by regulation and we think it is better that the old procedure, even if it is somewhat cumbersome, be pursued so that a closer public scrutiny can be given to increases in ministerial salaries.

         —I do not intend to speak at any length on the Remuneration and Allowances Alteration Bill save to say that it is often suggested that members of parliament should set an example to other members of the community in relation to the way in which they are remunerated. That is often said against a background which people fail to readily understand and appreciate, that over the last 12 years a very considerable example has been set to the community as a whole and I think in many respects has not been appreciated nor understood.

        I have had prepared from time to time, and most recently in May of this year, a table which sets out to compare the parliamentary salary as fixed in 1974 after a most thoroughgoing review by the Remuneration Tribunal, its most substantial review and second only to the report of His Honour, Mr Justice Kerr, of December 1971 for the thoroughness with which the matter of remuneration of members of parliament generally was examined. At that date a salary of $20,000 was fixed as the appropriate emolument for members of parliament. Since that time-that is until the most recent increase-the amount fixed in percentage terms was 122.6 per cent above that paid in 1974. Comparatively, for average weekly earnings the amount of increase was 246.9 per cent. The increase in the consumer price index was 206.5 per cent.
       </para>
       <para>
        The honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Spender) when speaking on this matter mentioned the increases that occurred in relation to the Australian Public Service. It was the least advantageous group with which to make the comparison. If one made this comparison with journalists, a D grade journalist had received over the same time a 198.8 per cent increase. If this comparison was taken with some of the newspapers of this country and looked at in terms of earnings per share, the percentage increase for News Corporation Ltd was 1,420 per cent. If one takes this in relation to the most needy people in the community the comparisons are similarly very marked, with increases generally well in excess of 200 per cent; in relation to doctors and medical practitioners, 231 per cent; and in relation to academics largely in excess of 200 per cent. I think that is a table that ought to be more widely distributed and understood. For that reason, I seek permission to have the table incorporated in Hansard.

         —in reply-I would like to thank those honourable members who have taken part in the debate. I think that most of what has been said is well known by honourable members. I do not think that the earlier remarks of the honourable member for North Sydney (Mr Spender) were quite accurate when he said that the decision is reflective of the state of the economy. I remind him that his former Prime Minister before he was a member of the House made similar decisions to this on about four occasions during his seven years of office. So it is not an unusual step to be taken by a government; it just seems to be one of our fates.

        —I thank the House for its courtesy. Following the tabling of the report of the Auditor General in April 1985-honourable members will be aware that each year the Committee examines recently published reports of the Auditor-General-the Committee sought written submissions from 10 departments and five statutory authorities in respect of 22 items. Further information and clarification by way of supplementary submissions were sought from six departments and one statutory authority. Report 248 is a departure from the usual practice of the Committee. Due to an increasing work load the Committee decided that the Parliament's attention should be drawn to the salient features of the Auditor-General's report in future. Consequently the principal matters on which the Committee sought comment from departments and authorities were addressed but public hearings were not held on any of the matters raised on this occasion.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       This report comments on the responses of the departments and authorities to criticisms raised by the Auditor-General. Conclusions drawn by the Committee reflect remedial action taken or proposed to be taken in addressing those items. In particular there were three matters that the Committee wished to bring to the attention of members of Parliament. The first was the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations wage pause program; the second, the Department of Territories administration of the Commissioner for Housing loans scheme and, third, the financial statements of the Australian National University. The Special Employment-related Programs Act 1982 provided for the expenditure of up to $200m through a wage pause program of public sector job creation. The money partly represented expected savings from the 12 months suspension of salary increases for Commonwealth employees under the salaries and wages pause legislation. Under the established guidelines the States were required to submit employment projects to the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations and if considered suitable details were forwarded to the Minister for Finance (Senator Walsh) for approval. Projects which were to receive consideration for approval were required to be labour intensive and to promote greater equality of opportunity particularly for the long term unemployed.
      </para>
      <para>
       The audit review of the scheme sought to establish whether the procedures introduced to administer the program within the area of Commonwealth responsibilities were consistent with the aims and objectives. The Committee was disturbed by the administrative difficulties which developed following hasty implementation of the wage pause program, and in particular from the inadequacy of interdepartmental co-ordination. In view of this concern and the fact that this program ceased in mid-1984, the Committee sought supplementary submissions from both the Employment and Industrial Relations Department and the Finance Department with respect to another similar employment program. The House will be familiar with that program, the community employment program.
      </para>
      <para>
       While this program is not subject to audit, the Committee considered it important to assess the administrative arrangement governing it. From the respective departmental submissions, it is clear that the administrative and financial arrangements for the community employment program differ quite markedly from those which applied to the wage pause program. The Minister for Finance has limited executive responsibilities and the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations clearly has carriage of the legislation and program administration. Clearer working guidelines and funding through annual appropriations have, to a large degree, clarified the obligations and responsibilities of the agencies concerned.
      </para>
      <para>
       The second matter was the housing loans scheme operational in the Australian Capital Territory. Under the Housing Ordinance 1982 the Commissioner for Housing in May, subject to the control of the Minister for Territories, administers schemes for providing or assisting in providing dwellings in the Australian Capital Territory. On 10 September 1984 the Minister for Finance, pursuant to concern expressed by Cabinet about the management of funds in the scheme, requested the Auditor-General to perform an audit of the recent operations of the scheme in the light of recent over-commitment of funds. Audit findings were that, first, the housing trust account was overexpended from 4 July 1984 to 18 July 1984 in breach of section 34 of the Audit Act, secondly, that there were deficiencies in the administration for controlling equipment; and, thirdly, that the estimated shortfall of $7.9m in funds was an unreliable estimate. The Committee was informed that the Department has now instituted amended procedures and practices in order to eliminate any future problems with over-commitment of funds. Further, the Department has implemented a range of measures to improve the financial and administrative procedures and staffing arrangements of the Housing Branch. These amended procedures and arrangements implement many of the recommendations of a joint review of the scheme by the Public Service Board and the Department of Territories, conducted during September 1984, and of the Fisher Review conducted during the first half of 1985.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Steering Committee for Housing Loans is continuing to meet on a regular basis to implement the longer term recommendations of the joint review report and will continue to do so until all recommendations are satisfactorily implemented. The Committee notes that Audits comments on these amended schemes and procedures should eliminate future problems. However, I want to emphasise, as I particularly have this view, that the Committee will continue to monitor the Department's operation of the scheme and may subject it to further review in the light of future comments and the Committee's own consideration of more detailed information to be made available to it by the Department.

       The Auditor-General also reported on an inspection of the accounts and records of financial transactions of the Australian National University for the year ended 31 December 1983. Among other things audit noted serious deficiencies existed in supporting documentation for the university's 1983 draft financial statements, both in their original form and in the revised draft submitted some months later. Audit was concerned that in some respects the university's accounting practices were at variance with those prescribed in the guidelines on the form and standard of financial statements of Commonwealth undertakings issued by the Minister for Finance in May 1983. The Committee notes that the University has significantly reformed its financial administration and that this reform process is continuing. The Committee anticipates continued improvement in the University's financial administration, particularly with reference to its financial statements. The Auditor-General now reports twice each year on audits undertaken. In addition separate reports are made throughout the year on efficiency audits performed by the Auditor-General, and annual reports on the financial statements and his activities.
      </para>
      <para>
       During the currency of the examination of the Auditor-General's report of April 1985 the Auditor-General presented an annual report for 1984-85 on his operations. This was the first time the Auditor-General had reported in this manner. The report referred to, amongst other things, a number of issues concerning the role and proper function of the Auditor-General, particularly his relationship with the Executive. The Joint Parliamentary Committee of Public Accounts looks forward to discussions with the Auditor-General on these matters. I commend this report to honourable members.

        —by leave-The report which has just been tabled by the honourable member for Dundas (Mr Ruddock) is a most important report because the Joint Standing Committee of Public Accounts is a watch-dog of the Parliament and a watchdog of the public purse. As a member of parliament who is not a member of that Committee I want to make a brief comment in relation to one aspect of the report, and that is the first part of the three investigations referred to by the honourable member for Dundas relating to the manner in which $200m had been dispersed. Those funds came about as a result of the wage pause legislation of 1982 which, it should be remembered, was brought into this Parliament by the Fraser Government. It is important to note that it was as a result of that legislation that some $200m became available to this Government, the Hawke socialist Government, which was then supposed to do something about getting young people into the work force. I see that honourable members on the Government benches are finding some amusement in this. I do not think that $200m being put aside to help young people into employment, particularly those who have been unemployed for lengthy periods, as the honourable member for Dundas pointed out, is a laughing matter. I think it is a very sad thing that the report has revealed--

        —It is all right for you, grave robber, to turn this debate-about which I am trying to make just a short comment-on your Government's failure to deliver $200m worth of efficient employment opportunities to the young people of Australia into a laughing matter. The young people have had the Government. It promised that it would get them jobs but in fact the level of youth unemployment today is higher than it was when Mr Fraser was Prime Minister. It cannot be laughed off either by the Minister for Social Security (Mr Howe) or anybody else when the report contains comments such as `hasty implementation', `inadequacy of preparation' and `non-compliance with guidelines'. This is not a laughing matter. We are talking about $200m provided as a result of a Fraser Government initiative which should have gone towards providing worth-while and permanent employment to young people in this country, and sadly it has not.

I would like to take this discussion further but I shall not abuse the indulgence that the House has granted. I simply say this: When this Committee reports to the Parliament that $200m of taxpayers' money, which was deliberately set aside to provide work for the young people of this country, has not been used to the best advantage, sadly this is yet another example of the utter financial incompetence, negligence and recklessness of the Hawke socialist Government, which is now on its last legs and, by divine providence, will be out of office at the next election.

        It is imperative that our domestic economy and our standard of living adjust to our changed trading circumstances so that we can make an early return to higher growth and stronger employment.
       </para>
       <para>
        What precisely are the adjustments required?
       </para>
       <para>
        As a nation, if we are to become more independent and self-sufficient, we need to invest more and consume less.
       </para>
       <para>
        In other words, we must save for the future rather than spend for the present.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government can help this process directly by spending less and borrowing less, thereby improving the climate for lower interest rates and for private sector investment.
       </para>
       <para>
        The savings and tax decisions in this Budget are also designed to restrain the growth of private consumption.
       </para>
       <para>
        But the Budget alone cannot achieve all of the changes Australia requires.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is also essential that Australians exercise restraint over wages and prices.
       </para>
       <para>
        We simply cannot allow the inevitable inflationary effects of the dollar's fall to feed into our cost structure.
       </para>
       <para>
        Contrary to the beliefs of some, Australia is well equipped to make the adjustments to rectify its problems.
       </para>
       <para>
        We have made enormous progress in the past 3 years in modernising and freeing up the economy.
       </para>
       <para>
        We have a much lower wage cost structure, a vibrant financial sector, and vastly more competitive industries than a few years ago.
       </para>
       <para>
        While we have now encountered serious difficulties in our primary export markets, through our combined efforts and continued restraint we can turn those efforts towards new opportunities.
       </para>
       <para>
        For these reasons, the Budget incorporates a very large cut in spending and a very large cut in Government borrowing.
       </para>
       <para>
        In making these vital decisions we have sought to ensure that the burden of change is spread as fairly as possible across the community.
       </para>
       <para>
        Even in difficulty, however, we have maintained the Labor Party's traditional commitment to the most needy.
       </para>
       <para>
        But we have not shirked our responsibility to take hard decisions where these have been required.
       </para>
       <para>
        Reflecting this, the Government has been able to bring the deficit down from $5,726 million last year to $3,503 million this year.
       </para>
       <para>
        I repeat, this Budget cuts the deficit by $2,223 million to $3,503 million.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is also important to understand that while in total the Commonwealth has budgeted for a deficit of $3.5 billion, much of this deficit arises from spending abroad on defence equipment and other items.
       </para>
       <para>
        Allowing for these overseas transactions there will be an estimated domestic budget surplus of $805 million.
       </para>
       <para>
        Combined with reductions in State borrowings, the large cut in the Budget deficit will dramatically lower government demand for borrowed funds.
       </para>
       <para>
        In fact, total public sector borrowings will be cut by more than $2 1/2 billion in 1986-87.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government's bond selling program has been cut from $5.7 billion last year to around $3 billion this year.
       </para>
       <para>
        As a result, the net bond selling task will be zero.
       </para>
       <para>
        I would point out that the large reduction in the deficit this year has been made notwithstanding economic developments tending to increase it.
       </para>
       <para>
        Wage restraint tends to lower taxes more than outlays in the short term.
       </para>
       <para>
        As I shall discuss later, the Budget figuring incorporates a 2 per cent discount to wages in the next National Wage Case.
       </para>
       <para>
        Without that assumption, the deficit would have been some $400 million less.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government's resolve and achievement in this Budget is well reflected in the fact that if we had taken no action on outlays or receipts the deficit would have been $7.5 billion.
       </para>
       <para>
        We have brought it down by $4 billion, or more than half.
       </para>
       <para>
        THE BUDGET MEASURES
       </para>
       <para>
        Madam Speaker, the deficit reduction in this Budget has been accomplished by an examination of outlays of unprecedented rigour.
       </para>
       <para>
        If we had done no more than provide for ongoing programs, outlays would have increased by 2.7 per cent in real terms.
       </para>
       <para>
        We have cut this back to zero real growth.
       </para>
       <para>
        To achieve this result, nearly $3 billion has been cut from existing programs.
       </para>
       <para>
        Cutbacks have been made in most areas, with major reductions falling on social security, health, education, defence and overseas aid.
       </para>
       <para>
        In social security, the Government has decided on cutbacks of over $500 million.
       </para>
       <para>
        Included in those decisions, future six monthly indexation increases to beneficiaries will continue to be paid in full but will be deferred for six weeks.
       </para>
       <para>
        This means that the 4 per cent increase due in early November will now be paid in mid-December.
       </para>
       <para>
        In addition, the measures announced last year to relax income testing arrangements for pensions and benefits will be delayed 8 months until July 1987.
       </para>
       <para>
        These are the only changes to the general pension and benefits area.
       </para>
       <para>
        While seeking a contribution from this part of the Budget towards the resolution of our national problems, the Government has ensured that there will be no reductions in any existing pension or benefit payments.
       </para>
       <para>
        What is being required is a minimal sacrifice when compared with that being asked of wage and salary earners.
       </para>
       <para>
        There will be a crackdown on cheating and fraud in the social security system.
       </para>
       <para>
        We will not compromise our deep commitment to assist the genuinely needy.
       </para>
       <para>
        But abuse of the system will not be tolerated.
       </para>
       <para>
        Special reviews will be conducted by teams of officers to identify and disqualify those wrongfully receiving unemployment benefits.
       </para>
       <para>
        Additionally, reporting requirements for all unemployment beneficiaries will be tightened and it will be much harder for New Zealand citizens who are visiting Australia to qualify for unemployment and other benefits.
       </para>
       <para>
        There will also be reviews of sole parent beneficiaries to verify continuing eligibility.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government is committed to implementing the Australia Card with a photograph, which will also assist in combatting social security fraud.
       </para>
       <para>
        Child maintenance arrangements are being reformed so that non-custodial parents will shoulder more financial responsibility for their children, rather than throwing the burden onto the taxpayer.
       </para>
       <para>
        In line with the Government's aim to target welfare assistance to the most needy, the family allowance for student children aged 16 and 17 will be income tested so that families with household income exceeding $39,000 will no longer receive it.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the same vein, the Government will in this Budget provide further assistance to the most needy, low income families with children and to the handicapped.
       </para>
       <para>
        These discretionary adjustments are detailed in the Budget Papers.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government has taken a range of measures to help contain the growing cost of Australia's health system.
       </para>
       <para>
        Spending in this area will be cut by $300 million.
       </para>
       <para>
        First, strict measures have been adopted to reduce what were clearly excessive pathology charges by some medical practitioners.
       </para>
       <para>
        Second, the wage restraint asked of the workforce at large has been extended to medical practitioners by deferring increases in schedule fees until 1 November 1986.
       </para>
       <para>
        Third, the maximum patient contribution for medical services-I stress the maximum, not the typical-is to be raised from $10 to $20 from 1 November.
       </para>
       <para>
        Fourth, the bed day subsidy to private hospitals will cease from 1 October 1986, but some charitable hospitals will continue to receive assistance.
       </para>
       <para>
        But even with these savings, and particularly with the recent increases in salaries for nurses, the cost of the health system is continuing to rise.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government therefore believes that the Medicare levy should be increased so that it makes a greater contribution to health costs and so that Medicare is self-financing.
       </para>
       <para>
        Accordingly, the Medicare levy will rise by a quarter of a per cent to 1.25 per cent from 1 December.
       </para>
       <para>
        Increasing the levy is a more equitable means of responding to unavoidable increases in health costs than the alternative of severely curtailing Medicare benefits.
       </para>
       <para>
        Pharmaceutical benefits have been another area of burgeoning costs in the health system.
       </para>
       <para>
        This has been a concern to both the Government and the very sick.
       </para>
       <para>
        New arrangements will reduce costs to the health system and provide relief to those most in need.
       </para>
       <para>
        From 1 November prescription drug users now paying a $5 contribution will pay up to a $10 maximum.
       </para>
       <para>
        New safety net arrangements mean individuals and families requiring more than 25 prescriptions a year will receive prescriptions beyond that number free of charge.
       </para>
       <para>
        Pensioners will continue to receive items on the Pharmaceutical Benefits list free of any charge.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government believes it is only fair that participants in the higher education system share some part of its costs.
       </para>
       <para>
        Consequently a charge of $250 per year for all higher education students will be introduced in 1987 to offset administration costs.
       </para>
       <para>
        This charge represents only a small part of the cost of providing higher education, and will contribute towards an additional student intake of 3000 in 1987.
       </para>
       <para>
        Lower income families will be protected; holders of tertiary allowances and post-graduate awards and overseas students paying the overseas student charge will not be affected.
       </para>
       <para>
        Spending on defence is to be held at 1 per cent real growth, saving $190 million, and overseas aid will be cut by $140 million from its forward estimate.
       </para>
       <para>
        Expenditure on the new Parliament House is to be reduced by $30 million, sports facilities by $8 million and the Bicentennial Program by $25 million.
       </para>
       <para>
        The number of Commonwealth public servants will be reduced by 2000 over the year to June 1987.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government has made numerous other expenditure cuts in reaching its $3 billion expenditure savings; details are set out in the Budget Papers.
       </para>
       <para>
        Madam Speaker, the overwhelming concern of the Government in bringing down this Budget has been to achieve an outcome appropriate for a nation with a trading problem of the magnitude now facing Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is why spending has been held to zero real increase.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is why we have sought to produce the lowest practicable budget deficit.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government has held outlays and the deficit well below the trilogy requirements.
       </para>
       <para>
        Outlays as a proportion of gross domestic product have been reduced to 29.4 per cent, compared with 30.1 per cent last year and 30.4 per cent the year before.
       </para>
       <para>
        The deficit has been reduced to only 1.4 per cent of gross domestic product, back to the average prevailing during the late 1950s and the 1960s.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is the fourth consecutive fall from the 5 per cent in prospect that we inherited from the Coalition Government in 1983.
       </para>
       <para>
        In pursuit of this objective and given the urgency of our predicament the Government has decided to lift the tax ratio about half a per cent above the 1984-85 level.
       </para>
       <para>
        This decision has been taken to achieve an even larger reduction in the deficit, and to do so in an equitable way.
       </para>
       <para>
        Our trilogy of fiscal commitments was directed at restraining the size of Government over the medium-term and we reaffirm that fundamental objective.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government has been spectacularly successful in lowering expenditure growth and the deficit.
       </para>
       <para>
        Moreover, it is our objective to bring the tax ratio back to 25 per cent of gross domestic product next year.
       </para>
       <para>
        This year, however, the first stage of the very substantial cuts in personal income tax provided by the tax reform program will be delayed three months.
       </para>
       <para>
        These cuts-at the previously announced rates-will now apply from 1 December this year.
       </para>
       <para>
        The second and final stage-reducing the top marginal tax rates to 49 cents and 40 cents-will apply from 1 July 1987 as scheduled.
       </para>
       <para>
        Legislation implementing both stages is being introduced tonight.
       </para>
       <para>
        These cuts-as well as improving incentive-will return to taxpayers about three times the revenue raised by the tax reform package.
       </para>
       <para>
        Madam Speaker, the Government has adopted a number of other revenue measures.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the main, the measures will restrain real household disposable incomes and consumption, consistent with the need for our living standards to be trimmed for a time.
       </para>
       <para>
        Wholesale sales tax will be increased on a range of consumer products including luxury motor vehicles, wine, certain non-alcoholic beverages and swimming pools.
       </para>
       <para>
        The sales tax law is also to be amended with effect from midnight tonight to curtail avoidance of taxes on computer software.
       </para>
       <para>
        The excise on petrol and diesel fuel will increase by 3 cents per litre from tonight.
       </para>
       <para>
        Because of the existing diesel rebate arrangements, this additional excise will not fall upon farmers and miners.
       </para>
       <para>
        The rates of the Bank Account Debits Tax will be increased by up to a half from 1 December 1986.
       </para>
       <para>
        The tax deferral advantages enjoyed by some companies with substituted accounting periods will be phased out over three years.
       </para>
       <para>
        PRICES AND INCOMES POLICY
       </para>
       <para>
        Madam Speaker, the Budget I have outlined tonight will greatly assist Australia to adapt to the new international trading circumstances we face.
       </para>
       <para>
        However, budget policy must be supported by continued price and wage moderation.
       </para>
       <para>
        The restructuring of Australian industry facilitated by the depreciation of the dollar will accelerate provided we stay competitive with the rest of the world.
       </para>
       <para>
        Staying competitive means having a greater ability to supply our own market with Australian-made goods and to win a larger share of world markets.
       </para>
       <para>
        Over the past 3 years Australia's working men and women have shown commendable income restraint.
       </para>
       <para>
        More than any other single factor, their co-operation and good sense has been responsible for the creation of 630,000 jobs since April 1983.
       </para>
       <para>
        Over this period real labour costs have fallen by more than 7 per cent.
       </para>
       <para>
        It is not the fault of wage and salary earners that export prices have fallen.
       </para>
       <para>
        Just as it is not their fault that the dollar has fallen, pushing up import prices.
       </para>
       <para>
        But we cannot afford to let wages grow automatically in line with this price surge.
       </para>
       <para>
        If adverse trading conditions and a depreciating Australian dollar are the cause of the Consumer Price Index rising, it follows that to allow those increases to flow through automatically into wages would compound our problems.
       </para>
       <para>
        We would be adjusting our wages upwards not to compensate for the problem but to build the problem in.
       </para>
       <para>
        This would only lead Australia into a price and wage spiral.
       </para>
       <para>
        I am certain that all Australians will understand and accept that we cannot have our national income slashed by over $6 billion and at the same time seek to fully maintain our wages in real terms.
       </para>
       <para>
        Accordingly, at the next National Wage Case when the combined 4.0 per cent movement in the March and June quarter Consumer Price Index will be considered, the Government will argue to the Arbitration Commission that the proposed increase in wages be cut by 2 per cent.
       </para>
       <para>
        This means that wages will rise by 2 per cent less than the increase which would fully compensate for inflation.
       </para>
       <para>
        There are good and clear reasons for this.
       </para>
       <para>
        Last year award wages grew by 4 1/2 per cent.
       </para>
       <para>
        With a 2 per cent discount, wages are expected to grow at about the same moderate rates as in 1985-86.
       </para>
       <para>
        This means that over the course of the next year Australian wage increases will be broadly comparable with our major trading partners.
       </para>
       <para>
        A 2 per cent discount would therefore maintain our competitiveness and preserve our ability to compete on favourable terms with the rest of the world.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government will also seek a further adjustment of the wage increase in the case commencing around April next year if economic conditions applying at the time warrant it.
       </para>
       <para>
        In determining its attitude to that case, the Government's main focus will continue to be on Australia's ongoing competitive position and our terms of trade performance.
       </para>
       <para>
        With its past record of success, the Government reaffirms its confidence in the Prices and Incomes Accord.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Accord framework will continue to deliver more economically and industrially responsible outcomes than any other real world alternative.
       </para>
       <para>
        The challenges now presented by severely depressed commodity prices demand a continuation of this approach.
       </para>
       <para>
        ECONOMIC OUTLOOK
       </para>
       <para>
        Madam Speaker, it will take some time for the ground lost in our export markets to be recovered, and a stronger growth path to be resumed.
       </para>
       <para>
        As a result, we expect growth in the non-farm economy to be around 2 1/2 per cent in 1986-87 compared with 4 per cent last financial year.
       </para>
       <para>
        Most of that growth will stem from our improved international competitiveness; it will show up in the winning of new export markets and the replacement of imports with locally produced goods.
       </para>
       <para>
        However, the lower growth rate means that fewer jobs will be created over the next year than in the last twelve months.
       </para>
       <para>
        Employment growth is expected to slow to between 1 1/2 and 2 per cent, and as a consequence, unemployment could rise a little.
       </para>
       <para>
        Just as it will take some time for the benefits of the depreciation of the dollar to flow through the economy, it will also take some time before the adverse price effects of the depreciation are behind us.
       </para>
       <para>
        Consequently, reflecting the recent falls in the dollar, we expect the Consumer Price Index to increase by around 8 per cent on average in 1986-87.
       </para>
       <para>
        However, the trend in the latter part of the year and beyond will be downward.
       </para>
       <para>
        Madam Speaker, the Budget I am presenting tonight responds decisively to the new international challenge facing Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        It constitutes one of the basic and fundamental responses required to permanently improve Australia's trading performance.
       </para>
       <para>
        It makes the major shift down in Government spending and borrowing that will permit the new investment opportunities to be seized:
       </para>
       <para>
        - real spending growth has been cut to zero;
       </para>
       <para>
        - the deficit has been dramatically brought back to its late 1950s and 60s levels;
       </para>
       <para>
        and
       </para>
       <para>
        - Government calls on the nation's savings have been substantially alleviated.
       </para>
       <para>
        This Budget provides Australia with the opportunity to surmount its economic problems and maintain control over its economic destiny.
       </para>
       <para>
        It demonstrates the Government's absolute determination to do what has to be done to safeguard Australia's economic future.
       </para>
       <para>
        It demonstrates once again that, by resolute action and by some sacrifice all round, there is no problem that we cannot face and defeat together.

        OUTLAYS
       </para>
       <para>
        Madam Speaker, I now provide more details of the expenditure cuts that have been made.
       </para>
       <para>
        Budget outlays in 1986-87 are estimated to total $74,764 million.
       </para>
       <para>
        As I stated earlier, this represents zero growth in real terms.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the previous thirty years lower real rates of growth have been achieved on only three occasions.
       </para>
       <para>
        This outcome reflects the determined approach which the Government has adopted to expenditure control.
       </para>
       <para>
        Details of individual decisions are contained in the Measures section of Statement No 3; additional information will be provided, as appropriate, by the relevant Ministers.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Prime Minister will also be making a detailed statement on Public Service staffing matters in the next few weeks.
       </para>
       <para>
        SOCIAL SECURITY AND WELFARE
       </para>
       <para>
        I have already outlined our major initiatives in this area.
       </para>
       <para>
        I stress once again: The Government has a commendable record of directing assistance to those in greatest need.
       </para>
       <para>
        Over the term of the Hawke Government there have been significant increases in the real value of pensions and benefits, and large gains in assistance provided for children in low income families.
       </para>
       <para>
        This Budget continues the Government's focus on improving benefits for those in need, on removing anomalies and attacking fraud.
       </para>
       <para>
        In addition to the measures I have already announced, action is to be taken to prevent some people qualifying for dual benefits.
       </para>
       <para>
        From 1 November 1986, where a newly eligible war or defence widow pensioner is also eligible for a social security pension, the maximum level of the social security pension will be frozen at $60.05 a week.
       </para>
       <para>
        I mentioned earlier that some benefits to the most needy in the community were to be increased.
       </para>
       <para>
        To assist pensioners and low income families with children, there will be a $1 a week increase in the additional pension and benefit per child and a $1 a week increase in the rate of the Family Income Supplement from November 1986.
       </para>
       <para>
        In recognition of the difficulties and additional costs facing disabled people who undertake employment or vocational training, the mobility allowance will increase to $11 a week from November this year.
       </para>
       <para>
        The handicapped child's allowance will increase by $7 per month to $92 per month from November 1986.
       </para>
       <para>
        And also from November, the orphan's pension will increase by $4.30 to $60 per month.
       </para>
       <para>
        A clear need has been established for the Government to provide additional income support for 16 and 17 year olds who are the victims of abuse within their own families or cannot live at home.
       </para>
       <para>
        Consequently, a Young Homeless Allowance of $23.28 a week has been introduced to supplement the income these young people receive from education allowances or unemployment benefits.
       </para>
       <para>
        Expenditure in 1986-87 for that purpose is estimated to be about $9 million.
       </para>
       <para>
        HEALTH
       </para>
       <para>
        When dealing earlier with the Government's major proposals in the health portfolio, I stressed that we were adamant that health funding must be kept within reasonable bounds.
       </para>
       <para>
        Consequently, in addition to those other measures, we will investigate the payment of medical benefits which are growing at above average rates and review mechanisms for further restraining growth in health costs.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Isolated Patient Travel and Accommodation Assistance Scheme will be transferred to the States.
       </para>
       <para>
        Extra funding of $11 million this year and $22 million in a full year will be provided to the States and Territories to enable them to provide more effective arrangements.
       </para>
       <para>
        Funding has been increased in a number of important areas in the health portfolio.
       </para>
       <para>
        These include health promotion, public health, hepatitis B vaccinations, medical research, family planning and assistance to diabetics.
       </para>
       <para>
        EDUCATION
       </para>
       <para>
        I have already mentioned the Government's intention to impose an administration charge on higher education students.
       </para>
       <para>
        In addition, the overseas student charge currently applicable to university and CAE students will be extended to secondary, TAFE and other previously exempt higher education students from overseas.
       </para>
       <para>
        Together with increases in existing charges, this extension will yield $7.3 million, offsetting the costs of providing education to overseas students in Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        An anomaly exists in current arrangements whereby some social security beneficiaries can receive both student allowances and pensions or benefits.
       </para>
       <para>
        This is to be removed for new entrants from the 1987 academic year, saving $4 million.
       </para>
       <para>
        A special payment of $15 per week will instead be made to invalid and sole parent pensioners who are also students to encourage their education and later employment prospects.
       </para>
       <para>
        LABOUR AND EMPLOYMENT
       </para>
       <para>
        There has been a significant re-ordering of priorities within this function and, overall, a real cut in spending.
       </para>
       <para>
        Flowing from last year's decision to implement the Priority One program, expenditure on job training programs will increase by $67 million, including an increased allocation of $33 million for the Australian Traineeship System.
       </para>
       <para>
        This accords with the Government's intention that training and education opportunities available to our young people be significantly enhanced.
       </para>
       <para>
        Increased emphasis on training is to be complemented by reduced emphasis on Government job creation schemes.
       </para>
       <para>
        Consequently, outlays under the Community Employment Program will be reduced by $90 million to $200 million.
       </para>
       <para>
        The 2 per cent wage discount recently applied to wages is to be extended to former Commonwealth Government employees and Defence Force personnel receiving Government superannuation benefits.
       </para>
       <para>
        ABORIGINALS
       </para>
       <para>
        Assistance to Aboriginals will undergo a significant change in emphasis following the Government's endorsement of the general principles espoused in the Miller Report on Aboriginal Employment Training.
       </para>
       <para>
        The emphasis of existing programs will be changed from short-term job creation and welfare measures towards policies to establish long-term employment opportunities.
       </para>
       <para>
        Commonwealth expenditure directed towards Aboriginals will total $570 million in 1986-87.
       </para>
       <para>
        DEFENCE
       </para>
       <para>
        Real growth in defence spending has been cut to 1 per cent in 1986-87, a significant reduction on the 3.75 per cent allowed for in the Five Year Defence Program.
       </para>
       <para>
        Nevertheless, average real growth in defence spending under this Government remains greater than that under our predecessors.
       </para>
       <para>
        Recently the Government has begun the most thorough and comprehensive review of this country's defence priorities since the Second World War.
       </para>
       <para>
        In light of the Dibb Report and prevailing economic circumstances, the Government will now prepare a White Paper on Defence which will set down the development of Australia's defence capabilities well into the future.
       </para>
       <para>
        This report will reflect the need to maintain planning at achievable financial outcomes.
       </para>
       <para>
        Such a disciplined approach will ensure that essential changes can take place in equipment and force structure.
       </para>
       <para>
        CULTURE AND RECREATION
       </para>
       <para>
        The Special Broadcasting Service and the Australian Broadcasting Corporation are to be amalgamated, and their combined funding reduced by $16 million from last year's allocation.
       </para>
       <para>
        The specialised charter of the SBS will be preserved under the amalgamation.
       </para>
       <para>
        Gross savings from shared facilities, accommodation, equipment and administration in the amalgamated organisations should be about $2 million in 1986-87 and much greater in future years.
       </para>
       <para>
        We are also reducing the cost of administrative assistance to the arts.
       </para>
       <para>
        As a first step, the Australia Council's administrative expenses for 1986-87 are to be reduced by $1 million to allow increased support for the arts.
       </para>
       <para>
        A wide-ranging review of the Commonwealth's funding of museums is to be undertaken.
       </para>
       <para>
        The construction of the National Museum of Australia in Canberra will not proceed on the timetable previously conceived; its future will be considered following this review.
       </para>

        INDUSTRY ASSISTANCE
       </para>
       <para>
        All production bounties other than those applying to fertilisers and shipbuilding are to be reduced by 20 per cent from tonight, saving $43 million.
       </para>
       <para>
        There will be a phased reduction in the shipbuilding bounty rate from 25 per cent to 20 per cent.
       </para>
       <para>
        The consumption subsidy for fertilisers will no longer apply to imported products and the savings will be reallocated to increase subsidy rates on locally manufactured phosphatic fertilisers.
       </para>
       <para>
        The ban on uranium exports to France has failed to serve its original purpose and was in fact bestowing a benefit by allowing France to contract elsewhere for uranium at lower prices.

        From 1986-87 an annual charge will be applied to borrowings by the Commonwealth's business enterprises which are guaranteed by the Commonwealth.
       </para>
       <para>
        This measure is expected to raise about $7 million in 1986-87.

        RECEIPTS
       </para>
       <para>
        Madam Speaker, I have already indicated the major revenue measures in the Budget.
       </para>
       <para>
        I shall now give further details.
       </para>
       <para>
        The measures are more extensively described in Statement No 4 of Budget Paper No 1.
       </para>
       <para>
        MARGINAL INCOME TAX RATE CUTS
       </para>
       <para>
        Madam Speaker, the fundamental cuts to marginal income tax rates that I announced as the centrepiece of the Government's Tax Reform Package will proceed.
       </para>
       <para>
        The 60 cent rate will be cut to 49 cents, the 48 cent and 46 cent rates to 40 cents and the other marginal tax rates to 29 and 24 cents.
       </para>
       <para>
        These massive income tax cuts will produce a fairer and more efficient tax system, under which all Australian taxpayers will be better off.
       </para>
       <para>
        However, as I indicated earlier, the serious international economic predicament which Australia faces has required the deferral of the first stage of these tax cuts until 1 December this year, reducing the cost to revenue in 1986-87 from $2085 million to $1435 million.
       </para>
       <para>
        Legislation to give effect to the lower rates of tax, including those to apply from 1 July 1987, will be introduced tonight.
       </para>
       <para>
        These reductions are only possible because of the Government's moves to eliminate the inequities and abuses of our tax system which have persisted for so long and because of our demonstrated ability to restrain expenditures.
       </para>
       <para>
        They are an integral part of our overall program to establish the foundations for Australia's future economic growth and prosperity.
       </para>
       <para>
        SALES TAX
       </para>
       <para>
        To reduce the heavy tax discrimination against beer and spirits drinkers in favour of wine, the rate of sales tax on alcoholic wine and cider is to be increased from 10 per cent to the standard sales tax rate of 20 per cent from tonight.
       </para>
       <para>
        This is expected to increase revenue by $47 million in 1986-87.
       </para>
       <para>
        At present carbonated soft drinks and mineral waters are subject to sales tax of 20 per cent while other non-alcoholic beverages are exempt.
       </para>
       <para>
        In order to reduce this discrimination, sales tax at 10 per cent will apply from tonight to packaged flavoured milk, previously exempt fruit juice products and non-alcoholic wine and cider.
       </para>
       <para>
        This measure will yield revenue of $60 million in 1986-87.
       </para>
       <para>
        From tonight the rate of sales tax is to increase from 20 to 30 per cent on luxury cars and station wagons.
       </para>
       <para>
        This will affect broadly those vehicles whose retail price exceeds the depreciation cost limit for income tax purposes-that is $29,646 in 1986-87.
       </para>
       <para>
        The revenue yield in 1986-87 is $28 million.
       </para>
       <para>
        Avoidance of sales tax occurs through the device of selling only the discs and tapes on which computer software is embodied and licensing the consumer to use the software itself; sales tax is then payable only on the value of the discs, which is a small fraction of the total price.
       </para>
       <para>
        The sales tax law is to be amended, with effect from midnight tonight, to ensure that the taxable sale value of the computer discs or tapes encompasses the software on them.
       </para>
       <para>
        The production of ``in-house'' software will not be affected by the change, nor will exports of software or business purchases of software which are exempted as an aid to manufacture.
       </para>
       <para>
        Expected revenue raised from this measure is $80 million in 1986-87.
       </para>
       <para>
        Finally in the sales tax area, the Government has decided to change, with effect from midnight tonight, the classification for sales tax purposes of a number of goods so as to reduce anomalies and inconsistencies.
       </para>
       <para>
        The areas affected include swimming pools, hand tools, photographic developing and bathroom fittings.
       </para>
       <para>
        Details are provided in Statement No 4.
       </para>
       <para>
        BANK ACCOUNT DEBITS TAX
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bank Account Debits Tax rates will be increased from 1 December 1986.
       </para>
       <para>
        The highest rate will increase from $1.50 to $2.00; other rates will increase by up to a half.
       </para>
       <para>
        Revenue will increase by $45 million in  1986-87.
       </para>
       <para>
        PETROLEUM PRODUCTS
       </para>
       <para>
        I announced earlier that excise on petrol and diesel will increase 3 cents per litre with effect from tonight.
       </para>
       <para>
        This will yield $625 million in 1986-87 and $715 million in a full year.
       </para>
       <para>
        The decline in international oil prices and consequent reduction in import parity prices had substantially reduced Government revenue from the taxation of petroleum products.
       </para>
       <para>
        Even with this measure, total Commonwealth revenue from the taxation of petroleum products will be little changed from 1985-86.
       </para>
       <para>
        A.C.T. TAXES
       </para>
       <para>
        The Commonwealth Grants Commission has found that the financial contribution from the Australian Capital Territory continues to be low relative to that in the States.
       </para>
       <para>
        In those circumstances it is considered fair that revenue raised in the A.C.T. be increased.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Minister for Territories and I are releasing a separate statement detailing the measures to be taken, which include introduction of a land tax on business properties and increases in gambling taxes and stamp duties.
       </para>
       <para>
        PROVISIONAL TAX
       </para>
       <para>
        An anti-avoidance measure will be introduced to overcome arrangements whereby members of closely held partnerships or trusts have sought to avoid provisional tax by manipulating the distribution of income between partners or beneficiaries from one year to the next.
       </para>
       <para>
        This will raise revenue by $50 million in  1986-87.
       </para>
       <para>
        VALUATION OF NATURAL INCREASE IN LIVESTOCK
       </para>
       <para>
        The Economic and Rural Policy Statement of 15 April 1986 announced changes to stock valuation arrangements for animal stud breeders generally.
       </para>
       <para>
        As the tax deferral advantages associated with stock valuations are generally much greater for horse breeders, the Government has decided to restrict valuation changes to them, and then only in respect of service fees.
       </para>
       <para>
        Other animal breeders, such as sheep and cattle breeders, will not now be affected.
       </para>
       <para>
        A separate statement gives the details.
       </para>
       <para>
        COMPANY ACCOUNTING PERIODS
       </para>
       <para>
        A small number of companies receive substantial tax deferral benefits through adoption of an accounting year for tax purposes which finishes on a date earlier than 30 June.
       </para>
       <para>
        Relative to other companies, such companies are able to defer payment of tax for up to six months.
       </para>
       <para>
        To remove the tax deferral advantage, it is proposed to advance the due dates for payment of their quarterly instalments and assessments.
       </para>
       <para>
        This change, which affects only the timing of tax payments and not the size of tax liabilities, will be phased in over the three years starting 1986-87.
       </para>
       <para>
        Less than 5 per cent of all companies will be affected by the change, which is expected to yield about $220 million in 1986-87 and in each of the following two years.
       </para>
       <para>
        PAY OF DEFENCE FORCE RESERVE
       </para>
       <para>
        The Dibb Report on Australia's defence capability envisaged an enhanced role for the Defence Force Reserve.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government has decided to reinstate full taxation exemption of the pay of Defence Force Reservists from 1 January 1987.
       </para>
       <para>
        At the same time the special reserve allowance will be discontinued as an offset.
       </para>
       <para>
        MEDICARE LEVY
       </para>
       <para>
        As I announced earlier, the Medicare levy will be increased from one per cent to 1 1/4 per cent, from 1 December 1986.
       </para>
       <para>
        The estimated gain to revenue is $175 million in 1986-87.
       </para>
       <para>
        Threshold levels are to be raised to ensure that low income earners continue not to pay the levy.
       </para>
       <para>
        BENEFICIARY REBATES
       </para>
       <para>
        The taxation rebates for people receiving unemployment, sickness or special benefits will be increased again this year to ensure that people wholly or mainly dependent on such benefits are not liable to tax.
       </para>
       <para>

       </para>
       <para>
        ARTISTS
       </para>
       <para>
        From the 1986-87 income year, sportspersons and performing artists are to be eligible for income tax averaging provisions designed to smooth out tax liabilities on fluctuating incomes.
       </para>
       <para>
        Anomalies in the existing authors and inventors scheme are to be removed.
       </para>
       <para>
        PASSPORT FEES
       </para>
       <para>
        The validity period of Australian passports will be extended from 5 to 10 years and the fee increased from $30 to $60.
       </para>
       <para>
        MONETARY POLICY
       </para>
       <para>
        It is the Government's intention to shift some of the present burden from monetary policy.
       </para>
       <para>
        Lower interest rates would be compatible with stronger domestic economic activity and balance of payments adjustment provided other policies are taking more of the weight of that adjustment process.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is one reason why it has been so important to achieve substantial cuts in the Budget deficit and the public sector borrowing requirement in 1986-87.
       </para>
       <para>
        As I said earlier, total public sector gross borrowings are estimated to fall by over $2 1/2 billion this year.
       </para>
       <para>
        As a ratio to GDP, the gross PSBR will fall to about 4.4 per cent, compared with 6.0 per cent in 1985-86 and a peak of 8.1 per cent in 1983-84.
       </para>
       <para>
        Treasury Bond Tenders in 1986-87 are expected to total around $3 billion.
       </para>
       <para>
        In net terms there will be no new bond raisings.
       </para>
       <para>
        The whole program will be accounted for by the roll-over of maturing debt.
       </para>
       <para>
        The gross program compares with $5.7 billion in 1985-86 and a peak of $9.7 billion in 1983-84.
       </para>
       <para>
        Consistent with this reduced program, the Treasury is announcing tonight details of the next Bond Tender for an amount of $400 million.
       </para>
       <para>
        Last year's move to a more even spread of tenders over the year was well received.
       </para>
       <para>
        A similar schedule is planned for this year.
       </para>
       <para>
        These measures will help to ease pressures on domestic financial markets and to lower interest rates.
       </para>
       <para>
        Actual interest rate movements will depend also on what happens to overseas interest rates and to inflationary and exchange rate expectations.
       </para>
       <para>
        In assessing the appropriateness of monetary policy, we will continue to review a wide range of current and prospective financial and general economic indicators.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government's basic objective for monetary policy is for it to play its role in full support of other policies.
       </para>
       <para>
        We will maintain a firm monetary policy, consistent with the need to reduce inflation and to finance a current account deficit which is likely to remain large in 1986-87.
       </para>
       <para>
        CONCLUSION
       </para>
       <para>
        Madam Speaker, in conclusion I wish to return to the main theme of tonight's Budget.
       </para>
       <para>
        I have made it clear that our prime concern was to set in place the pre-conditions for a turnaround in the current account deficit.
       </para>
       <para>
        Already there is clear evidence that the underlying forces are working as expected.
       </para>
       <para>
        Last financial year there was a 7.4 per cent increase in the volume of Australia's exports.
       </para>
       <para>
        Import volumes declined quite sharply-in the first half of 1986 they fell at an annual rate of more than 10 per cent.
       </para>
       <para>
        This is the beginning of the necessary structural adjustments which I have described-the switching to new products and activities.
       </para>
       <para>
        But this welcome improvement in export volumes and reduction in import volumes were over-shadowed by the big falls in world commodity prices.
       </para>
       <para>
        As quickly as we lifted export volumes, export prices fell.
       </para>
       <para>
        And in the shorter term, while we still maintain our heavy dependence on primary exports, our problem with commodity prices is not going to go away.
       </para>
       <para>
        Large falls in import volumes are in prospect this financial year, and further export growth is expected.
       </para>
       <para>
        But once again we must expect those positive outcomes to be masked by poor prices.
       </para>
       <para>
        As a result, on present indications, little change is expected in our current account deficit as a percentage of GDP for 1986-87 as a whole.
       </para>
       <para>
        For seasonal and other reasons, we expect a number of large monthly deficits over the remainder of this calendar year.
       </para>
       <para>
        Looking further ahead, the fundamental adjustments now underway in the economy should help to achieve substantial reductions beyond 1986-87.
       </para>
       <para>
        Madam Speaker, when this Government was elected to office in March 1983 we inherited from our Coalition predecessors a massively debilitated economy.
       </para>
       <para>
        We faced a Budget deficit of unprecedented magnitude, double digit inflation, double digit unemployment and the first negative growth in 30 years.
       </para>
       <para>
        Over the past three and a half years, with absolute determination and the co-operation of the Australian people, we have overcome these legacies.
       </para>
       <para>
        With historic levels of economic and employment growth and our sweeping reforms to the financial and taxation systems, our record of achievement is an enviable one.
       </para>
       <para>
        Now there are new challenges to overcome.
       </para>
       <para>
        The sudden collapse in the prices of our exports and the resulting loss of national income has forced a range of essential adjustments on the nation.
       </para>
       <para>
        The 1986-87 Budget which I have presented tonight rings the changes on a more robust, aggressive Australian economy.
       </para>
       <para>
        Earlier I said that by resolute action and some sacrifice all round we can face and defeat any problem.
       </para>
       <para>
        This means staying competitive with the rest of the world and trading out of our difficulties.
       </para>
       <para>
        This is the only path to higher growth, real independence and greater prosperity.
       </para>
       <para>
        This will be this Budget's crowning achievement.
       </para>
       <para>
        I commend the Budget to the House.
       </para>

        This Bill seeks appropriations of the Consolidated Revenue Fund in 1986-87 totalling $4,733,724,000. Of this amount, $2,108,520,000 was authorised by the Supply Act (No. 2) 1986-87: The balance of $2,625,204,000 will be authorised by this Bill. The Bill provides for proposed expenditure on the construction of public works and buildings, the acquisition of sites and buildings, certain advances and loans, items of plant and equipment which are clearly definable as capital expenditure and expenditure on new policy initiatives for which legislation has not been approved previously. Provision is made also for grants to the States under section 96 of the Constitution and for payments to the Northern Territory. An amount of $130m is included under the Advance to the Minister for Finance, the same amount as was provided in the Supply Act (No. 2) 1986-87 which this Bill, when enacted, will subsume. Details of the proposed expenditures are set out in Schedule 2 to the Bill and the main features were outlined in the Budget Speech. I commend the Bill to the House.

        The purpose of this Bill is to appropriate moneys of the Consolidated Revenue Fund for the recurrent and capital expenditures of the parliamentary departments for the year ending 30 June 1987. The total amount sought is $50,694,000. Of this amount, $21,334,000 was authorised by the Supply (Parliamentary Departments) Act 1986-87, the balance of $29,360,000 being sought in this Bill. Details of the proposed expenditures are set out in Schedule 2 to the Bill. I commend the Bill to the House.

        This Bill gives effect to the Government's decision to abolish the Advisory Council for Inter-Government Relations following on the report of the Task Force established in September 1985 to review the ACIR. The Task Group presented its report in January 1986 after extensive consultations with the contributing parties and written submissions from the public. I have tabled the report earlier today in the House.
       </para>
       <para>
        ACIR was established by the Advisory Council for Inter-Government Relations Act 1976 with the object of improving inter-government co-operation between the spheres of Federal, State and local government through research and recommendations made under directions provided by Premier's Conference. In addition to representatives of governments, the Council has included representatives from the Commonwealth Opposition, and citizen members.
       </para>
       <para>
        As noted in the Task Group report, ACIR has not established a reputation for high quality research generally, and has tended to be remote from the practice of inter-governmental relations. Nor have its recommendations on the whole been acted on by participating governments. As a result ACIR has had limited success in improving inter-governmental relations, particularly Commonwealth-State relations. The decision to abolish the Council has been agreed to by all States and the Northern Territory, with the exception of Tasmania. The Government considers that existing mechanisms, including Premiers' Conferences and Ministerial Councils, are adequate to provide effective inter-governmental consultations without the need for a separate research body. I commend the Bill to the House, and I present the explanatory memorandum to the Bill.

        The purpose of the Bill I am introducing tonight is to amend the Freedom of Information Act 1982 and the Freedom of Information (Charges) Regulations to reduce administrative costs and increase revenues. The main points are:
       </para>
       <para>
        introduction of application fees for requests for access to documents and for internal review of decisions;
       </para>
       <para>
        to increase the hourly charge for search and retrieval of documents;
       </para>
       <para>

       <para>
        to exempt persons seeking personal income maintenance documents from all charges and fees;
       </para>

        to maintain after 1 December 1986 the present 45-day time limit for processing requests;
       </para>
       <para>
        to strengthen provisions for refusal of requests on workload grounds;
       </para>
       <para>

       </para>
       <para>
        to reduce the obligations on agencies to publish section 8 and section 9 statements and to report statistics; and
       </para>
       <para>
        miscellaneous amendments of a minor nature.
       </para>
       <para>
        Background
       </para>
       <para>
       </para>
       <para>
        As is clear from the introduction of this Bill tonight, the Government continues to be concerned by the costs of operation and administration of the Freedom of Information Act and by the very low contribution made by users towards meeting those costs. Honourable members will recollect that in June 1985 the Government issued new directions designed to maximise disclosure of information whilst reducing the costs of administering the Freedom of Information Act. Administrative aspects of those measures, particularly the clearance role of my Department, have been valuable in reducing the number of disputes about release of information. Furthermore, costs of processing requests have continued to decrease as agencies gain experience and improve procedures. However, the other major aspect of the Government's directions-changes to the Charges Regulations designed to simplify charging procedures and recoup a more significant contribution by users of the legislation-were frustrated by the Senate when the amendments were disallowed on 13 November 1985.
       </para>
       <para>
        In 1984-85 the operation and administration of the FOI Act cost the Commonwealth between $16m and $19m, depending on the precise allowance made for overheads, and the preliminary figures for 1985-86 indicate a cost between $14m and $16m. Although there is some indication that the total number of requests is levelling off-preliminary estimates for 1985-86 are 36,000 to 37,000 requests as against 33,000 in 1984-85-it is clear that administration of the Act will continue to involve very substantial Commonwealth expenditure. It is also clear that under the present charging structure only very small contributions will be received from users of the legislation-about $22,000 in 1984-85 and perhaps $60,000 in 1985-86-or rather less than half a per cent of the administration costs. Australia simply cannot afford such a situation. The problems identified by the Government in June 1985 remain. Ways must be found to reduce costs and encourage efficient use of the Act.
       </para>
       <para>
        Economic circumstances are such that the Government must take action now. In recent months an inter-departmental committee has been examining options for FOI costs savings. This Bill draws on the work of that Committee, though there will doubtless be further possibilities for longer term consideration when it reports. The operation and administration of the FOI Act is also currently under review by the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs. That wide-ranging review will doubtless encompass costs questions.
       </para>
       <para>
        Whilst the urgency of the current economic situation requires government action now, this does not preclude further consideration of the issues in the light of the reports of the inter-departmental Committee and the Senate Standing Committee.
       </para>
       <para>
        I shall briefly describe the main features of this Bill. Further details may be obtained from the explanatory memorandum. (Quorum formed)
       </para>
       <para>
        Application Fees
       </para>
       <para>
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill proposes a $30 application fee for all requests. This will cover the cost of basic administrative procedures involved in processing the request. The existing $8 charge in respect of administrative procedures will be subsumed in this fee. It will be necessary to pay the fee when making a request. Until the fee is paid there will be no obligation on the agency to deal with the request.
       </para>
       <para>
        Processing Charges
       </para>
       <para>
       </para>
       <para>
        The existing charge of $12 per hour in respect of time spent searching for and retrieving documents is to be increased to $15 per hour. This increase takes some account of increases in wages and other costs since the charge was set in 1982.
       </para>
       <para>
        Where requested documents cover sensitive areas such as security, law enforcement, business, policy development and the like, it is often necessary for agencies to consult widely about possible implications of disclosure and to give very careful consideration to the consequences. This can be a costly process which must often be carried out by senior officers. It has accordingly been decided to introduce a new charge of $20 per hour in respect of the time spent determining what access can be granted to a document.

        Internal Reviews
       </para>
       <para>
       </para>
       <para>
        Whilst internal review is certainly less costly than review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal, and is therefore a desirable intermediate stage, there is nothing in the existing charges structure to encourage an applicant to first consider whether he has been properly treated by the agency. He can always hope that review will result in release of more material, or in other favourable action, at no cost to himself. It is accordingly proposed that there be a $40 application fee for internal review of agency decisions.
       </para>
       <para>
        Personal Income Maintenance Documents
       </para>
       <para>
       </para>
       <para>
        No fees or charges will be payable by persons seeking access to their own personal income maintenance documents. The only exception will be where the person has already had access during the preceding three months and there has been no material change to the documents concerned.
       </para>
       <para>
        Remission
       </para>
       <para>
       </para>
       <para>
        The existing provision for remission of charges provides that account must be taken of whether a request relates to a person's personal affairs, whether payments would cause hardship and whether disclosure of the documents is in the public interest. The last criterion has caused particular administrative difficulty. In practice many claims for remission on public interest grounds have been generated by members of parliament who have other effective means of access to government information or by media organisations operating on a commercial basis which are well able to make some contribution towards meeting the costs of processing their requests. It is proposed to remove this as a mandatory consideration in considering remission of charges.
       </para>
       <para>
        The existing remission provisions are not procedurally suited to dealing with remission of the new application fees. A new section will permit remission of an application fee on the limited grounds that payment would cause financial hardship and that the documents related to the applicant's personal affairs.
       </para>
       <para>
        45-Day Time Limit
       </para>
       <para>
       </para>
       <para>
        As the Act stands at present the time limit for responding to requests would reduce to 30 days from 1 December 1986. Meeting this reduced time limit would require extra agency staff. It is proposed to maintain the present 45-day time limit.
       </para>
       <para>
        Refusal on Work Load Grounds
       </para>
       <para>
       </para>
       <para>
        Some requests have absorbed very large resources, adding up to many staff-months or even staff-years. Three difficulties have been encountered in applying the existing provisions in the Act enabling refusal of requests on work load grounds:
       </para>
       <para>
        First, only large requests directed towards classes of documents can be refused. Requests for large numbers of individually specified documents cannot be refused;
       </para>
       <para>
        Secondly, there is no simple test of what constitutes an unreasonable work load; and
       </para>
       <para>
        Thirdly, the tests take account only of time spent searching for and retrieving documents but not, generally speaking, time spent in consultation and deliberation regarding exempt content.
       </para>
       <para>
        The first difficulty will be met by extending the exemption to cover requests for large numbers of identified documents. As for the second difficulty, whilst it would seem to involve a substantial diversion of resources in a large department to spend, say, more than five full staff-days processing a single request, such a diversion of resources could totally disrupt a small agency or office, particularly if it arose when staff were heavily pressed by other commitments. It is not therefore at this stage proposed to introduce an absolute limit on work load.
       </para>
       <para>
        The test will simply be whether the likely total work in dealing with the request would substantially divert the resources of the agency from its other operations; would interfere substantially with the performance by the Minister of the Minister's functions; or would result in substantial delays in dealing with other requests. The last point has been introduced as it would seem quite unfair that one person who made a large request should be able to hinder access to government information by other persons.
       </para>
       <para>
        The third difficulty will be met by providing that the total work shall be estimated having regard not only to the location and retrieval of relevant documents but also to the consultation and deliberation involved in deciding upon exempt matter.
       </para>
       <para>
        Publication of Information on Agencies
       </para>
       <para>
       </para>
       <para>
        At present agencies are required to publish separately statements concerning their organisation and functions. This results in significant duplication of material normally included in agency annual reports. The Bill proposes that the publications be amalgamated.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Act also requires publication in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette of an index of manuals, guidelines and other internal documents used by agencies in decision-making. There has been little evidence of public demand for such materials sufficient to justify printing and publication in bulk. The Bill proposes that copies of the index be available for inspection and purchase at the information access offices already established. This `publication on demand' will avoid printing and publication costs without diminishing public access to the information.
       </para>
       <para>
        Agency Statistics
       </para>
       <para>
       </para>
       <para>
        I am currently required to report annually to Parliament on the operation of the Freedom of Information Act. A wide range of statistical information must be provided to my Department by agencies for this purpose at considerable cost. It is proposed to very much simplify this statistical information which must be reported. The Bill proposes a reduction to the minimum considered necessary for monitoring the general operation of the Act.
       </para>
       <para>
        Miscellaneous Amendments
       </para>
       <para>
       </para>
       <para>
        Apart from minor amendments consequential on the major changes described above, the Bill makes an amendment of section 45 to ensure that material provided in confidence to government by non-government sources will be protected even where the information has been incorporated in internal working documents.
       </para>
       <para>
        As the Health Insurance Commission now has certain functions in relation to investigation of Medicare fraud and overservicing it is no longer appropriate that the Commission should be totally exempt from the operation of the Act. Its transfer from Part I to Part II of the Schedule will provide that it is exempt only in relation to documents concerning its competitive commercial activities.

        Application
       </para>
       <para>

        Conclusion
       </para>
       <para>
       </para>
       <para>
        It is estimated that total revenue to be derived from the above measures will be about $4m per year. Additionally, the measures in relation to publication, statistics and burdensome requests will result in cost savings of about $4m. Together, the measures will reduce the net cost of the Freedom of Information Act by about $8m or 50 per cent. This is a significant contribution towards meeting the Government's budgetary objectives. Honourable members will note that these savings do not result from significantly reduced rights of access.
       </para>
       <para>
        The express exemption from fees and charges of persons seeking access to personal income maintenance documents will protect those who are most vulnerable in respect of access to information they need. The remission provisions will continue to protect other persons where hardship might otherwise prevent access to personal documents. In other cases requestors will make a contribution towards the costs of providing the benefit they receive. I commend the Bill to the House, I present the explanatory memorandum to the Bill.

        The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Canberra College of Advanced Education Act 1967 to provide for the imposition of the higher education administration charge by the college as announced in the 1986-87 Budget. The charge is to apply to Commonwealth institutions from 1987 on the same basis as will apply in the States. The Bill also provides for the exemption of certain categories of student from the charge as outlined in the statement of the Minister for Education (Senator Ryan) on tertiary education and the 1986-87 Budget. Under these arrangements the Government estimates the gross revenue collection by the college in 1987 at $1,540,000 which will result in the recurrent grant for 1987 being reduced by $1,386,000. I commend the Bill to the House, I present the explanatory memorandum.

        In the Budget Speech and in a statement issued tonight by the Minister for Education (Senator Ryan), the Government announced details of its tertiary education policies for 1987. The Government will maintain the momentum of its policies, including the maintenance of growth, provision for disadvantaged groups, the development of stronger links with industry, and the maint- enance of rational steady planning as the basis for decision making. To support continued growth in the system, increased resources are required and, as a result of Budget decisions, funds available to tertiary education institutions will increase by 2.6 per cent in real terms in 1987.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the budgetary circumstances outlined by the Treasurer (Mr Keating), however, the Government has decided to introduce an administration charge of $250 per higher education student per annum from 1987 as a contribution towards the administrative costs of institutional budgets. This Bill gives effect to the Government's decision in respect of higher education students in institutions in the States and Northern Territory funded by the Commonwealth. The charge will apply equally to all full time, part time and external students undertaking award course or courses which could form part of an award at a university, college of advanced education or other institutions where the Commonwealth funds higher education places.
       </para>
       <para>
        Institutions will be required to collect the administration charge at the time of enrolment. For each institution the Commonwealth general recurrent grant payable for a given year will be reduced by an amount equivalent to 90 per cent of the revenue estimated to be derived from the charge. The remaining 10 per cent of revenue, estimated at $9.306m for the States and the Northern Territory in 1987, will be retained by the institutions for expenditure within the institutions for their own purposes. The Bill provides for an appropriate adjustment to be made to payments in the following year where the reduction in grant does not match 90 per cent of the actual administration charge collected. The charge will be indexed on an annual basis according to CTEC processes for adjusting administrative-that is, non-academic-salary costs.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill provides for exemption from the charge for institutions' own award holders, full fee paying overseas students and both full time and part time students who are pensioners and beneficiaries in the categories eligible for an education allowance for full time studies. Beneficiaries under the age related education allowance scheme, incorporating TEAS, the post-graduate awards scheme, or PGA, and Abstudy grants, who are liable for the charge, will have their benefit increased by the value of the charge. Similarly, the overseas student charge applying to subsidised overseas students will be reduced by the amount of the administration charge.
       </para>
       <para>
        Under these arrangements the Government estimates gross revenue collections by institutions in the States and Northern Territory at $93.064m in 1986-87 of which the institutions will retain $9.306m for their purposes. Adjustments to student assistance benefits and the overseas students charge will cost $27.7m. Revenue from the charge is therefore estimated at $56.057m in 1986-87. Consequential changes in respect of Commonwealth institutions are being made in other Bills being introduced today. I commend the Bill to the House and take this opportunity to table the explanatory memorandum.

        The purpose of the Bill is to amend section 4 of the Overseas Students Charge Act 1979, to extend the charge liability to overseas students who enrol in government and private secondary schools, and courses at technical and further education level institutions for which Commonwealth funding is received. The intention is to recoup a proportion of the cost to the Commonwealth of supporting places for overseas students at Australian education institutions. Charge liability is also extended to include diplomatic and consular representatives, their staff and dependants, who undertake tertiary courses.
       </para>
       <para>
        The further purpose of the Bill is to amend section 6 of the principal Act to fix the charge rates for the 1987 academic year. The new levels of charge are indicated in the Bill. As foreshadowed in 1985, the increase in the overseas students charge proposed in the Bill, for university and advanced education level courses, raises the contribution of a new student or one who commenced the course after 1 January 1986 to 45 per cent of the full average cost of a place. In respect of a student who commenced the course before 1 January 1986, the charge represents 32 per cent of the full average cost, or an increase of 15 per cent over the 1986 level.
       </para>
       <para>
        The amount of the overseas students charge will be reduced by $250, the amount of the higher education administration charge to be payable by all higher education students in respect of the enrolment. TAFE overseas students who commenced their courses prior to 1 January 1987 will pay 32 per cent of the average Commonwealth contribution to TAFE costs, and new TAFE students will pay 45 per cent. All secondary school overseas students will pay a flat rate of $300. I commend the Bill to the House and take the opportunity to table the explanatory memorandum.

        The purpose of this Bill is to vary the categories of students exempt from the overseas students charge. This is affected by including in the Overseas Students Charge Collection Act 1979, through inserting section 4A, those categories of students who are exempt from the charge. The current exemption provision relating to a postgraduate student who is the holder of a scholarship to the value of at least $3,500 per annum awarded by an Australian institution is now limited to a person who has been granted such a scholarship and commenced study before 1 January 1987. It is also proposed to withdraw the charge exemption provision for a postgraduate student who is the holder of a scholarship awarded by the Australian-American Educational Foundation.
       </para>
       <para>
        The proposed extension of the charge, as from 1 January 1987, to postgraduate students who are awarded a scholarship by an educational institution in Australia on or after 1 January 1987, and to all Australian-American Educational Foundation scholarship holders, is expected to raise approximately $1.2m in 1986-87.
       </para>
       <para>
        The further purpose of the Bill is to amend section 7 of the principal Act to restrict the capacity of a department or authority of the Commonwealth to discharge the liability of a student to whom that department or authority has granted a scholarship or like award, to postgraduate scholarship holders who commenced study before 1 January 1987. I commend the Bill to the House. I take the opportunity to table the explanatory memorandum.

       <para>
        The purpose of this Bill is to make provision for the financing of the prospective Budget deficit in 1986-87 and in subsequent years together with the associated prospective deficits in the Consolidated Revenue Fund. Legally, payments from the Consolidated Revenue Fund cannot exceed moneys available to that Fund. In order to meet any prospective deficit in the Consolidated Revenue Fund it is customary to seek legislative authority to charge defence and other Consolidated Revenue Fund expenditure to, or reimburse the Consolidated Revenue Fund from, the Loan Fund. This Bill therefore seeks authority to borrow money for defence and other purposes and to enable certain other expenditures to be met from the Loan Fund rather than from the Consolidated Revenue Fund.
       </para>
       <para>
        I should make it clear, however, that the Bill does not authorise defence or other expenditures additional to those otherwise authorised by Parliament under annual Appropriation Acts and under Acts providing for special or standing appropriations. The Bill is simply a machinery financing measure-the provisions of the Bill in fact explicitly prohibit borrowings for expenditures additional to those authorised by the Parliament.
       </para>
       <para>
        Successive governments have, for many years, introduced legislation in the form of an annual Loan Bill to authorise the issue of moneys from the Loan Fund to meet defence expenditures or to reimburse the Consolidated Revenue Fund from Loan Fund in respect of certain non-defence expenditures. In view of the non-controversial, accounting nature of the legislation, which has been acknowledged by all the major political parties in the Parliament, the Bill has been drafted as standing rather than annual legislation. That is, the Bill would provide authority for the necessary financing measures for 1986-87 and subsequent financial years to the extent necessary in the light of the respective years' Budget deficits. Standing loan legislation will in no way detract from Parliament's ability to debate the Budget, nor, as I have already stated, does it impinge upon the Parliament's prerogative to authorise, and appropriate moneys for, expenditures for particular purposes.
       </para>
       <para>
        In the Budget Speech the Treasurer announced that the Budget deficit in prospect for 1986-87 is estimated to be some $3.5 billion. This gives rise to a prospective deficit in the Consolidated Revenue Fund of around $5.1 billion-the Consolidated Revenue Fund deficit can differ somewhat from the Budget deficit as some CRF expenditures and receipts are classified as financing transactions in the functional classification of Budget outlays and, for the purposes of the Budget figuring, certain Budget outlays are met direct from either the Loan Fund or the Trust Fund.
       </para>
       <para>
        Existing standing authorities enable some $2.5 billion of expenditure to be charged to Loan Fund in 1986-87, leaving a shortfall of some $2.6 billion for which separate funding authority is required. This Bill seeks authority to borrow moneys accordingly. The amount of borrowings that may be undertaken pursuant to the proposed legislation is, in the case of defence expenditure, the amount for which appropriation is sought for defence purposes in the Appropriation Bill (No. 1)-some $7.2 billion in 1986-87-and any moneys for defence purposes that may be approved in subsequent appropriation Acts for a particular financial year. The effective limit in 1986-87 is likely to be significantly less than appropriations as defence expenditures cannot be charged to Loan Fund until the legislation is enacted. The legal limit for borrowing for non-defence purposes is determined by the level of borrowing authority approved by the Loan Council. It is estimated that the 1986-87 limits will be sufficient to enable the financing of the Budget deficit.
       </para>
       <para>
        In concluding, I emphasise that the Bill does not authorise expenditures in excess of those which have already been appropriated by the Parliament under Supply, appropriation or other Acts. It does not in any way impinge upon the Parliament's prerogative to appropriate public moneys but simply provides a mechanism for financing expenditures previously approved and appropriated by the Parliament. In commending the Bill to the House I table an explanatory memorandum related to the Bill.

        Earlier this evening the Treasurer (Mr Keating) announced, as part of the 1986-87 Budget, a number of changes to the scope of the present wholesale sales tax system that are to operate from midnight tonight. This Bill, and two others I will introduce shortly, will amend the sales tax law to give effect to those changes. Given the comments already made by the Treasurer in his Budget Speech and the details contained in statement No. 4 of Budget Paper No. 1 and the explanatory memorandum being circulated to honourable members, I will do no more than outline briefly the changes proposed.
       </para>
       <para>
        Firstly, the rate of sales tax on alcoholic wine and cider and other similar fermented alcoholic beverages is to be increased from 10 per cent to 20 per cent. Secondly, certain presently exempt non-alcoholic beverages are to be taxed at the 10 per cent rate. These include packaged flavoured milk, non-alcoholic wine and cider and similar beverages and, broadly, all non-carbonated fruit juice products containing not less than 25 per cent by volume of Australian fruit juice.
       </para>
       <para>
        Another change concerns the rate of sales tax payable on luxury motor cars and station wagons, including four-wheel drive vehicles. Where the wholesale price for sales tax purposes of such vehicles exceeds $19,892, sales tax will be levied at the top rate of 30 per cent. The amount of $19,892 is the tax-exclusive wholesale price, on which sales tax is calculated, equivalent to a $29,646 retail price. This latter amount is the present upper cost limit on which depreciation is allowable on motor cars and station wagons for income tax purposes. This amount will be adjusted each 1 July in line with the indexation adjustment to the income tax depreciation limit.
       </para>
       <para>
        Finally, the Bill will correct a number of anomalies and inconsistencies in the various schedules to the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act. The main changes are: Firstly, all swimming pools, spa pools, spa baths and hot tubs and accessories, which are currently exempt from tax or subject to tax at only 10 per cent, will become taxable at 20 per cent. Secondly, the tax payable on certain film and video recordings will increase from 10 per cent to 20 per cent. Thirdly, household fittings and sanitary ware will be subject to tax at the same rate as other household items, namely 10 per cent. Fourthly, the rate of tax on gardening and industrial hand tools and machinery for business or industrial use will be increased to 20 per cent. Next negatives, transparencies and film strips that are produced from exposed film, will be brought within the sales tax base, at the 20 per cent rate. Purchases of computers, calculators and other scientific equipment by individuals such as teachers, students and others for use in schools or universities will no longer be tax exempt. Such purchases by schools and universities themselves will remain exempt. All aircraft, including hot air balloons and other similar aircraft, are to be eligible for exemption from sales tax if used for business or industrial purposes. Finally, several exemption items will be amended to confirm the scope of exemptions currently reflected in decisions of the Commissioner of Taxation. I commend the Bill to the House. I table the explanatory memorandum.

        The Sales Tax Laws Amendment Bill will amend Sales Tax Assessment Acts (Nos 1 to 10) and the Sales Tax Regulations. The specific changes are as follows: The value of computer software has traditionally formed part of the Sales Tax base where its value has been reflected in the selling price of goods on which it is contained. However, in recent times those marketing such goods have, purportedly to protect copyright, used the technique of licensing the use of the software, thus separating its value for sales tax purposes from its carrying medium, for example, a disc or tape, which alone has minimal value. The Government could not stand idly by and allow this erosion of the sales tax base, nor permit its spread to other areas such as the marketing of sound recordings or videos. Measures in this Bill will ensure that the value of computer software, sounds or visual images when licensed separately from the carrying medium is brought back within the sales tax base.
       </para>
       <para>
        As the Treasurer (Mr Keating) has already indicated in his Budget Speech, in-house production of software will not be affected by these changes, nor will software produced for export. Software acquired as an aid-to-manufacture will also remain eligible for exemption.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill does not seek to tax the electronic transfer of software by means of the telephone system or satellite communications. The Government will, however, be giving further consideration to this question.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill will also change the sales tax treatment of swimming pools that are constructed on site. In the past, their pools, which are at the top end of the market, were not subject to sales tax. From midnight tonight, the construction of the container or shell of such swimming pools will be treated as the manufacture of goods for sales tax purposes and subject to tax at the rate of 20 per cent.
       </para>
       <para>
        Until now the process of developing exposed photographic film did not constitute manufacture for sales tax purposes. This Bill will change that. The price charged for developing exposed film will be taxed at 20 per cent.
       </para>
       <para>
        Finally, the Bill will bring the Sales Tax Law into line with the Customs law, by ensuring that goods imported into Australia on a temporary basis may be entered for home consumption tax-free, where they will be for use in connection with an America's Cup yacht race in Australia or the Bicentennial celebrations.

        This is the last Bill in this package of three Bills. It will amend relevant sales tax rates Acts to remove references to the sixth schedule to the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act. That schedule is being repealed by the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Bill. Details of this Bill are also set out in the explanatory memorandum that has already been circulated to honourable members. I commend the Bill to the House and mention again that these three Bills, together as a package, have one explanatory memorandum which has already been circulated to honourable members.

       <para>
        This Bill will declare the rates of income tax payable by individuals and trustees generally for the 1986-87 financial year and for the 1987-88 and subsequent years. In so doing, the Bill will give effect to the significant personal tax cuts announced as part of the September 1985 tax reform package, and their introduction from 1 December 1986 as announced earlier tonight by the Treasurer (Mr Keating) in his Budget Speech. The tax cuts are to be reflected in lower pay as you earn deductions from 1 December 1986.
       </para>
       <para>
        Another tax reform measure to be implemented by this Bill will allow the tax-free threshold only on a pro rata basis in certain circumstances. The Bill will also declare the rates of income tax for 1986-87 payable on the 1985-86 incomes of companies, registered organisations and unit trusts treated as companies for tax purposes, as well as on the current year incomes of superannuation funds and certain other trusts.
       </para>
       <para>
        As announced in the September 1985 tax reform statement, the company tax rate is to be increased to 49 per cent in 1987-88 to help defray the cost of the new imputation system that is to apply from the commencement of that year.
       </para>
       <para>
        Legislation to declare that higher rate for 1987-88 and subsequent years, which will also be payable by trustees assessed in respect of trust income of non-resident company beneficiaries in 1986-87 and subsequent years, will be introduced later in these sittings. Accordingly, the rate of tax declared by this Bill for 1986-87 for companies and the other bodies taxed as companies will remain at 46 per cent. However, lower rates are to be declared by this Bill on the relevant income of some superannuation funds and on ineligible approved deposit funds as a consequence of the reductions in personal income tax rates. A further lowering of these rates, reflecting the second stage of the personal income tax cuts, will be contained in the later legislation to which I have just referred.
       </para>
       <para>
        I turn now in more detail to the personal income tax rate measures contained in this Bill. The personal income tax burden will be substantially reduced by an increase in the tax-free threshold from $4,595 to $5,100, and by a reduction of all marginal rates of tax, with major reductions in those rates applying at average and higher earnings. The reform of the rate scales will be in two stages. With effect from 1 December 1986 a five-step scale will apply and from 1 July 1987 this will reduce to a four-step scale. From 1 December 1986 the existing 25 per cent rate on income to $12,500 will be reduced to 24 per cent and the threshold level will increase to $12,600. The 30 per cent rate will reduce to 29 per cent and the next two rates of 46 per cent and 48 per cent will reduce to 43 per cent and 46 per cent respectively. There will be a significant drop in the highest marginal rate applied to incomes above $35,000 from 60 per cent to 55 per cent. From 1 July 1987 the marginal rates applying to income in the ranges $19,501 to $28,000 and $28,001 to $35,000 will both be reduced to 40 per cent, and the top marginal rate will drop from 55 per cent to 49 per cent. These changes to the rate scale will be reflected in the rates payable by non-residents.
       </para>
       <para>
        Because of the commencement date part-way into the 1986-87 financial year, the rate scale for that year is to be an average of the 1985-86 rate scale and the scale to apply from 1 December 1986-made up of five-twelfths of the 1985-86 scale and seven-twelfths of the new scale. The average rate scale will mean a tax-free threshold of $4,890 for 1986-87 with the rate of tax on incomes to $12,500 being 24.42 per cent. A rate of 26.5 per cent will apply in the income range $12,501 to $12,600, 29.42 per cent in the range $12,601 to $19,500, while for taxable incomes in the range $19,501 to $28,000 and 428,001 to $35,000 the rates will be 44.25 per cent and 46.83 per cent respectively. The maximum marginal rate applying to income over $35,000 will be 57.08 per cent.
       </para>
       <para>
        An adjustment is to be made to the maximum rate of tax on the unearned income of minors for 1986-87 to reduce the 60 per cent rate now applying to income over $35,000 to 57.08 per cent. For 1987-88 and subsequent years a flat rate of 49 per cent will apply to all unearned income of minors, subject to shading-in arrangements for such income just over $416. The rate of tax on trustees assessed under section 99a of the Income Tax Assessment Act will be 57.08 per cent for 1986-87 and 49 per cent in 1987-88 and subsequent years.
       </para>
       <para>
        I referred earlier to the adjustment in certain circumstances of the level of the tax-free threshold. In 1986-87 and subsequent years, this threshold will be available only on a pro-rated basis in the year of income in which a person first ceases full time education at a school, college, university or similar institution. The adjusted threshold level will be the proportion of the full threshold that reflects the number of whole months in the year when the person was not engaged in full time education, including the month in which such education ceased. Where income is derived in the part of the year before the person ceases education, the adjusted threshold level will be increased by the lesser of the amount of that income or the balance of the full year threshold.
       </para>
       <para>
        The tax-free threshold will also be available only on a proportionate basis where a person becomes, or ceases to be, a resident of Australia in a year of income. This measure will not affect the present treatment of non-residents receiving Australian social security pensions and repatriation pensions that are taxable in Australia. The provisions of the bill are explained in detail in a memorandum, a copy of which I now table. I commend the Bill to the House.

        This Bill will formally impose income tax for the 1986-87 financial year at the rates declared by the Income Tax Rates Bill 1986 that I have just introduced. As explained in my second reading speech on that Bill, the rates imposed on individuals, and trustees generally, reflect the significant cuts in personal income tax that were announced in the September 1985 tax reform package and are to apply with effect from 1 December 1986.
       </para>
       <para>
        No change is proposed for the 1986-87 financial year in the rates of tax, which will also be imposed by this Bill, on companies, registered organisations and unit trusts treated as companies for tax purposes. However, for certain superannuation funds and for ineligible approved deposit funds the tax rates will be lowered. This Bill will also formally impose provisional tax payable for 1986-87, and authorise the collection of instalments of tax payable by companies and unit trusts treated as companies on income of 1986-87 year of income. Details of the various rates are set out in the explanatory memorandum that has been made available to honourable members. I commend the Bill to the House.

        This Bill will amend various taxation Acts, mainly as a consequence of the reforms to be made to the personal income tax rate scale by the Income Tax Rates Bill 1986. The Bill will also give effect to some 1986-87 Budget proposals. It will amend the Income Tax Assessment Act to increase the taxable income level, at or below which the maximum pensioner rebate of $250 is available, from $5,595 to $5,914 in 1986-87 and to $6,142 in 1987-88 and subsequent years.
       </para>
       <para>
        The maximum levels of the beneficiary rebates will also be increased from $220 to $280 for married beneficiaries and from $170 to $190 for other beneficiaries. The income levels above which the rebates are to shade-out will also be increased. In addition, the Bill will extend the benefit of the beneficiary rebates to recipients of benefits or payments under the Commonwealth's Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme and the Adult Secondary Education Assistance Scheme. The changes to the pensioner and beneficiary rebates are to take effect from the 1986-87 year.
       </para>
       <para>
        Other amendments of the Income Tax Assessment Act will reduce the level of the rebates of tax available for net medical expenses in excess of $1,000, payments of home loan interest by a first home buyer and the assessable proceeds of certain life assurance policies. These rebates will be allowed at the rate of 29.42 per cent for 1986-87 and 29 per cent for 1987-88 and subsequent years.
       </para>
       <para>
        Also reflecting the changes in personal tax rates, another amendment proposed will adjust the method of calculating the amount of any rebate allowable where payments in consequence of a taxpayer's termination of employment are included in his or her assessable income.

        The Medicare Levy Bill 1986 will declare the basic rate of Medicare levy for 1986-87 and, until the Parliament otherwise provides, for 1987-88. As announced in the Budget, the basic rate of the levy is to be increased from one per cent to 1.25 per cent from 1 December 1986. Consequently, a composite rate of 1.145 per cent will apply for the 1986-87 financial year.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Bill also contains increases in the income threshold levels below which people with low incomes will not be called on to pay any levy. For 1986-87, individuals with taxable incomes of $8,030 or less, and married couples and sole parents with family incomes of $13,370 or less, will be exempt from the levy. The income threshold for married couples and sole parents will increase by a further $1,660 for each dependent child or student. An explanation of the Bill is contained in the explanatory memorandum which is being made available to honourable members. I commend the Bill to the House.

        The purpose of this Bill is to repeal the Australian Institute of Multicultural Affairs Act 1979 and the Australian Institute of Multicultural Affairs Amendment Act 1985. The legislation will commence on a day to be proclaimed. Its effect will be to abolish the Australian Institute of Multicultural Affairs-AIMA.
       </para>
       <para>
        I remind honourable members of the communique of the National Economic Summit Conference in April 1983, which stated:
       </para>
       <para>
        . . . the future well-being of this country depends upon the acceptance of the cultural, social and economic implications of a multicultural Australia.
       </para>
       <para>
        That aspiration is an important objective of the Hawke Labor Government and our hopes were expressed during the debate last year about the proper role of AIMA. We believe that enormous improvements were made to AIMA over the ensuing year but not sufficient to avoid a further re-evaluation.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Review of Migrant and Multicultural Programs and Services, ROMAMPAS, under the chairmanship of Dr James Jupp, which has recently reported, has convinced us of the need for a range of approaches that will more effectively ensure that multicultural principles are accepted. In dealing with diversity, we must use diverse approaches to achieve acceptance of the values and benefits of our developing identity built on multiculturalism. Government must take direct responsibility for achieving objectives, and we believe we are now embarking on an improved strategy for that purpose. Part of our strategy involves the setting up of an office of multicultural and ethnic affairs to be staffed and funded within my portfolio in the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs.
       </para>
       <para>
        The Government appreciates the contribution made by the Council and staff of the Institute to the cause of multiculturalism in our community. However, in our view the continuing life of AIMA is no longer the most effective means of achieving our objectives. The Institute will therefore be wound down and abolished before the end of this year at a saving of $1m during 1986-87 and $2m in a full year. This Bill protects the Commonwealth's interests in that process. In commending the Bill to the House I table a copy of the explanatory memorandum.

        The Customs Tariff Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1986 which is now before the House proposes the removal of the 2 per cent revenue duty applicable to imports from general tariff sources under item 71.07 in Schedule 3 to the Customs Tariff Act 1982. This item covers gold, including platinum-plated gold, unwrought or semi-manufactured. The removal of the duty is to take effect on the third day after the legislation receives the royal assent.
       </para>
       <para>
        The main commodity involved in the removal of the revenue duty is gold bullion. It is accepted by the Government that the duty is impeding the development of the Australian gold market by restricting imports and preventing the necessary liquidity in periods of peak demand. The gold market could become in important source or foreign exchange earnings as an export oriented service industry. With the removal of the duty, Australia could become an attractive alternative for secure storage of gold bullion because of its geographical remoteness from Europe and political stability, thus earning foreign exchange from storage fees and commissions.
       </para>
       <para>
        The removal of the import duty should have no adverse effect on domestic producers. In accordance with the Government's commitment to simplification of the Customs tariff, the removal of the duty has been extended to the whole of the tariff item which includes gold bullion, rather than splitting the item to remove the duty from bullion alone.

      </para>
      <para>
       I do so in the terms of the printed proposals which are now being circulated to honourable members. Excise Tariff Proposals No. 9 (1986), Customs Tariff Proposals No. 14 (1986) and Customs Tariff (Uranium Concentrate Export Duty) Proposals No. 1 (1986), which I have just tabled, introduce certain tariff changes in relation to manufactured tobacco, refined petroleum products and to uranium concentrate from the Alligator Rivers region in the Northern Territory. These changes give effect to measures contained in the 1986 Budget. These proposals are operative from 8 o'clock this evening by standard time in the Australian Capital Territory.
      </para>
      <para>
       Excise Tariff Proposals No. 9 (1986) increase the rate of duty on manufactured tobacco and certain refined petroleum products for the purposes of the Excise Tariff Act. Customs Tariff Proposals No. 14 (1986) make complementary changes to the Customs Tariff Act in respect of duties applying to imported manufactured tobacco and refined petroleum products. The increase of $1.90 per kilogram in the rate of duty applicable to manufactured tobacco in the Budget completes the alignment of the tobacco rate with that for cigarettes which was begun in the 1983 Budget.
      </para>
      <para>
       Customs Tariff (Uranium Concentrate Export Duty) Proposals No. 1 (1986) increase the export duty on uranium concentrate produced from the Alligator Rivers region in the Northern Territory from 11c to 80c per kilogram of anhydrous triuranium octoxide contained in the uranium concentrate. The duty, which has been imposed since 1980, is in recognition of the special costs of environmental monitoring and research activities related to uranium mining in the Alligator Rivers region. The increase reflects the Government's decision, made within the budgetary context, to move closer to recovery of the costs of this monitoring and research. Summaries of the alterations contained in these proposals are being circulated to honourable members.
      </para>
      <para>
       I also advise honourable members that the rates of diesel fuel rebate will increase in conjunction with the duty changes on refined petroleum products. The new rebate rates for currently eligible use of diesel fuel will be 23.884c per litre in respect of primary production, 21.496c per litre for mining operations and 18.185c per litre for other prescribed use in residential premises, homes for aged persons, nursing homes, hospitals and other institutions providing medical or nursing care. Honourable members will note that the rebate for eligible primary production remains a 100 per cent rebate of the duty and the new rebate rate for eligible mining operations effectively means no increase in duty payable. I commend the proposals to the House.

        —The answer to the honourable member's question, based on advice provided by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC), is as follows:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) In a staff circular issued on 20 October 1983, the Board of the ABC stated that it had resolved to support Mr Sims in respect of his costs because the Board accepts the principle of support for staff who are defamed in the course of their duties.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) The details of the limitations on the total costs the ABC has agreed to bear and the arrangements as to the disbursement of any damages awarded in relation to this matter are the subject of a confidential agreement between the ABC and Mr Sims.
      </para>
      <para>
       Prior to entering into the agreement, the ABC sought independent legal advice to ensure that any agreement it entered would not result in improper expenditure of public moneys and would not result in a commitment to an open-ended arrangement.
      </para>
      <para>
       The ABC has also made a point of publicising to staff that its decision in this instance was based on the particular circumstances, merits and facts relating to this matter and must not be taken as a precedent for other cases.
      </para>
      <para>
       Further, the ABC advised my Department on 7 March 1986 that the Corporation's solicitor has given a written opinion that a statement containing information as to any apportioning of damages between the ABC and Mr Sims may affect the current case of Sims V Wran. Therefore the ABC considers that it would be inappropriate to make further information public until the matter is resolved.
      </para>
      <para>
       Taking account of the legal advice given to the ABC I am therefore unable to provide all of the information requested by the Honourable member.
      </para>
      <para>
       However, I do accept that this information is of interest to the Parliament and upon resolution of the case I will advise Parliament of the conditions of the agreement.

        —The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) The 1984-85 Annual Report of the Export Development Grants Board indicated that the claimed value of outstanding claims as at 30 June 1985 was $44.3m representing some 3568 claims. The Report states that the expected cash payout figure for these claims, based on estimates made by the Board, is of the order of $28m.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Funds of $54m were provided by way of Advance to the Minister for Finance in June 1985 to reduce the backlog of outstanding claims. These Funds were additional to the 1984-85 Budget allocation of $125m and resulted from the Government's consideration of a recommendation by the National Export Marketing Strategy Panel (the Ferris Panel) on the EMDG claims backlog. As regards staff, a special task force was formed from within existing staff resources to assist the Export Development Grants Board (EDGB) process the additional claims. That is, no additional staff were recruited for this purpose. The task force operated during the period 11 March to 30 June 1985 and involved a total of 19 officers.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) As indicated by the Treasurer in his May 1985 Economic Statement, the savings of $48m under the EMDG scheme for FY 1985-86 relate to savings in the forward estimates of expenditure. These savings result from the implementation of amendments to the scheme from 20 May 1985 and a deferral of payment of some commitments into future years when the reduced cost of the amended scheme will make less of a call on the Budget.

       (2) The campaign is intended to run to 30 June 1988. Continuance of the campaign after that will depend on Army's assessment of its effectiveness.

       (5) The retention and recruitment campaigns were not expected to produce immediate results, given the normal lead time for processing inquiries and applications and testing applicants. The net monthly changes in Army Reserve strength since the campaign began are: July -49; August -147; September -113; October +27; November -28; December +155; January -78 and February -232.

      <para>
       (8) ARes strength has exceeded 30,000 on several occasions. The most recent being the period from July 1981 until May 1984. Current Army perceptions are that recent underachievement can be reversed by effective recruitment/retention advertising campaigns, improved administrative/management procedures within the ARes, and the positive benefits achieved through closer integration of the Ares and the ARA. The target and upper limit of strength are the same.
      </para>
      <para>
       (9) The projected active strengths are set out below. The efficient strength is only assessed at 30 June each year. As at 30 June 1985 it was 15,565 out of a strength of 22,722. (a) Not yet available, but 28 February 1986 strength was 23,257. (b) 30,000. (c) 30,000.

       My Department has not undertaken an investigation of the potential for uniform co-operative legislation similar to that implementing the National Companies and Securities Scheme. State co-operative legislation varies from State to State; it covers a wide area including housing, credit and rural co-operatives. Whilst the ideal of uniform legislation is most commendable its achievement would require an active desire, on the part of the States, for this to be achieved.

       Against the background of stringent budgetary constraints, it has not been possible to establish a National Transport Safety Board.
      </para>
      <para>
       Arrangements for investigating transport accidents or allegations of unsafe transport equipment which are subject to federal jurisdiction have been strengthened. The Federal Office of Road Safety now includes a unit which investigates all claims that equipment or parts for motor vehicles may be hazardous. These investigations may lead to possible vehicle safety recalls. Recent amendments to the Trade Practices Act 1974 will also facilitate safety recalls.
      </para>
      <para>
       Provision was included (section 70) in the Australian National Railways Commission Act 1983 for the Minister for Transport to establish an independent Board of Inquiry to conduct investigations into accidents involving AN. Two such Boards of Inquiry have been established since then.
      </para>
      <para>
       In the marine field the Navigation Act 1912 provides for investigation of accidents. Preliminary investigations are carried out by Departmental marine surveyors. In the light of a preliminary inquiry, I may request a Court of Marine Inquiry to investigate the accident. This is an independent judicial inquiry.

       CYSS grant funds are allocated to and administered by publicly elected Local Management Committees (LMCs) to operate a CYSS project within the local community for one year. In accepting a CYSS grant, LMCs agree to comply with the terms, conditions and procedures set out in the CYSS Guidelines and Departmental manuals. These include the provision of quarterly financial returns and an annual audit report, at the end of the grant period, to the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations.
      </para>
      <para>
       All applications for CYSS grants are submitted to the CYSS State Advisory Committees (SACs) which consider submissions against the CYSS Guidelines and also seek the views of local Federal Members on projects in their electorates. The SACs then make recommendations based on these factors to the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations who is responsible for approval of CYSS project applications.

       The Industry Training Services (ITS) Program is designed to aid and stimulate the development of training through all sectors of industry and commerce, including small business. The Program's aim is to use training to promote efficiency, productivity and safety as well as industry's capacity to cope with new equipment, new techniques and changes in processing and market requirements.
      </para>
      <para>
       Under the Program, funds are provided for the employment of Training Development Executives (TDEs) and Training Development Officers (TDOs) by National and State Industry Training Committees (ITCs), as well as for the development of new training programs, research into training needs, the production of training manuals and the promotion of training.
      </para>
      <para>
       ITCs also may receive training development grants. These grants are provided to enable ITCs to research training needs, develop training activities and products, to purchase minor items of training equipment and to promote ITC activities to the industry. Most projects are national in character, though some are undertaken in particular States.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Industry Training Standing Committee of the National Training Council recommends the allocation of funds for training development grants under the Industry Training Services Program.

       Assistance under the Skills in Demand (SID) program (now being progressively replaced by the Adult Training Program) is provided on a project basis where the proposed training will overcome a skill shortage, the training arrangement has the acceptance of both sides of industry, trainees successfully completing the training are assured of employment and the industry concerned contributes substantially to the cost of the course.

       Through its analysis of skills shortages in the labour market, the Department provides periodic information on those occupations for which training under SID may be considered. Funds have been allocated on a project basis as suitable proposals have been put forward.

        asked the Minister for Aviation, upon notice, on 29 November 1985:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) Did his decision to establish a committee to review the international air freight policy relating to export of primary produce arise from (a) a departmental request, (b) requests from primary produce exporters, (c) requests from air freight charter operators, (d) State governments or (e) some other source; if so, which source.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Was the committee, either by oral direction or by the terms of reference of the review, specifically limited to investigating only those areas of air freight policy relating to charter or non-scheduled carriers.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) Did the committee investigate (a) possible variations to the existing scheduled services or (b) variations to Qantas' current networking philosophy and practice, as a means of increasing primary produce export; if not, why not.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) Does the new air freight policy depend for its success on Australian charter operators being granted access to consolidated inbound cargo.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) Is access to consolidated inbound cargo within his powers to grant or is such access a bilateral matter requiring the consent of the source nation of such flights.
      </para>
      <para>
       (6) Did Qantas in its submission to the committee state that it derives no less than 83% of total cargo revenue from the carriage of inbound freight.
      </para>
      <para>
       (7) Did Qantas also state that outbound freight contributes a meagre 17% in revenue terms to cargo yield.
      </para>
      <para>
       (8) Do the other scheduled carriers operating to and from Australia experience similar percentages of revenue attributable to inbound and outbound freight.
      </para>
      <para>
       (9) Has he any evidence to suggest that non-Australian scheduled carriers or their governments, will willingly allow access to consolidated cargo from their countries destined for Australia, to non-scheduled Australian charter operators.
      </para>
      <para>
       (10) If non-scheduled outbound charter flights take place under this new policy, will each subsequent inbound flight carrying consolidated cargo result in a loss of cargo to Qantas and/or existing scheduled carriers.
      </para>
      <para>
       (11) Did the committee state on page 77 of their report that (a) the evidence presented to the committee indicated that round trip charter operations from Australia would not be viable solely on the basis of achieveable outbound freight rates, even with access to inbound consolidated cargo the viability of round trip operations would most likely be marginal, (b) there would normally be little interest amongst shippers in using a charter to fly inbound general cargo to Australia at rates above scheduled airlines rates and (c) charter aircraft would not fly unless sufficient cargo were found for the inbound legs and therefore it would appear that charter operations would need to ensure inbound cargo by matching, or undercutting inbound freight rates being offered at points of uplift for carriage on scheduled services, before round trip charters would be contemplated; if so, does this imply that the success of this new policy is based on non-scheduled operators taking commercial decisions to negotiate charter outbound flights with exporters and to negotiate access to inbound consolidated cargo with foreign governments to achieve round trip operations which the committee asserts, on the evidence presented to it, would have marginal viability.
      </para>
      <para>
       (12) How many new flights does he expect to operate in the 1st year of operation of this new policy.
      </para>
      <para>
       (13) Would a lack of new flights operating in the 1st year of the new policy indicate that (a) the policy was a failure or (b) there was little demand for such flights.
      </para>
      <para>
       (14) If there is little demand foreseen for such flights, why did he say in his press release that the new policy was a boon for primary producers.
      </para>
      <para>
       (15) Did Qantas state in its submission to the review that (a) in a situation where genuine demand exists for the carriage of primary produce out of Australia which is unable to be met by capacity available at the appropriate time on scheduled service, Qantas cannot, nor would wish to argue that such demand remain unsatisfied, (b) in order that all major aspects of the national interest can be served in these situations, they believe there is every justification for tests of (i) genuine demand for export to a given destination exists and (ii) prior availability of capacity on designated flag carriers in each case and (c) if these elementary inquiries show demand which cannot be met there should be no im- pediment to the procurement of outside capacity.
      </para>
      <para>
       (16) Was Qantas referring to tests to be applied to ad hoc operations; if so, are the comments of Qantas equally applicable to the consideration of applications for new scheduled services which are able to meet the tests applied by Qantas.

       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) The decision to hold the Review arose from representations received from both primary produce exporters and some State Governments regarding seasonal shortfalls in cargo capacity on scheduled services from certain Australian destinations.

       (4) No.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) Approval of international charter flights involves both the country of origin and the country of destination, and where applicable, overflight approvals from countries in between.
      </para>

      <para>
       (7) Yes.
      </para>
      <para>
       (8) My Department does not have access to commercial information of this nature.
      </para>
      <para>
       (9) To date there has only been one flight operated under the policy by an Australian based charter operator, namely IPEC. On that occasion IPEC did not seek approval to carry any freight on the return leg from New Guinea to Australia.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government of Papua New Guinea has on two occasions rejected applications from IPEC to operate 3 month programs of primary produce charters from Cairns to Port Moresby, following objections from Air Niugini. Again, IPEC did not seek approval to carry cargo on the return leg to Australia. Both applications were approved by the Australian Government.
      </para>
      <para>
       Transcorp Airways, which has operated the majority of flights under the primary produce policy, is not regarded as an Australian based operator. Guidelines for what constitutes an Australian based operator were published in Hansard on 26 May 1986. It should be noted, however, that on each occasion that Transcorp has sought to carry consolidated cargo to Australia in conjunction with an outbound primary produce flight, approval from the country where the inbound load was collected was forthcoming.
      </para>
      <para>
       (10) Granting charter operators access to inbound consolidated cargo will not automatically affect the loads of scheduled carriers. There could be situations, as has occurred in the past, where a temporary backlog exists for freight destined for Australia and scheduled carriers are unable to meet demand. In any case, the granting of approval to carry consolidated freight does not guarantee charter operators an inbound load. Charter flights must still compete for such loads in the market place and may not necessarily be able to match the price or level of service offered by existing scheduled services.
      </para>
      <para>
       It should also be noted that the primary produce charters are subject to a needs-based approach, i.e. charters operate where scheduled airlines are not able to carry the freight. This is administered by the Australian aeronautical authorities giving Qantas the right of first refusal on the outbound charter flight, provided Qantas can match the price and date of departure, and indicates its willingness to do so within 24 hours of notification of the charter. It is left to the aeronautical authorities of the destination country to assess the reaction of its national carrier.
      </para>
      <para>
       (11) Yes. However, an important objective of the policy change was to remove any unnecessary impediments to the operation of primary produce charter flights to allow exporters to test their market potential. Whether such flights actually operate is dependent on a range of factors, including buyer preference, harvest yields, and the commercial judgment of charter operators.
      </para>
      <para>
       (12) Accurate forecasts of that nature are not poss- ible. There are a number of variables including the success of the growing season, the value of the Australian dollar, the demand for Australian exports, available capacity on scheduled services, cargo rates offered and the attitude of other Governments.
      </para>
      <para>
       (13) (a) No.
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) Not necessarily.
      </para>
      <para>
       (14) Since November 1985 to the end of May 1986, my Department has approved 65 outbound primary produce flights under the new policy. This has had a significant impact on the amount of capacity available to exporters and has gone a long way towards eliminating the seasonal shortfalls in capacity and the associated delays and uncertainty which previously existed. It is now up to primary producers and their various marketing authorities to establish a more co-ordinated approach to testing and securing export markets.
      </para>
      <para>
       (15) Yes.

        —The answer to the honourable member's question, based on advice from the Overseas Telecommunications Commission (Australia), is as follows:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) Procedures open to the residents of Belrose to object to the construction of the Sydney Earth Station included all steps available to residents in any other construction project. OTC, though a Commonwealth business enterprise, has submitted to all of the local government planning processes. Indeed, unlike many developers, OTC convened a number of widely publicised meetings with residents by distributing invitations by letter box drop, advertising in the local papers and by writing to State and Federal Members of Parliament.
      </para>
      <para>
       Full details of OTC's plans were displayed at the Belrose Community Centre, where OTC staff invited comments and suggestions. In addition, models of the site, plan drawings and an environmental assessment were on display at the council Chambers for almost two months (during October and November 1985). During December OTC's development application was heard by the Council and, despite wide notice, not a single resident attended in person to oppose the development. Residents with concerns or suggestions were further encouraged to make approaches to OTC, to Members of Parliament and to Local, State and Commonwealth tribunals established for these purposes.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) As a Commonwealth statutory authority OTC is not bound by State or Local Government laws in the establishment of international telecommunications facilities. As with other public utilities, some residents in a particular area may consider that they are adversely affected by a development. OTC has always been mindful, however, of the need to explain its plans to local residents, to take into account local comments and criticisms and to seek ways of blending its developments in with local communities' wishes and expectations. Despite wide invitations to residents to lodge objections to OTC's proposals, only two written complaints were lodged with the Council in the case of the Sydney Earth Station and as mentioned above no residents appeared at the Council meeting discussing the proposal to speak against it.

       (3) (a) (b) (c) New master agencies were appointed, following a selection process based on the principles of open tender, for a three year period commencing on 1 October 1984:
      </para>
      <para>
       Monahan Dayman Adams (NSW) Pty Ltd, for Radio/TV/Cinema advertising;
      </para>
      <para>
       USP Needham (NSW) Pty Ltd, for press display campaign and miscellaneous advertising;
      </para>
      <para>
       Gordan &amp; Gotch Limited, for press non-campaign advertising.
      </para>
      <para>
       The first task for Monahan Dayman Adams and USP Needham was to negotiate rates for Commonwealth Government advertising (USP Needham for all press advertising including that placed by Gordon &amp; Gotch)-a process which takes place towards the end of each year, for the coming twelve months period.
      </para>
      <para>
       The negotiating principle followed by both agencies is based on volume. The higher the dollar volume, the lower the rates. In the case of television, Monahan Dayman Adams combines the potential spending power of all its clients (including Qantas and Westpac) as a lever to negotiate the best possible deal. The rates that are achieved are regarded by all parties-the individual media organisation or network, the negotiating agency and the Commonwealth-as commercial-in-confidence and not made public. In the highly competitive television medium, in particular, disclosure of special rates agreed to by networks or individual stations would be considered by them as a serious affront which would be prejudicial to any further negotiations between them and the advertiser concerned.
      </para>
      <para>
       (d) (e) Payment to master agencies is on a different basis for each. Contracts were awarded following the calling of open tenders and the best tenderer, both in terms of price and service offered, was selected in each category. With the existing contracts due to expire in September 1987, it would not be in the best interests of the Commonwealth to disclose the details of contracts with each company. The information has commercial value to intending contractors and could preclude the Commonwealth from arranging terms more favourable than the existing contracts.

       (9) Following endorsement of the Department's first Industrial Democracy Plan by the Secretary and all unions with coverage in the Department, the National Consultative Council was expanded to include three permanent sub-committees covering Equal Employment Opportunity, Industrial Democracy and Occupation Health and Safety. These sub-committees have membership drawn from both management and unions and meet regularly to pursue particular programs of activity determined by the Council. Other specific ID implementation action has included various initiatives taken by the Department and unions with a view to increasing union membership in the Department. In addition, the ID sub-committee prepared a questionnaire which was distributed in April 1986 to all white collar staff further explaining the concept and aims of ID and seeking their views on the form it should take in the Department. It is expected that analysis of this survey will be completed and a similar survey of blue collar staff will be completed in August 1986.

        —The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) Details of the number of persons whose pension is paid subject to the earnings concession are not maintained. However, it is estimated that some 4,000-5,000 persons may have been granted an earnings concession in a 12 month period.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) See (1) above.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) Details required to calculate the effect upon pension expenditure are not available. However, it is broadly estimated that the effect upon pension expenditure in 1985-86 (the year in which the concession is being phased out) would be less than $1 million and would be less than $2 million in each of 1986-87 and 1987-88.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) There is a wide range of possible effects on disposable income depending upon such factors as the extent of the pensioner's earnings, the period over which the earnings were derived, the level of other income and the rate of taxation applicable.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) and (6) The phasing out of the earnings concession followed a High Court decision which pointed to the fact that there is no basis in the legislation to allow application of the earnings concession. I was aware that the concession was to be phased out over a 12 months period as part of the total revised approach to overpayments following the relevant amendments to the legislation in that area in November 1985.
      </para>
      <para>
       (7) and (8) Given the lack of legislative support for the concession, consultation was not appropriate. However, welfare organisations have been consulted on the design of a substitute incentive for pensioners to enter the workforce which is free of the poverty traps, anomalies and inequities of the old earnings concession.

In addition, the Government has initiated consultations with welfare organisations to examine various options to provide an incentive for pensioners to participate in the workforce which is free of the poverty traps, anomalies and inequities of the old earnings concession. The Government is also continuing to examine possibilities for further amelioration of poverty traps and increasing work incentives among pensioners and beneficiaries generally.

That measure relates only to entities which would otherwise have been entitled to an income tax deduction for the particular expense. After 30 June 1986, the proposed tax on non-cash fringe benefits will apply in cases where entertainment to the benefit of employees is provided by an employer who is either wholly exempt from tax or does not derive assessable income from the activities to which the entertainment relates. It would apply to that extent, for example, to a dinner held at Government expense principally for members of EPAC where Commonwealth employees or Ministers attend.

        —The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) (a) (i) In 1975 a Working Party on the Measurement of Labour Productivity was established by the Minister for Labor and Immigration to consider the appropriate method of measuring labour productivity for wage fixation purposes. The Working Party Report recommended that labour productivity should be measured using market sector output (as the numerator) with labour input (the denominator) being market sector employment adjusted for hours worked and changes in the quality of labour. In addition, it favoured an adjustment to the measure of output for changes in the terms of trade to yield a measure of ``effective productivity''.
      </para>
      <para>
       Because short-term movements in productivity may be highly volatile, it was recommended that labour productivity estimates should be based on a long-term trend rather than on short-term changes. However, the current state of the economy (including short-term fluctuations in productivity and the terms of trade) should be taken into account in determining whether it is appropriate to increase wages or improve conditions of work on account of productivity growth. My Department supports use of this measure in the context of centralised wage fixation.
      </para>
      <para>
       (a) (ii) Official data that would enable the calculation of labour productivity in the small business sector are not currently available.
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) (i) &amp; (ii) Estimates of the amount of capital inputs used in the production process are difficult to quantify. Among the considerations for the measurement of capital are: how to aggregrate the capital stock-whether to use net or gross capital stocks; what depreciation rate and age efficiency assumptions are appropriate; whether to include land and inventories; and whether to adjust for capacity utilization. Because of the considerable conceptual problems which arise from such considerations there is no generally agreed method to measure capital productivity.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Productivity growth is normally distributed to the community in a variety of ways. It can result in improvements in the profit share and/or the wage share, or it can result in lower prices. Alternatively, the Working Party on the Measurement of Labour Productivity, noted above, suggested it can be used for other purposes ``either of a private character (such as increases in leave or reduced working hours or other improvements in conditions of employment), or of a community nature (such as expansion in the size of the non-market sector and the functions undertaken by government. . .)''.
      </para>

       (3) Report of the Working Party on the Measurement of Labour Productivity, AGPS, 1976, a copy of which is available in the Parliamentary Library.

       (4) The question of any change in wages or conditions of employment, including employer contributions to superannuation schemes, based on national productivity grounds is for determination by the Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission.

       The Government announced on 20 January 1986 that it will be providing ABC television retransmission facilities to 42 remote communities through the Remote or Underserved Communities Scheme (RUCS). The facilities are planned to be completed by 1988.
      </para>
      <para>
       In the meantime, the Government will continue to provide retransmission facilities for ABC television through my Department's ongoing Capital Works Program. This program provides the basis for extending or upgrading ABC transmission facilities in various centres across the entire country. All communities considered, but not selected for RUCS, will be considered individually for inclusion on this program. However, they will be competing for priority with other similar projects and their inclusion will be subject to the availability of funds in the context of the budgetary process.
      </para>
      <para>
       Any community not selected for provision of a Government-funded facility, either through RUCS or through the regular Capital Works Program, is able to consider building their own facilities under the Self-Help Broadcasting Reception Scheme. However, while every effort is made to simplify planning, licensing and administrative requirements under this scheme, Commonwealth funding through my Department is not provided under the self-help scheme.

      <para>
       The Statutory Marketing Authorities (SMAs) within my portfolio have responsibilities for export marketing. This involves export control, product promotion or, in the case of the Australian Wheat Board (AWB) export sales. In view of these responsibilities members and staff of the SMAs frequently travel overseas on marketing missions. The enabling legislation of the authorities provides them with powers to do all things necessary for the purpose of carrying out their functions.
      </para>
      <para>
       The SMAs are funded by producers through statutory levies or, in the case of the AWB, from the proceeds of wheat sales. Under the extremely difficult marketing conditions facing rural industries it is essential that the SMAs maximise commercial returns from expenditure of producers' funds. The details sought by the honourable member would require a significant commitment of those funds to extract and collate. This would involve an unreasonable diversion of the resources of the SMAs from the crucial marketing functions they perform for their industries.
      </para>

      <para>
       (1) Yes.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) No. As far as the ABC is concerned it obtains overseas program material from diverse sources and is not in a position to influence the style of captioning adopted.
      </para>
      <para>
       Each of the Australian commercial television stations purchase their overseas programs either independently, or more commonly, through a networking arrangement.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government does not have any control or influence over the purchasing practices of the commercial television stations. The only external regulation would be in terms of the Program Standards of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal (ABT). These standards do not, however, extend to prescribing such matters as placing the date of production in Arabic numerals.
      </para>
      <para>
       Concluding programs with the date of production in Arabic numerals is really a matter for the producer and is not a significant matter for Ministerial representations to the ABC nor Australian commercial television stations who purchase overseas programs.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) No. For Australian produced programs, the date of production in Arabic numerals is a matter first and foremost for the producers themselves and also possibly for the purchasers of those programs. It is not a matter which comes within the area of my responsibility just as it is not something upon which the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal has specified a standard.
      </para>
      <para>
       It would therefore be inappropriate for me to exercise any influence over how producers show the date of the production of their programs.

       Both the Investigations Branch and the Medical Division are directly responsible to the Commission's General Manager for their performance and action.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) All but one officer involved in duties associated with the investigation of medical fraud and overservicing are employed by the Health Insurance Commission on a full time basis. The only officer who is employed on a part-time basis is a Medical Adviser in the Hobart Office of the Commission, who is employed for twenty hours per week.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) No. The Fraud and Overservicing Detection System developed by the Commonwealth Department of Health was discontinued by the Health Insurance Commission following transfer of the investigation functions from the Department on 20 May 1985.
      </para>
      <para>
       (6) The Commission has developed its own procedures for reviewing the information contained within its data base. Experienced Review Officers examine data on all participating medical practitioners, however, peer-group comparisons as such are not routinely carried out by those officers. These new procedures have been developed within different areas of the Commission to assist in the detection of both fraud and overservicing.
      </para>
      <para>
       (7) The Health Insurance Commission is not prepared to provide details of the systems it employs, as the release of this information to Parliament would in effect be its release to the general public and such action may affect the Commission's effectiveness in auditing what is a major Government programme. However, should Mr Jacobi wish to observe the systems currently being used by the Commission to identify fraud and overservicing, Commission officers would be pleased to demonstrate them to him.
      </para>
      <para>
       (8) Details of the number of referrals to Medical Services Committees of Inquiry since 1980 are as follows: 1980, 8; 1981, 14; 1982, 20; 1983, 21; 1984, 16; 1985, 8; 1986, 8.

       (9) (a) The following are the amounts ordered by the Courts as restitution in successful prosecutions for breaches of the Health Insurance Act 1973 or the Commonwealth Crimes Act 1914 in cases involving medical fraud since 1980: 1980, $1,172.25; 1981, $9,306.65; 1982, $7,131.85; 1983, $6,539.70; 1984, $6,899.80; 1985, $5,175.70; 1986, $18,000.00.
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) The following amounts have been recovered from doctors for overservicing in each calendar year since 1980: 1980, $7,369.70; 1981, $31,075.16; 1982, $3,651.65; 1983, $48,908.31; 1984, $137,133.60; 1985, $15,324.05; 1986, $9,113.65.
      </para>
      <para>
       Following recommendations by the various Medical Services Committees of Inquiry, a total of $170,138.22 has been determined as amounts due to the Commonwealth as a result of overservicing. Of this figure, $69,779.40 was determined in previous years, leaving an amount of $100,358.82 outstanding for the 1985-86 financial year (i.e. in addition to the $9,113.65 already recovered). Six matters involving $40,823.70 are currently in the appeal period (30 days), whilst the remaining $129,314.52 involves eight matters that have been appealed against and which are awaiting consideration by Medical Services Review Tribunals.
      </para>

       A further three matters involving $9,601.33 are the subject of ongoing consideration by MSRTs, however, to date no recommendations have been forthcoming.

         Mr Peter Morris

       <para in-line="1">
        —The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) Yes.
      </para>
      <para>
       (a) Standard Instrument Departures have been devised at most airports in Australia where Air Traffic Control is in operation. They are designed to reduce pilot and air traffic controller workload by predetermining a path for an aircraft to establish itself on its outbound route. They also take into consideration other arriving or departing flight paths which may impose restriction to a pilot's preferred flight path.
      </para>
      <para>
       Additionally the Standard Instrument Departures take special account of environmental aspects by routing aircraft, where possible, over open or less built-up areas; for example at Sydney, over Botany Bay and via Bontany Bay Heads.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Standard Instrument Departures at Sydney are not restrictive by overseas standards and in most cases incur very little increase in distance to be flown.
      </para>
      <para>
       The author of the article has quoted the most restrictive Standard Instrument Departure, which applies to jet aircraft departing from runway 16 and proceeding to the west. A comparable procedure at San Francisco when departing to the east would, in some runway configurations, necessitate an aircraft reaching 13000 feet west of the airport prior to taking up its eastbound track.
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) Flow control restrictions at Sydney are more stringent than at Melbourne because Sydney is almost twice as busy an any other major airport in Australia, apart from those used exclusively or General Aviation.
      </para>
      <para>
       Additionally, with airspace limitations in the Sydney area, the benefit of extensive radar vectoring of aircraft is not always possible. At many overseas airports, aircraft are radar vectored over greater distances, often at lower levels, to achieve an orderly flow of air traffic.
      </para>
      <para>
       (c) Speed control is used frequently by Sydney air traffic controllers in order to reduce the need for aircraft to enter holding patterns. This cannot always be achieved when delays of more than approximately four minutes are necessary. The holding patterns usually flown are at medium levels away from residential areas alleviating noise nuisance as much as possible.
      </para>
      <para>
       (d) The spacing of aircraft at Sydney is in accordance with international standards. The author of the article appears to overlook the fact that the runway used for arriving aircraft is often the one used for departing aircraft. Thus for equity to departing traffic, the time interval between arrivals is usually two to three minutes.
      </para>
      <para>
       Large aircraft, such as Boeing 747s, take longer to vacate the runway after landing, and, even if departing aircraft were not a consideration, two minutes between arriving Boeing 747s would barely be sufficient. In addition, wake turbulence separation must be applied between most passenger aircraft operating in Australia. For example, the minimum distance between a departing Fokker Friendship and a Boeing 747 is six miles; or two minutes apart.
      </para>
      <para>
       Notwithstanding the limitations mentioned above, Sydney air traffic controllers are regularly achieving movement rates of between 55 and 60 aircraft per hour.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) My Department has taken and is taking further steps to improve the system and alleviate delays.
      </para>
      <para>
       Already in use is a system where, under certain conditions, aircraft can land on one runway whilst, simultaneously, others can land or take-off from the crossing runway. This system is limited to certain aircraft types by day, with specific meteorological conditions.
      </para>
      <para>
       The taxiway augmentation program approved by the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works has commenced. The program will reduce runway occupancy time to provide an estimated two per cent increase in practical runway capacity. This will achieve savings in runway operation delay costs and aircraft taxiing costs.

      <para>
       (1) The full implications of siting the second Sydney Airport at Badgerys Creek with regard to the facilities specified are as follows:
      </para>
      <para>
       (a) Kingswood Ammunition Storage Facility in its present form will have no adverse effect on Badgerys Creek due to a combination of normal aircraft performance operations and Air Traffic Control procedures which will keep aircraft clear of the Restricted airspace. Likewise Badgerys Creek will have no adverse effect on Kingswood.
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) St Marys Munitions Factory will have no adverse effect as projected future flight paths will take aircraft clear of the area. Conversely Badgerys Creek will have no adverse effect on St Marys.
      </para>
      <para>
       (c) As has already been identified in the Environmental Impact Statement the Fluers Radio Observatory could not co-exist with an airport at Badgerys Creek. Also reflected in the Statement is the fact that increased residential and industrial development in the area would seriously restrict Observatory operations in the future. Once this facility has been relocated the requirement for restricted airspace and its effect on the airport would no longer exist.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) The detailed airspace arrangements are matters for discussion between the Departments of Aviation and Defence through the interdepartmental Air Co-ordinating Committee.

       (4) No. Air Traffic Control procedures will be developed and airspace will be designed to overcome restrictions.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) My Department is confident that by working in co-operation with the General Aviation industry, we will arrive at a fair and equitable allocation of airspace that will meet the continued and developing requirements for General Aviation training.

In doing so, the Government recognised, as had the Coombs' Royal Commission on Australian Government Administration, the Reid Committee of Review of Commonwealth Administration and the report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts on the selection and development of senior managers, that the creativity and vitality of departments could be enhanced by the deliberate movement of staff at senior management levels. The transfers of the Secretaries of the Departments of Transport and Aviation were made in accordance with this policy.

       Yes. The Independent Inquiry into Aviation Cost Recovery rcommended that the costs incurred by Government in printing and distributing Air Navigation Orders and other publications should be recovered from the aviation industry. A draft plan has been developed, in consultation with industry and unions, to implement the recommendations of the Bosch Committee to recover the costs of regulatory services. The draft plan includes, inter alia, a proposal to recover the costs of printing and distributing Air Navigation Orders, Aeronautical Information Publications and other publications and amendments. Charges are not proposed for Airworthiness Advisory Circulars nor for the Aviation Safety Digest. The draft plan has not yet been considered by Government.

       The Department of Aviation is currently reviewing the policy and procedures for the distribution of operational documents in order to rationalise the process and minimise the costs involved and hence required to be recovered from individuals and the industry.

       I have seen no firm evidence to support claims that Vietnamese immigrants have been able to force Khmer out of desirable occupations of land. The Government has been unable to find sufficient evidence to verify the proposition that Vietnam is pursuing a deliberate policy of migration to Cambodia or of changing the ethnic balance there. We accept, however, that some movement of ethnic Vietnamese into Cambodia has taken place in recent years. Our current assessment is that there are about 300,000 Vietnamese residents in Cambodia, many of whom would appear to have been resident in Cambodia prior to the Pol Pot years.
      </para>

       The Australian Government has made it clear to Vietnam and the ASEAN countries that we would be seriously concerned if allegations that Vietnam intended to change the population balance of Cambodia were substantiated.

       (a) and (b) I understand that elections for the PRK National Assembly took place in mid-1981 and that there have been at least two sets of country-wide local council elections since 1979. In all these elections only members of the Kampuchean People's Revolutionary Party (KPRP) have been permitted to stand as candidates. We have received reports that more than one KPRP candidate has contested a single seat. The limited information on the internal situation in Cambodia which is available to the Australian Government, however, does not permit me to make categorical statements about the conduct of elections there. The Australian Government's views on the importance of freedom of political expression are well known.

       Vietnam and the Heng Samrin regime have frequently referred to the Cambodian situation as irreversible, but in other statements they have referred to the holding of free elections, excluding Pol Pot and his associates, after the achievement of a settlement in Cambodia. The concept of `irreversibility' appears to be intended to imply the rejection of a return to the pre-1979 situation rather than the rejection of the possibility of future change through elections.

       The Khmer Rouge's pre-1979 leadership appears to continue to hold power, despite Pol Pot's announced change of office in August 1985, when he became Chairman of the Kampuchean Republic's Technical Office of National Defence. Khmer Rouge support for the view that Pol Pot retains a substantial level of influence was implicit in a statement made on 30 December 1985 by Khieu Samphan, Vice-President of the Coalition Government of Democratic Kampuchea, to the effect that Pol Pot would cease all military or political activities in exchange for the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops from Cambodia by the end of 1986.

       The Kampuchean People's Revolutionary Party (KPRP) claimed, in its Fifth Congress Political Report of October 1985, to have a total membership of 7,500. Other observers' estimates have varied, with one academic authority suggesting a figure of 3,000. None of the estimates available to the government distinguishes between alternate and full-rights membership. The KPRP has a number of ancillary organisations: the People's Revolutionary Youth Union of Kampuchea, the Young Pioneers, the Youth Association and the Women's Association. It is possible that the discrepancies between the available figures on membership stem from a lack of precision about these membership categories.

       I understand that there is no minimum age of employment in Cambodia. The PRK authorities do not appear, however, to condone the use of young children in the labour force. The PRK is attempting to establish compulsory six-year primary education for all Cambodian children.

       The limited information available to the Government on conditions inside Cambodia prevents a full assessment being made of the extent to which the Vietnamese may be attempting to integrate the economies of Laos, Cambodia and Vietnam, particularly in respect of the exploitation of timber, rubber and fishing resources.
      </para>
      <para>
       Economic co-operation between Cambodia, Laos and Vietnam was formalised at the Indo-Chinese Summit in Vientiane in 1983 and is believed to be structured around a series of interlocking bilateral agreements in various fields. To date, co-operation appears to have been directed primarily at developing an integrated infrastructure to facilitate trade, for example interlocking road systems. Recent evidence suggests that the pattern of trade between the Indo-Chinese states is basically one of an exchange of Cambodian and Lao primary products for Vietnamese machinery, construction materials and consumer goods.

      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) The importation of uncooked pigmeat and uncooked edible parts of pigs is currently prohibited under Quarantine Proclaimation No. 90A.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) This Proclamation has been in force since 1977 and is unchanged. I have however recently considered a change to the Proclamation and to some associated regulations to allow the entry into Australia of uncooked frozen pigmeat from Canada.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) Yes. On 22 January 1986 I met a delegation from the Australian Pork Producers Federation. Members of the delegation were advised that any decision to lift the prohibition on uncooked pigmeat from Canada would be based on the development of procedures for producing the pigmeat which would ensure that no disease risk would result from any importation. Given the above the restriction on importation could no longer be sustained on quarantine grounds and Australia has international obligations not to use quarantine as a trade barrier.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) The major diseases capable of affecting pork production which remain exotic to Australia are foot and mouth disease, Aujesky's disease, swine vesicular disease, swine fever and African swine fever. There are a number of lesser diseases of pigs which are also exotic to Australia.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) In examining the feasibility of importation from Canada, it is relevant to note that Canada is free from the major diseases exotic to Australia. The remaining diseases of concern are transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) and trichinosis. The risk from trichinosis can be eliminated through freezing requirements included in appropriate importation conditions. Although no scientific evidence exists that TGE is transmitted in uncooked pigmeat, I have asked that Canadian authorities provide additional data on this possibility. My Department is awaiting the results of transmission trials currently being conducted by Agriculture Canada in Canada. On receipt of advice from Canada on the results of these trials I will be in a position to finalise a policy on possible future importation.
      </para>
      <para>
       The possible risk of Aujeszky's disease (which occurs in USA) has been raised as a concern by industry, however this disease does not occur in Canada. Detailed procedures can be developed for import of Canadian pigmeat which will provide ample safeguards against the theoretical risk of Aujeszky's disease. It is not a disease which has any significant history of spread to pigs through pig meat, and the evidence is that the virus survives for a limited time in frozen pigmeat. At our meeting in May 1986, the Australian Pork Producers Federation conceded that this was not a validly sustainable objection.

      <para>
       However I assume the honourable member's question relates specifically to ABS overseas arrivals statistics, which are based on data initially compiled by the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs (DIEA) from information contained on international passenger cards which are completed by all passengers arriving from overseas.
      </para>
      <para>
       I have made several representations to my colleague the Honourable Chris Hurford, MP, Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, and his predecessor the Honourable Stewart West, MP, urging that high priority be assigned to this issue.
      </para>
      <para>
       This matter has also been the subject of frequent communication between my Department and DIEA and ABS.
      </para>
      <para>
       I am informed that the delay in publication of these statistics largely reflects the time taken by DIEA processing staff to manually transcribe passenger card information into computer format.
      </para>
      <para>
       The resources available for this function are quite limited and it is a task which has also suffered from the incidence of repetition strain injury. The workload faced has also grown as a result of increased tourist arrivals.

       Yes. However, until such time as approval for the locations of the monorail footings is obtained from the relevant New South Wales Government Minister, the full impact on Telecom's services cannot be gauged and costs cannot be determined. Telecom understands that all relocation costs will be met by Thomas National Transport, the owner and developer of the monorail.

       No.
      </para>
      <para>
       Qantas on the one hand and the domestic airlines on the other would be affected by a decision on this matter. I believe that there is considerable merit in having an independent committee of inquiry investigating this matter, including the potential effects on traffic, and identifying options for consideration by the Government. For this reason the Government has decided that it will make a decision of the question of the restoration of Qantas' `interlining' rights following the report of the Economic Review of Domestic Aviation expected later this year.
      </para>
      <para>
       With regard to the America's Cup defence, I understand that Qantas has in place plans to cater for the extra demand during the October 1986-February 1987 defence period. These arrangements involve two additional weekly B747 services to Perth from Sydney as extensions of the Company's US services, and up to six ad hoc B747 services to Perth from Sydney, connecting with flights from the US. The Company is ready to provide on a supplementary basis additional services between Singapore and Perth, if required. Qantas will also make ad hoc calls into Perth on its 13 weekly Europe services, as demand requires.
      </para>
      <para>
       In conjunction with these services, the Company has developed marketing strategies to promote tourism to Western Australia for the Cup Defence. These include special promotional fares and tour packages to Perth, joint marketing and advertising campaigns with the Western Australian Government, and the establishment of a special liaison officer in Western Australia.

       There are no special arrangements or recognition for aviation contained in the Closer Economic Relations Treaty with New Zealand. However the Treaty recognises that the development of the relationship between Australia and New Zealand will be furthered by strengthening and fostering links and co-operation in such fields as inter alia, movement of people, tourism and transport. I am advised that the Closer Economic Relations Treaty is due for review in 1988 and that transport is one of the matters which will be considered in that review.

       I am aware of the role that aviation policies have in fulfilling the objectives of the CER Agreement. I firmly believe that the arrangements by which trans-Tasman air services are developed and operate are within the overall intent and spirit of the CER Treaty.

       (1) Yes. The matter was highlighted in an article in the Melbourne Age of 1 April 1986. However, the case in question was not the subject of any action by the Director of Public Prosecutions at that time. (2) I am informed by Telecom that, in Victoria during the last twelve months, 11 persons have been convicted for making offensive or harassing telephone calls.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) For many years Telecom operated under the assumption that call-tracing consituted an interception under the Telecommunications (Interception) Act and could only be disclosed by way of a prosecution of a person for making offensive or harassing telephone calls or in response to a subpoena.
      </para>
      <para>
       Recent advice from the Attorney-General's Department indicates that under certain circumstances a call-trace will not constitute an interception within the meaning of the Telecommunications (Interception) Act. Telecom is acting upon this advice to provide details of the telephone service from which an alleged nuisance call was made where this will not infringe the Telecommunications (Interception) Act.
      </para>

       (4) As the honourable member is aware, the Telecommunications (Interception) Act comes within the Portfolio responsibility of the Attorney-General.

       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) The revised system of tariff preferences for developing countries to be introduced on 1 July 1986 will result in the developing country rate of duty for canned pineapples reducing from 10 per cent to 5 per cent. As developing countries supply almost all of the imports (99 per cent in 1984-5) the developing country rate will be the rate of duty applying to most imports of canned pineapples.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) The level of assistance for canned pineapples recommended by the Industries Assistance Commission in 1982 and generally accepted by the Government at that time was that the long term rate of duty be phased down to 10 per cent and that no concessional developing country rate be applied.
      </para>
      <para>
       In taking its decision to introduce the new scheme, the Government was conscious that it would introduce new preferences where none existed under the current scheme. On the other hand, reduced margins of preference will now apply to some 790 items. Furthermore, the scheme establishes important new principles such as predictability, permanence, simplicity and broad coverage.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) The local canned pineapple industry supplies the bulk of the domestic market. The introduction of a preference margin is not of itself expected to seriously affect the competitiveness of the Australian canned pineapple industry. It must be borne in mind that local producers are successful exporters of canned pineapples indicating that they are in the main internationally competitive. Other factors such as the level of world pineapple supply relative to demand and movements in exchange rates are likely to also effect the competitiveness of imports on the domestic market.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) If the canned pineapple industry considers that it is being injured by imports from developing countries or any other source, and a case for assistance can be established, a reference on assistance arrangements appropriate to that industry will be sent to the Industries Assistance Commission.

        —The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) Mr John Peu and Mr Yann Uregei attended a conference of liberation movements in Tripoli in March.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Mr Peu is a member of FULK (Front Uni de Liberation Kanake), one of the constituent groups of the Kanak Socialist National Liberation Front (FLNKS).
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) No.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) Mr Peu was nominated by the FLNKS to staff the FLNKS Information Office which was opened in July 1985. He was issued with a temporary residence visa to enable him to work in the Information Office.
      </para>
      <para>
       As is the usual practice regarding the opening of such offices in Australia, the FLNKS Information Office is required to abide by the following conditions, namely:
      </para>
      <para>
       (i) that the Information Office is established for the primary purpose of disseminating information;
      </para>
      <para>
       (ii) that the office and its staff will not advocate violence as a means of achieving their political objectives;
      </para>
      <para>
       (iii) that the office will have no privileged status and its staff will have no special standing and will be required to abide by Australian laws; and
      </para>
      <para>
       (iv) that the office will not request or receive any financial assistance from the Australian Government.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) On 6 April 1986 the Government decided to decline a request by Mr Peu for renewal of his temporary residence visa. The Government's decision took into consideration that fact that the FLNKS had in effect itself suspended Mr Peu as its representative: a decision to suspend the operations of FLNKS `Foreign Ministry' was made by the FLNKS Political Bureau on 15 March 1986 in the light of projected travel to Libya by a number of FLNKS members, including Mr Peu.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government remains willing to consider nominations from the FLNKS leadership for an officer to staff its Information Office in Australia.

       (3) Development of the planning document was initiated by the military staff of the Department of Defence (Central Office) based on a perceived need to provide Government, in a short time scale, information on the ADF capabilities to respond to a crisis situation and ultimately to carry out Government directives.

        —The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) Where a person is unemployed as a result of an accident at work it is unlikely that unemployment benefit would be payable since the person must be able to undertake suitable work to qualify for such assistance. Where this condition is met, benefit may be paid if the person is unemployed, willing to undertake employment, is taking reasonable steps to obtain suitable employment, complies with the income test and is aged 16-64 (male) or 16-59 (female).
      </para>
      <para>
       Sickness benefits may be granted if the person is temporarily incapacitated for work, has thereby suffered a loss of income and meets the income test and age qualifications specified above.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Where sickness benefit is granted to a person who has a worker's compensation claim in respect of the same incapacity for which sickness benefit is paid, section 115B of the Social Security Act requires that sickness benefit be reduced by the amount of any periodic compensation payments received, and, where a lump sum settlement is made, the settlement is apportioned over time and any sickness benefit already paid is recovered in whole or part depending upon the particular circumstances. Sickness benefit is also reduced for the remainder of the period covered by the lump sum.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) The basic policy has not changed over recent years though the legislation was recast in 1982 when Division 3A, Part VII of the Social Security Act was introduced. This amendment improved the mechanics for recovery and removed the condition that recoveries could only be made where compensation and sickness benefit were paid for the same period. Similarly, the legislation passed by the Parliament in May this year provides a specified formula for apportioning lump sum payments over time and effectively precludes payment of sickness benefit for the period covered by a lump sum award.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) No separate statistics are maintained for persons having a worker's compensation claim who claim sickness benefit or the amount of sickness benefit paid in such cases. However, as at 2 May 1986 some 15.5 per cent of current sickness benefits were identified as either receiving or having an outstanding claim for some form of compensation such as workers' compensation or third party insurance. It is estimated that recoveries in 1985-86 will exceed $25 million.

       (1) The Commissioner of Taxation has advised me that some delays are being experienced in processing income tax returns where credit is claimed in respect of deductions made under the Prescribed Payment System.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) The main factor contributing to the delays is credit mismatches, i.e. where there is a discrepancy between the amount of credit claimed by the taxpayer and the amount of credit recorded on the Taxation Office files. The Commissioner explained that the majority of mismatches are caused by errors or omissions by taxpayers or their agents. However, he did acknowledge that some mismatches result from procedural problems with his Office.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Commissioner is presently reviewing procedures for dealing with these cases and expects to significantly reduce problems associated with mismatches.

        —The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) In 1974 the United States Congress addressed a long-standing dispute between the Navajo and Hopi Indian people, involving 1.8 million acres of land in northern Arizona, through the passage of the Navajo-Hopi Land Settlement Act which:
      </para>
      <para>
       (i) ordered the surface of the land partitioned equally between the two tribes;
      </para>
      <para>
       (ii) provided financial assistance for those people required to relocate; and
      </para>
      <para>
       (iii) established the `Navajo and Hopi Indian Relocation Commission' under the Secretary of the Interior to assist with relocation.
      </para>
      <para>
       I am informed that it was the intention of Congress that benefits to relocatees would be generous. The Settlement Act provides cash incentives and compensation for voluntary moves, improvements on the land being vacated, actual moving expenses, and replacement dwellings. With this in mind, the Commission submitted a relocation plan to Congress which became effective on 6 July 1981. Since the Act provided that relocation would take place in accordance with the Commission's plan, and be completed by the end of five years from its effective date, relocation of Navajo and Hopi Indians from land partitioned to the other tribe was to occur by 6 July 1986.
      </para>
      <para>
       This legislative settlement, however, created a number of problems, especially for Navajo Indians residing on what was established as Hopi Land. The Courts of the United States, including the Supreme Court, and the legislative and executive branches of the Federal Government have all been involved in this question.
      </para>
      <para>
       Although most Hopies have been resettled some 250 Navajo families, for various reasons, have refused to leave the land partitioned to the Hopi tribe. It is apparent that the 6 July deadline will not be met.
      </para>
      <para>
       A Bill to minimise relocation of Navajo families from the Hopi partitioned lands was introduced in the U.S. House of Representatives in February 1986. It would provide for land exchanges between the two tribes, require the Navajos to pay the Hopis about $300 million in mineral royalties, and settle legal disputes between the tribes. The proposed legislation has not been well received by all those concerned and its future is uncertain.
      </para>
      <para>
       At present, therefore, the Navajo-Hopi Land Settlement Act is the law in the United States. It requires the partitioning of land and the relocation of Indian people. Only the Congress of the United States has the power to amend the law.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) and (3) My Department's preliminary investigation of the United States Legislation does not reveal any apparent breaches of human rights.

      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) During trials to test an alkaline solution mining technique, which were conducted in 1985, a small amount of uranium (less than 500 kg) was leached from the ore body at Manyingee. These trials have now ceased.
      </para>

       (2) The material is stored at the test site in a storage facility which conforms with the physical protection requirements of the Australian Safeguards Office. The material is controlled by Total Mining Australia Pty Ltd, the operators of the joint venture exploring the prospect.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) and (4) I am advised the Manyingee prospect is covered by Exploration Licence EL 08-52, issued by the Western Australian Government. This licence is held by a joint venture comprising Total Mining Australia Pty Ltd (80 per cent interest), Elf Aquitane Triako Mines (10 per cent) and Urangesellschaft Australia (10 per cent). The venture is therefore 90% owned by French controlled interests.

      <para>
       (5) See (1) above.
      </para>
      <para>
       (6) The AAEC has made no specific comments on the Manyingee proposal nor has it made any general criticism of solution mining. It considers that this form of mining can have advantages over mining techniques in appropriate situations. The advantages or disadvantages are both site and operation specific.
      </para>
      <para>
       (7) The Government's uranium policy permits the mining and export of uranium only from the Ranger, Nabarlek and Olympic Dam mines. The Government will not permit the export of uranium mined at Manyingee and Total Mining Australia Pty Ltd is aware of this.

       (1) The $165,000 for studies associated with the implementation of separate airport and airway charges outlined in the Explanations for Additional Estimates of Expenditure for the Department of Aviation in 1985-86, is comprised of two elements: $100,000 for detailed design and programming of the Separate Charges Computer System and $65,000 for data processing utilising Bureau services. The additional funds for design and programming were required firstly because the successful tender price ($338,000) exceeded the original estimated cost ($300,000) and secondly, to cover changes to the system's initial design which have arisen during the course of consultations with the aviation industry. A decision was made to contract out the data processing for the system and funds were sought to cover data processing during trial running of the system for a period in 1985-86. These funds were offset by corresponding reduction in the relevant part of the Department's salaries requirements.

       One of the principles upon which immigration policy has been founded should be based on the premise that migrants should integrate into Australian society.

        —The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) The range and type of product being imported into Australia varies greatly and the responsibility for the control and testing of these products rests with different areas of government. Within each of these areas, there have been established relevant legislative and administrative systems to facilitate the control of any unsafe product, including testing of products where necessary.
      </para>
      <para>
       By way of example, responsibility for the identification of potentially hazardous health-related products rests with the Commonwealth Department of Health and relevant State Health authorities; air transport products are the responsibility of the Commonwealth Department of Aviation; products relating to road transport are the responsibility of the State transport authorities but action is co-ordinated through the Common wealth Department of Transport; electrical products are controlled and tested by relevant State and Territory authorities; firearm control is essentially a matter for relevant Police Forces; and other consumer products are the responsibility of the Attorney-General's Department at the federal level and consumer affairs agencies at the State level.
      </para>
      <para>
       There is no single administrative organisation with sole responsibility for control and testing of imported products. If it is considered that legislative action should be taken against particular unsafe goods at the Commonwealth level, controls can be invoked under:

       The enforcement of any such controls would be primarily a matter for the Australian Customs Service, the Commonwealth Department of Health, relevant quarantine authorities and the Trade Practices Commission respectively. Testing of goods for compliance with controls would generally be undertaken by appropriate independent technical experts such as the Australian Government Analytical Laboratory, State Government laboratories, Australian Federal Police, etc. Lines of communication have been established within and between relevant authorities to ensure that action to control and test imported products is co-ordinated.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Commonwealth and State authorities have established communication procedures to ensure unnecessay duplication is kept to a minimum. In some instances, differences in legislative requirements may result in duplication of testing to ensure compliance with different State limits.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) The product safety provisions of the Trade Practices Act can be used to prohibit the supply of unsafe goods or to establish mandatory product safety or information standards. From 1 July 1986, the Act will provide the Attorney-General with the power to require mandatory recall of unsafe goods. Actions taken under these provisions apply throughout Australia. To such extent that any provisions of State and Territory law are inconsistent with actions taken under the Trade Practices Act, the Commonwealth law would prevail.

        —The Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       The Commonwealth and States are co-operating in a national program of assistance to small businesses, with States providing direct assistance and the Commonwealth responsible for support services and co-ordination.
      </para>
      <para>
       Under this arrangement, the State Governments, through their Small Business Agencies and Corporations, provide a range of services for small business including counselling, referrals, general advice and, in certain circumstances, financial assistance.
      </para>
      <para>
       As a general rule, the Commonwealth does not provide direct financial assistance to industry or small business. This is regarded as a matter for the banks and financial institutions.
      </para>
      <para>
       However, in certain instances the Commonwealth does provide finance for small business under the Management and Investment Companies (MIC) Program which was introduced in early 1984. The main objectives of the program are:
      </para>
      <para>
       -to encourage the development of the venture capital market in Australia
      </para>
      <para>
       -to attract management and financial support for the start-up and early growth of Australian-based enterprises which generally have the potential to grow rapidly into substantial businesses, are export-oriented and use innovative technology; the Management and Investment Companies Licencing Board has so far licensed 11 MICs.
      </para>
      <para>
       In the area of small business management education and training the Commonwealth is keen to see a major drive to reduce small business failure rates by improving the managerial skills of small business owners. A national strategy for small business management education and training is currently being considered by Ministers and we will be seeking its implementation as soon as possible. In the near future we hope to implement a National Small Business Management Program in conjunction with the States, to encourage small business owners to develop their management skills.
      </para>
      <para>
       To assist small firms in various aspects of operating a small business the Commonwealth Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce has produced a wide range of management training materials, including a series of booklets on `Managing a Small Business'.
      </para>
      <para>
       Initiatives have been taken to assist marketing activities by local firms both in Australia and overseas. The Export Market Development Grants Scheme has been modified to ensure its cost effectiveness and to target funds towards assisting smaller firms. Separate export assistance arrangements have been made for the tourist industry, a major area of small business operations. Commonwealth purchasing arrangements have been reviewed to provide more effective preference for local industry in Commonwealth purchasing.
      </para>
      <para>
       From July 1985, the Federal Government has, in conjunction with the State Governments, progressively established the pilot New Enterprise Incentive Scheme (NEIS) in all States.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Scheme provides a comprehensive package of training, establishment capital, income support for 12 months, and business counselling for 600 eligible partici- pants. The Commonwealth is responsible for the income support element, which is broadly equivalent to Unemployment Benefit, as well as the training element which is in the form of full-time institutionalised training in small business management skills undertaken before the commencement of the business.
      </para>
      <para>
       Under the auspices of the National Training Council, a network of Industry Training Committees has been established covering some 80 per cent of the private sector workforce, the majority of which are employed in small businesses.
      </para>
      <para>
       Industry Training Committees are partly funded by the Government and aim to promote and develop systematic training on an industry basis and give industries a channel they can use to advise the Government, through the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations, on labour force and training matters.
      </para>
      <para>
       In recognition of the importance of training for small business owner/managers, the National Training Council established a Small Business Management Development Standing Committee in 1979 to stimulate awareness of the need for management training among small business owner/managers and intenders. The Standing Committee also facilitates communication on small business management development issues and provides advice for the National Training Council on policies, programs and priorities to meet small business management development needs.
      </para>
      <para>
       Small businesses have been significant participants in the various wage subsidy programs which have been administered by the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations. In 1985-86 it is estimated that the number of private sector placements under these programs will be around 70,000. The new JOBSTART wage subsidy program, which was introduced on 2 December 1985 and subsumed a range of former wage subsidy programs, has maintained this pattern. The program offers wage subsidies to employers as an incentive for them to engage long-term unemployed or especially disadvantaged job seekers. Recent information is not available, but past surveys indicate that 50 per cent of participating employers had a workforce of 7 or less, 85 per cent had 60 or less and 90 per cent had 100 or less.
      </para>
      <para>
       Under the Adult Training Program, assistance may be provided to small or other businesses under the National Skills Shortages component. Assistance is provided on an industry basis through special packages. The Heavy Engineering Adjustment and Development Program announced by the Minister for Industry, Technology and Commerce, Senator Button, will provide considerable assistance to small businesses in this industry. This will include skills enhancement retraining and relocation assistance for elements of the work force in the industry.
      </para>
      <para>
       Another component of the Adult Training Program, that geared to meet local labour market shortages, is anticipated to provide training to more than 2,000 unemployed persons in the six months ended 30 June 1986. This will meet the needs of various employers including some small businesses where there has been difficulty in filling vacancies.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Commonwealth is actively encouraging the development of technology oriented small firms and of the use by small firms of technological developments. There are a number of Commonwealth and State Government industry development measures to encourage pioneering of new products. These include grants for industrial research and development and encouragement to venture capital companies and financial and other assistance for enterprises developing new technology.
      </para>
      <para>
       In answer to the second part of the honourable member's question we are not aware of any proposal to establish a small business bank. The Government's deregulation of the banking sector and the issuing of new banking licences is expected to lead to a much more competitive banking sector more attuned to customer needs and a change in focus away from security lending towards cash flow lending.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Commonwealth Development Bank (CDB) provides finance for the establishment or development of business undertakings, particularly small undertakings, where finance is not available on suitable terms and conditions from other institutions. It is mainly concerned with the enterprise becoming or continuing to be successful and does not place the same emphasis as the banking industry on the value of the security available. All major trading banks are agents for the CDB.
      </para>
      <para>
       In May 1985 the CDB Act was amended to extend and clarify the CDB's charter as a lender of `last resort' to small business and make provision for equity finance. These amendments reflect a recommendation of the Martin Group which saw a lending role for the CDB in a deregulated environment which would provide greater attention to borrowers' income flow prospects.
      </para>
      <para>
       Figures as at June 1985 show the CDB as a net lender of $3 billion to 285,000 applicants since 1960. The ratio of small business to rural loan approvals has been 1:3 but in 1984-85 reflected a significantly increased trend in lending patterns to the small business sector. As at 1 March 1986 over $100 million had been loaned to small business-exceeding rural term loans for the first time.

        —The Minister for Resources and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) In the late 1970s the need for more stringent motor vehicle emission controls was considered by two national Councils: the Australian Transport Advisory Council (ATAC) and the Australian Environment Council (AEC).
      </para>
      <para>
       In July 1979 ATAC requested its Committee on Motor Vehicle Emissions (COMVE) to report on an effective long term national motor vehicle emissions strategy to achieve reductions in motor vehicle emissions. COMVE membership comprised relevant Federal and State environment, energy and transport authorities, representatives of the automobile and oil industries and, on behalf of consumers, the Australian Automobile Association (AAA). COMVE's study primarily involved a comparison of leaded and unleaded petrol strategies and it reported to ATAC in February 1980 that the unleaded petrol approach would be the best strategy to achieve health and environmental objectives in terms of energy conservation and overall cost. Further detailed assessments by COMVE confirmed this conclusion.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Vehicle Emissions and Noise Standards Advisory Committee of the AEC independently assessed emission control options and arrived at similar conclusions favouring the unleaded petrol strategy.
      </para>
      <para>
       In 1981, State and Commonwealth governments agreed to require all passenger vehicles manufactured from 1 January 1986 to be designed to operate on unleaded petrol and to comply with more stringent emission standards. The long lead-time was provided to allow the petroleum and motor vehicle industries to carry out development to meet the new requirements.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) COMVE's final report to ATAC reflected, inter alia, the conclusions from a study team comprising commonwealth officers and representatives of the oil and automobile industries, and from the AAA, which visited a number of other countries to investigate relevant issues. I am advised that at no time during discussions with authorities and experts in the United States and Japan was the question raised of hydrogen sulphide emissions from vehicles equipped with exhaust catalyst technology.
      </para>
      <para>
       The COMVE report on the development of a long-term national motor vehicle emissions strategy, published in February 1981, contains no reference to potential problems attributable to emissions of hydrogen sulphide gas.

       Car transport arranged by Department of Local Government and Administrative Services for my Department amounted to $495,282 in 1984-85. This figure includes the cost of using non-commonwealth owned vehicles arranged by that Department; it does not include the cost of vehicle services contracted directly by the agencies in my portfolio.

       (1) and (2) the Department of Primary Industry Corporate Plan will cover a medium term period, of about 3-5 years, in the first instance from mid 1986. It will be reviewed annually and updated when appropriate, to reflect prevailing economic and rural conditions, and the Government's economic and rural policies. Its focus and priorities will fully support the Government's intention, as outlined in the April 1986 Economic and Rural Policy Statement, to provide a basis for a more cohesive approach to rural problems across the community as a whole and to lay the foundations for a continuing long-term rural contribution to Australian economic growth.

      </para>
      <para>
       (4) Yes. Primary industry statutory authorities operate independently of my Department and are certainly able to develop for themselves the corporate plans required by their enabling legislation. The authorities and my Department do, however, consult regularly on all appropriate matters, and are aware of the strategies and priorities affecting each other's activities. All matters of Government policy or Departmental planning that may relate to or affect the authorities are made known to them at the time and do not need to await the formal publication of the Department's Corporate Plan.

        —The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) Up to the present, funds have been provided from CSIRO's Appropriation, the Australian Meat Research Committee (AMRC), now succeeded by the Australian Meat and Livestock Research and Development Corporation (AMLRDC), and the National Biotechnology Program Research Grants Scheme. The following funds were provided in 1985/86:
      </para>
      <para>

      </para>
      <para>
       A private firm is collaborating with CSIRO and is also in receipt of research funds from the National Biotechnology Program Research Grants Scheme.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) CSIRO estimates that for the vaccine to be taken to the marketing stage the following total funds will be required:
      </para>
      <para>
       $
      </para>
      <para>
       Research phase (3-5 years)... 2-3.5m
      </para>
      <para>
       Process development and field testing... 2.5m
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) It is expected that Appropriation funds will continue to be allocated at the current level. AMLRDC has indicated it will withdraw support from the end of 1985-86. The reason given is a change of priorities in AMLRDC away from animal production research to processing and marketing research. The National Biotechnology Program Research Grant terminates at the end of calendar year 1986. A new three-year research proposal has been submitted to the National Biotechnology Program. If successful, this will largely compensate for the loss of AMLRDC funding.
      </para>
      <para>
       When the stage of process development and field testing of the vaccine is reached, the firm collaborating with CSIRO will be expected to make a significant contribution to the costs of these activities. The Australian market for a cattle tick vaccine is estimated to be $30 million annually. Overseas markets would be at least three to four-fold greater.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) CSIRO believes that the principle of using `concealed' antigens, which is the basis for the cattle tick vaccine, could be applied to the development of vaccines against other parasitic diseases of livestock. CSIRO has already commenced research into a vaccine against sheep blowfly applying methods developed during the cattle tick research. The blowfly research is supported by a private endowment.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) CSIRO is not carrying out research on eye cancer in cattle. This is done by the University of Queensland.

       (1) Is it a fact that his Department advises tenderers for departmental contracts of changes to tendering specifications by telegram; if so, what was the cost to his Department of this procedure in (a) 1983-84, (b) 1984-85 and (c) 1985-86 to date.

       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) The alteration of tender specifications is of itself uncommon, and the promulgation of such changes by telegram/telex is only utilised in exceptional circumstances, particularly where the closing time is imminent. It is the usual practice in such circumstances for the Department to notify potential tenderers of the relevant changes by mail. The cost of issuing specification amendments by telegram/telex is negligible given their usage in isolated cases, and cannot be identified from the overall cost of the telegram/telex system.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Where a prospective tenderer is advised of a tender specification alteration by telegram/telex, normal practice would require the subsequent issue of written confirmation of the amendment forwarded through the mail.

       (a) and (b) Assessments of the threat to civil aviation operations in Australia continue to indicate a low likelihood of terrorist attack. It would be inappropriate for me to reveal details of the measures which apply at each of the 12 designated security airports. Nevertheless these measures are in accordance with the Airport Security Programmes approved under Air Navigation Order 99.1 and the Airline Aviation Security Programmes approved under Part XVIA of the Air Navigation Regulations and Air Navigation Order 99.0.

      </para>
      <para>
       (4) Australia compares favourably. However comparisons between Australia and other countries incorporate certain assumptions and provisos due to the various national legislative environments requiring differing standards and types of services. Based on the information issued by the Government departments and agencies concerned, the following annual aircraft movements per traffic separating controller have been determined: Australia 2,849, United States 2,684 and Canada 2,321. Equivalent figures for the UK are not presently available.

       (6) The planned modernisation of the Department of Aviation air traffic services system by the introduction of new concepts and technological developments will result in substantial productivity improvements. Total numbers of staff required to operate the air traffic services systems will progressively reduce as these improvements are made.

        —The Minister for Education has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) The Government undertook in 1985, a fundamental review of income support arrangements for young people, including the three general student assistance schemes-Secondary Allowances Scheme, Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme and Adult Secondary Education Assistance Scheme. As a result these schemes will be replaced from 1 January, 1987 by an age-related scheme with differential rates of allowances for 16-17 year olds and those aged 18 and over. Within each of these age groupings, the rates for secondary students will move progressively towards the corresponding rate for tertiary students until they are the same. This point will be reached in 1988 in the case of 16-17 year olds and in 1989 for the older age group.
      </para>
      <para>
       In terms of actual rates, secondary students in 1987 will receive maximum allowances of $40 at ages 16-17 and $45 if aged 18 or more; for tertiary and adult secondary students, maximum rates will be $50 (at home) $73.28 (away/independent) for 16-17 year olds and $55.80 for 18+ year olds.
      </para>
      <para>
       Education allowances will also be brought to a position of parity with unemployment benefit rates. Thus:
      </para>
      <para>
       from 1988, the rates of allowances for 16-17 year old students will be the same as for 16-17 year old unemployment beneficiaries
      </para>
      <para>
       from 1988, the rates for students 18 years of age or older living away from home or independently will be set at the same level as unemployment benefits for 18-20 year olds
      </para>
      <para>
       from 1989, the rates for secondary and tertiary students 18 years of age or older living at home will be set and maintained at 63 per cent of the away from home rate for this age group.
      </para>
      <para>
       These rate changes will remove the financial disincentives which currently discourage young people from low income families from continuing with, or returning to, education and training. Moreover, the rates of allowances will thereafter be indexed to ensure that they remain aligned and that their real value at least is maintained.
      </para>
      <para>
       The family income threshold level, i.e., the family income level at which the education allowances begin to be reduced, will itself be indexed annually to ensure that there is no drop in the proportion of students qualifying for allowances under the income test provisions.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government has also rationalised from the beginning of this year the payments made under the Training Allowances administered by the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations. Special schemes of student assistance including assistance for isolated children and the schemes assisting Aboriginal students have been examined by the Task Force on Youth Allowance Administration to advise on the extent to which they can be rationalised with the new allowance structure.

       (3) The extension of rent assistance to the long term unemployed was primarily intended, in the context of limited budgetary resources, to target extra assistance to a particularly needy group in the community. As I indicated to Parliament when introducing enabling legislation, this extension also recognises the increasing reliance on unemployment benefit as a means of long-term income support.

       (1) Yes, I was aware of the intention of the Commissioner of Taxation to distribute the booklet `Fringe Benefits Tax: a guide for employers' prior to the legislation being passed by Parliament.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Commissioner advised me that faced with the short time-frame likely between the passage of the legislation and the 1 July 1986 commencement date of the new system, he felt it incumbent on him, as a responsible administrator, to give employers details of the proposed tax at the earliest opportunity. As a result, he authorised the issue of the booklet with the express caveat that it had been prepared in advance of the legislation being passed by the Parliament.
      </para>
      <para>
       To have delayed publication until after the law had been enacted would, he considered, have been to fail in his responsibilities to employers and others affected. It would have undoubtedly given rise to large numbers of complaints that employers should have been given more time to be made fully aware of what is expected of them, to introduce systems changes and to prepare generally for the proposed new tax.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) The Commissioner has advised me that 750,000 copies of the booklet were printed and 440,771 copies were posted to employers. The balance have been distributed to Taxation Offices and copies are available to members of the public, upon request.

       (2), (3), (4) and (5). The Commonwealth Government provides direct support for energy research, development and demonstration projects through the National Energy Research, Development and Demonstration (NERD&amp;D) Program. The Program is administered by the Energy Research and Development Division of my Department.
      </para>
      <para>
       Each year, advertisements calling for NERD&amp;D Program grant applications are placed in the national press. The closing date for the receipt of applications for 1986 has now passed and advertisements calling for applications next year are likely to appear in March 1987.
      </para>
      <para>
       NERD&amp;D Program grant applications are assessed by the National Energy Research, Development and Demonstration Council (NERDDC) which makes its recommendations for support to me. Should a grant application be received to demonstrate a system similar to the University of Arizona's experimental house in Australia it will be assessed in competition with all other applications received.
      </para>
      <para>
       Since the inception of the Program in 1978 some $14 million has been committed to solar and wind energy research, development and demonstration projects. Passive solar design is also an important part of the energy conservation in buildings subprogram. An additional $3.0 million has been approved for RD&amp;D into energy conservation in buildings.
      </para>
      <para>
       Details of all relevant projects approved each year under the NERD&amp;D Program are presented in the attachment.
      </para>
      <para>
       (6) Funding for energy research, development and demonstration, including solar energy and energy conservation research under the Program is provided by an annual appropriation; in 1985-86 it amounted to $13.2 million.

        —The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) Yes I believe there is considerable scope for the application of Australian science and technology in India. There are several factors which point to this. For example there are many geological similarities. India, Australia and Antarctica were once contiguous in the super continent Gondwana Land. This is significant in relation to the mineral potential of the continents and the petroleum potential of the margins to mention just a couple. Additionally Australia and India share a common ocean which has major implications in areas such as fisheries and meteorology.
      </para>
      <para>
       The similarities augur well for the application of Australian science and technology.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Several steps have been taken over recent months to develop closer scientific links with India. In November last year, Australia took the initiative in forwarding to the Indian authorities a major research proposal in each of the fields of geoscience, meteorology and space science. We invited the Indian authorities to identify which of the three proposals was of greatest interest to them and in which they would wish to enter into a co-operative research effort. Additionally, as part of a broad thrust to improve science and technology links with India, my Department has invited a delegation of Indian scientists to Australia to look at what opportunities may exist. That delegation is to visit Australia for two weeks from the 10th of July this year.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) Australia has had a science and technology agreement with India since 1975 but most of our exchanges since then have been in agriculture and through various aid schemes. Australia has had interactions with India in scientific and technological fields over many years. For the most part these exchanges have been individual scientists working within government laboratories and universities.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) I confirm that Australia has yet to fully develop its scientific links with India. Indeed moves are afoot to strengthen those linkages. India has many sophisticated elements in its economy and technological infrastructure. Its major research organisation the CSIR (Council for Scientific and Industrial Research) resembles our CSIRO in some areas. Indian universities have done well in basic research, producing three Nobel Prize winners in science, less well in industrial applications.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) I am grateful for the Member for Hawker's interest in my leading a delegation to India to enhance scientific and technological links, however I consider it more appropriate for the senior officers of my Department to lead such delegations. Keeping in mind the proposed visit to Australia of an Indian scientific delegation (which includes some very senior scientists indeed) it is proposed that Australia sends a similar senior scientific delegation to India in August or September this year.

There were eight applicants for the position who were assessed by a selection committee against selection criteria. The selection committee consisted of a Deputy Secretary from my Department and two very senior officers from other departments. It was approved by the Public Service Board. Mr Delaney was ranked as the most suitable applicant and was recommended to the Public Service Board for promotion to the position. The Public Service Board confirmed Mr Delaney's promotion within the Senior Executive Service of the Australian Public Service.

       Wage and salary earners in the professions are covered by the same wage principles as govern other wage and salary earners. The Principles in the federal jurisdiction are set out in the 23 September 1983 National Wage decision (Print F2900). Similar principles were adopted by all State tribunals. The Australian Conciliation and Arbitration Commission's Principles were reviewed in the National Wage proceedings which concluded on 30 May 1986, and a decision is expected in the near future.

       (4) No. I am concerned that in this, and other instances, media releases and publications issued by the states have consistently ignored the role of the Federal Government in such projects. This omission is of particular concern where National Highway projects are involved, because the Federal Government meets the full cost of construction and maintenance. I have repeatedly raised this issue with State Ministers. Victoria's media releases, at least, now acknowledge Federal funding.

       (3) Yes, although as the honourable member would be aware, the 723 charters include other than just primary produce flights. The new policy has seen 67 outbound primary produce flights approved in the 7 month period from November 1985 to early June 1986. In contrast, under the previous policy only 73 primary produce flights were approved over the 2 1/2 year period from March 1983 to September 1985, all of which operated to Papua New Guinea, carrying very small quantities of primary produce.

       (1) Korean Air (formerly Korean Airlines) has itself made no formal application to the Government or to my Department for rights to operate services to and from Australia.
      </para>
      <para>
       However Korean Air has held a number of discussions with Qantas Airways Ltd which have included consideration of direct air services between Australia and the Republic of Korea. Whilst the two airlines have not agreed on the question of the viability of direct services between the two countries, they have established co-operative arrangements aimed at developing traffic flows over intermediate Asian ports.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) The matter of direct air services has been raised by the Republic of Korea on a number of occasions at government level and at official level, most recently at the Joint Ministerial Trade Talks between Australia and the Republic of Korea in Canberra on 13-14 May 1986. In recognition of the expanding relationship between the two countries, agreement was reached at this meeting that Ministers responsible for aviation in the two countries will establish a working group of officials to improve aviation arrangements between Australia and Korea, desirably through commercially viable regular direct services between the two countries. Among the arrangements to be considered is a bilateral Air Services Agreement. It was agreed that a meeting of the working group of officials of the two Governments will take place in Canberra or Seoul before the end of 1986.
      </para>
      <para>
       It is not possible to advise in advance of this meeting whether direct services may commence between Australia and the Republic of Korea and, if so, when this might occur.

      <para>
       (2) The Commonwealth provides financial assistance to nursing homes on behalf of residents to assist in meeting nursing home costs. This assistance is provided in one of two ways; either through the payment of Commonwealth nursing home benefits under the National Health Act to participating and State Government nursing homes or through deficit financing of approved costs of homes approved under the Nursing Homes Assistance Act conducted by religious and charitable organisations.
      </para>
      <para>
       The 5 homes funded by the Commonwealth in the Corangamite electorate are approved under the National Health Act to receive Commonwealth nursing home benefits; 4 of the homes are participating homes conducted by private enterprise while the Lorne Nursing Home is a State Government home.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Commonwealth usually sets nursing home benefits each November at a level whereby the benefit plus a minimum resident contribution of 87.5 per cent of the pension plus rental allowance will cover the fees charged in 70 per cent of beds in non-Government nursing homes approved under the National Health Act in each State.
      </para>
      <para>
       In May 1985 the Government decided to freeze the level of nursing home benefits payable to all Government homes and to participating nursing homes in Victoria, South Australia and the Northern Territory where benefits were already well above those applicable in the rest of Australia. Subsequent to this, however, the Government decided to increase nursing home benefits in South Australia by $3 per day effective from 14 November 1985 to cover the costs of the 38 hour week which was introduced in South Australia earlier in 1985, and was already allowed for in the level of benefit payable in Victoria.

       Relevant figures for the Electoral Division of Corangamite are not available but the Division largely corresponds with the area covered by Belmont Regional Office. Within that office, 4 cases with farm properties had their pensions cancelled following the annual 1 May review of asset tested pensioners, 11 had their pensions reduced and 41 had their pensions increased.

       (a) The valuations were made by valuers from the Valuations Branch of the Australian Taxation Office.

      <para>
       (b) The valuations reflect the current market value of the properties and were based on accepted valuation principles and on relevant sales evidence held by the Australian Taxation Office.
      </para>
      <para>
       (c) The majority of valuations were subject to a kerbside inspection.

       (5) The final report of the Joint Staffing Review was submitted to me and the Minister for Finance in April 1985.
      </para>
      <para>
       (a) Key recommendations were for:
      </para>
      <para>
       adoption in the short term of an Interim Staffing Model to determine necessary staffing levels in Social Security regional offices;
      </para>
      <para>
       development in the longer term of a model based more directly on work measurement; and
      </para>
      <para>
       a review of staffing needs in areas of State Headquarters.
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) Development of the longer term model and the review of State Headquarters staffing needs have not yet commenced. Conditions for proceeding with these projects have yet to be accepted by the relevant unions.
      </para>
      <para>
       (c) The base staffing level set for regional offices at the beginning of 1985-86 included an average operative staffing level (AOSL) of 9,745 derived from the Interim Staffing Model. This was 210 higher than the base AOSL for regional offices in 1984-85. However, it must be noted that client population levels differed in the two financial years and in any event it is not possible to say what AOSL would have been provided in 1985-86 had the Interim Staffing Model not been adopted.

       (2) Inquiries made by our Embassy in Vienna have indicated that there is currently before the Austrian courts a case involving the allegded ill-treatment of Mr Schwarz while in police custody in Vienna. An investigation was made by Austrian authorities into the allegations and criminal proceedings have been instigated against several police officers. Mr Schwarz and his wife, who are the main witnesses for the prosecution, have apparently not responded to requests to appear in court. Their present whereabouts are not known. The case therefore remains unresolved. The Department of Foreign Affairs will continue to monitor developments in this case and in respect of any other allegations of a similar kind. Pending the outcome of the legal process, it would be inappropriate to comment on the possibility of further action.

      <para>
       (1) Yes. The Department of Foreign Affairs receives regular reports on human rights in Chile from a number of organisations, including the Chilean Commission on Human Rights, the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, Amnesty International, the United Nations, and the Chilean Church human rights organisation, the Vicariate of Solidarity. The figures presented by the Chilean Commission on Human Rights covering violations in February 1986 are consistent with other assessments which indicate that abuses continue in Chile at a deplorable rate.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) (a) The Limited resources of our Embassy in Santiago restrict Australia's capacity to carry out independent investigations of abuses of the order reported by human rights organisations. Australia therefore relies considerably on the activities and reports of the organisations mentioned above. The Embassy has however investigated a number of individual cases which have been brought to my attention and, where appropriate, has made representations to Chilean authorities and visited detainees in gaol.
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) In 1986 Australia has continued to take a close and active interest in the human rights situation in Chile. At the forty-second session of the Commission on Human Rights in Geneva in March, Australia supported a resolution critical of the Chilean Government. It is hoped that the weight of international opinion, to which Australia contributes, will eventually be felt. In addition, our Embassy has investigated several specific allegations of human rights abuse, most recently in the case of two officials of the Vicariate of Solidarity. In Parliament on 29 May I expressed my concern at the detention of the two officials and about the human rights situation in general. Mr Beazley (representing the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs) commented on this issue, also in Parliament, on 20 May. Australian concerns regarding the officals have been communicated to the Chilean authorities, both in Canberra and Santiago. Officers of the Australian Embassy have visited the two officials in gaol.

       (2) I refer the honourable member to my answer to his question without notice on this matter (Hansard, 29 May 1986, page 4243).

       In 1945 Mr Justice Foster of the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration was commissioned to conduct an inquiry into and whether control of the industry should continue.

       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       The following table has been compiled from the 1976 and 1985 editions of the International Labour Organisation's Year Book of Labour Statistics for the period 1966 to 1984, which is the latest available time period.
      </para>
      <para>
       There are, however, relevant Australian Bureau of Statistics figures available for Australia for 1985 concerning the number of working days lost and working days lost per thousand employees. These figures are 1.255 million and 230 respectively.
      </para>
      <para>
       In examining the table, it should be noted that there are difficulties in making comparisons between countries on the basis of the ILO figures. This is because the definitions of what constitutes an industrial dispute, the statistical bases, and data collection techniques differ markedly from country to country.
      </para>
      <para>
       By way of example, the ABS and ILO figures for Australia include stoppages of 10 man-days or more which picks up quite small and short disputes. By contrast, whereas previously the U.S.A. used a threshold of 6 workers, since 1981 it has only recorded those disputes of more than one day's or shift's duration and involving more than 1,000 workers. It has been estimated that this change alone reduced the recorded number of days lost in the U.S.A. by between 30 and 40 per cent. Both the U.K. and West Germany count disputes involving more than 10 workers and of more than one day's duration, unless 100 or more working days are lost in which case shorter disputes or disputes involving fewer people may be counted. Canada counts disputes of 10 or more days lost or of more than half a day's duration. France has no restrictions on the size of disputes to be counted, but does not include public sector or agricultural employees in its statistics. Italy has no restrictions on the size of disputes counted.

       (1) None. All sponsorships lodged on or before 1 October 1985 have been processed.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) No. Fees are not imposed for sponsorship lodgement or processing. Fees relate to migration application and processing and are normally paid by applicants overseas although sponsors who lodge sponsorships with Regional Offices of my Department in Australia are asked to pay the $25 application fee on their relatives' behalf due to the difficulty which their relatives might otherwise face in paying the fee. Fees paid in advance by sponsors are refundable if applications are not subsequently lodged overseas. Up until 31 May 1986 applications where the $25 fee had been paid totalled 67,810 and those of the $75 fee totalled 16,014.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) None. All applications lodged before 1 October 1985 are exempt from the fees. An unknown number of sponsorships made over a number of years, and for which valid applications had not been lodged, lapsed on 31 December 1985. Such sponsorship can be renewed without disadvantage when the sponsor considers the relevant relative is able to lodge an application.

        —On 11 April 1986 (Hansard, page 2143), Mr Duncan asked the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, in his capacity as Acting Treasurer, the following question without notice:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       Has the Minister read an article in the Australian Business of 2 August 1984 entitled `Bending the tax rules with gold?' Is the Minister aware that gold bullion may be bought and sold anonymously in Australia with impunity? Is the Minister aware that anonymous trading in gold bullion is widespread and greatly facilitates tax evasion and money laundering? What steps will the Minister take to provide for the licensing of gold bullion traders and for recording the identities of all parties to each gold bullion transaction that takes place in this country?
      </para>
      <para>
       The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
      </para>
      <para>
       Further to the response of the Acting Treasurer on 11 April 1986, I advise that Commonwealth restrictions on the freedom of Australian residents to own, buy and sell gold in Australia were removed in 1976. However legislation existed in some States to regulate gold buying and some dealings in gold.
      </para>
      <para>
       As to the potential for tax evasion through buying and selling gold for cash, I have obtained some comments for the Commissioner of Taxation.
      </para>
      <para>
       First, I should point out that there is nothing illegal per se about a cash business transaction; like any other commodity, gold can be bought and sold for cash. It is recognised that tax evasion is attempted by means of concealing income arising from cash transactions.
      </para>
      <para>
       However, although cash transactions can give rise to problems in establishing a `paper trail', the Commissioner has a variety of techniques available to him to detect tax evaders and to assess their liabilities. For example, for purposes of the income tax law, he has a general right of access to records and premises that he can exercise in relation to those who provide gold sales and storage facilities . . . and he has power to require information from them. Provisions enacted in December 1984 in the Taxation Administration Act provide severe penalties for falsifying or concealing identity with the intention of deceiving the Commissioner of Taxation or hindering an investigation.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Commissioner can also employ indirect income measurement techniques to audit returns where a taxpayer has not kept adequate records of cash transactions. Essentially these techniques involve the compilation of a statement of source and application of funds, taking into account living expenses, and do not necessarily rely on an ability to focus on specific aspects of a taxpayer's affairs or to detect specific income transactions. For its part the Government remains committed to providing the ATO with sufficient audit resources to increase the level of audit coverage from the present 0.75 per cent to 2 per cent of non-salary and wage earners by 1992.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government is also sponsoring the Australia Card proposal which will have an impact on the cash economy. The proposals include the expansion of information reporting to the ATO. This expansion would reduce the scope for people to place funds or valuables under false names in investments, bank accounts or safekeeping facilities and should increase the likelihood of funds being invested where reporting measures apply.

        —The Minister for Education has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (a) In 1984, the Government provided $10 million for 3,000 additional places in higher education, with further increases in intakes of 1,300 in 1985 and some 2,000 in each of 1986 and 1987 being supported. After allowance is made for the flow through of these additional students into the second and later years of their courses (the pipeline effect), these measures will have provided in total over 22,000 additional places in higher education institutions. These increases have been largely directed towards institutions, such as those in outer metropolitan areas, which serve communities that have concentrations of disadvantaged groups. It has been emphasised that institutions should look to encouraging members of disadvantaged groups to take up the additional places.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government has also established the Equity Program, which provides funding for projects in institutions to promote equality of opportunity in respect of higher education. Projects funded under this program usually involve innovative approaches to encouraging members of disadvantaged groups to undertake higher education or to provide support for such students once they are enrolled. $1 million has been provided under this Program for each of the years of the 1985-87 triennium.
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) In addition to the measures described in part (a), which include projects incorporating bridging and support programs for Aboriginal students, 150 of the 1985 increased intakes and 200 of those for 1986 have been set aside for Aboriginals. The places have been funded at a higher rate than the general intake, in recognition of the increased levels of support required for these students, who in general have little experience of the higher education environment.
      </para>
      <para>
       (c) A number of projects funded under the Equity Program have been specifically directed towards increasing opportunities for women and girls in non-traditional areas such as engineering and the technologies. More generally, a condition of payments under the States Grants (tertiary Education Assistance) Act is that the State will ensure that the benefits of, and opportunities created by, such payments will, as far as possible, be equally available to male students and female students.
      </para>
      <para>
       (d) &amp; (e) Through the Equity Program, and more general measures, the development of a variety of entry modes to higher education is being supported. These include greater recognition of TAFE qualifications and work experience as a basis for entry into higher education, and the development of special forms of entry for mature age students who do not have a complete secondary education. Such measures recognise the needs and abilities of those who seek higher education as a means of upgrading their skills or who were denied the opportunity of higher education earlier in life.
      </para>
      <para>
       (f) The Government recognises the importance of adequate child care in expanding opportunities for many disadvantaged students. Funding for the building of child care centres at institutions and for the inclusion of child care facilities in multi-purpose buildings is available through the Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission's capital program. Institutions are able to provide the running costs of child care from their general recurrent grants, as is the case for other student services. Additional funding may also be provided by the Office of Child Care through its general allocations based on community needs.

       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) (a)-(h) The Government has made it clear that it is opposed to any extension of the arms race into outer space. This would include military bases, military installations, fortifications, weapons and military movements, and the testing and deployment of anti-satellite weapons or space-based anti-ballistic missile weapon systems by any nation. It does not endorse the SDI research program but recognises that the research currently underway may also have wider applications.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government firmly believes that arms control and disarmament would provide a more effective and lasting defence against ballistic missile attack than any ABM system and has consistently called on both superpowers to enter into balanced and verifiable agreement for significant nuclear arms reduction and for the prevention of an arms race in outer space.

       The School Evaluation element, is the only element under which school level projects were funded. Brochures outlining arrangements for such grants were made available each year to system authorities, education centres, national parent groups, teachers' unions and other groups for distribution to schools and to their clients. In 1984 a one page insert was placed in Education News, a publication distributed by the Department of Education to every school in Australia. Advertisements have also been placed in capital city newspapers, and in some years in major provincial city newspaers.

       (3) At the National level the Participation and Equity Program is administered in the schools sector by the Commonwealth Schools Commission. Joint Commonwealth-State committees for both government and non-government sectors have been established in all States and Territories. These committees are responsible for advising at the State and Territory level on the administration and implementation of the Program in accordance with the guidelines provided by the Commonwealth Minister for Education.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) Approval of projects and the allocation of funds is undertaken in two stages. Each year the Commonwealth Minister for Education or her delegate approves a program of activities submitted by each State and Territory government and non-government Participation and Equity Program Committee. These programs comprise an outline, in some detail including funding levels, of initiatives to be conducted in schools and at the system level. The second stage involves the identification of individual projects and grants and the forwarding of this information to the Commission.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) The following government schools in the Richmond electorate have been designated target schools and received priority funding in 1984 and 1985:

      </para>
      <para>

      <para>
       Funding details for 1986 are not yet available.
      </para>
      <para>
       (6) to (9) These details are not available at the Commonwealth level.
      </para>
      <para>
       (10) In the main, PEP is not a submission or application based program. The bulk of funds is allocated to target schools designated by the State Program Committees as those schools serving the most disadvantaged students. Once targeted, schools' Participation and Equity Committees plan and develop proposals focussing specifically on the problems and difficulties which lead to their inclusion in the Program. The remainder of funds is directed at system level activities which may impact on all schools.
      </para>
      <para>
       In the New South Wales government system in 1985 some funds were available for activities in non-targeted schools. Advice about the availability of funds for this category of schools was issued by the New South Wales Department of Education to all New South Wales government schools with secondary enrolments. Funding proposals were approved by the State Program Committee on advice from regional PEP committees.
      </para>
      <para>
       System level funds have been made available for the conduct of activities by community organisations. Advertisements calling for applications for the funding in this category of projects are placed by the New South Wales Education Department in the Daily Telegraph, the Sydney Morning Herald and the newsletter of the Youth Affairs Council of New South Wales.
      </para>
      <para>
       In November 1985, 500 handbills advertising the available funds were distributed to local government agencies throughout the State. Advertisements were also placed in provincial newspapers.
      </para>
      <para>
       (11) No specific action has been taken by the Commonwealth to advertise the Program in the Electoral Division of Richmond. However, at the beginning of 1984 copies of the Commission's report on the philosophy and development of the Program, Participation and Equity in Australian Schools: The Goal of Full Secondary Education, were forwarded to all Australian schools with secondary enrolments. Program guidelines (titled Commonwealth Programs for Schools in 1986), outline the administration guidelines for Commonwealth Schools Commission programs (and in 1986 certain Department of Education programs) and are sent out to every school in Australia. State systems also distribute to all schools details of the administration of the Program.

      <para>
       (4) Each year the Commonwealth Minister for Education or her delegate approves a program of activities submitted by each State and Territory. All States/Territories have PEP Advisory Committees which advise on the detailed allocation of funds for TAFE college courses and for courses provided by community groups. Funds for PEP (TAFE) Projects of National Significance are allocated and approved by the Minister's delegate after proposals have been invited.

      <para>
       Mr D. L. Price was sued in defamation over the contents of a report he provided to the Aboriginal Development Commission in his capacity as an independent professional consultant. Mr Price settled out of court and sought financial assistance from the Commission to meet his legal expenses.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Commission is being sued in defamation by a different plaintiff over the contents of a press release (September 1981) and a letter in the same month to the newspaper, the Adelaide Advertiser. The Commission is defending the action.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Yes.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) It is the Commission's view that the costs were incurred by Mr Price in his capacity as an independent professional consultant. Accordingly the Commission does not have an obligation to Mr Price in this matter and consequently does not have the power to assist him under the Aboriginal Development Commission Act 1980.
      </para>

       (4) The Commission is an independent statutory authority and is not subject to specific direction by Government on operational decisions taken in the exercise of its statutory powers.

        —The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) The Province of Taiwan (Taiwan) was in 1984/85 our sixth most important trading partner and a valuable market for a number of Australian raw materials and agricultural products. I am aware of the high level of commercial interest in the market. Following representations to me from the private sector on matters concerning the trade and commercial relationship with Taiwan, an Interdepartmental Committee was convened. See (5) below.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) In December 1972, Australia recognised the People's Republic of China as the sole legitimate Government of China, including Taiwan. The Australian Government affords no recognition to the authorities in Taiwan and there is no Trade Commissioner based there. Assistance is available to companies to develop trade from the Australian Chamber of Commerce and its office in Taipei.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) Strong growth rates in two way trade have been recorded in recent years reflecting a growing penetration of the Australian market by Taiwan and an expanding demand for Australian raw materials to support the development of Taiwan's industrial base. In 1984/85 Australian exports to Taiwan were valued at $856 million and imports from Taiwan were valued at $1,053 million.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) No. However, information available to the Department of Trade on economic developments in Taiwan suggests that the outlook for continued growth in this economy is promising. The Australian Chamber of Commerce, through its office in Taipei, has undertaken studies on the market in Taiwan for a variety of products. These reports are available from the Australian Chamber of Commerce in Canberra.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) Yes. The Committee was established to review various aspects of Australia's relationship with Taiwan, including the commercial relationship. The Committee was not required to make specific recommendations although a focus of activity has been the streamlining of visa issuing procedures for applications from Taiwan.

       Testing centres are located in each of the capital cities at Service establishments or in Defence Force Recruiting Centres. Testing is also undertaken at Townsville and Army Reserve local testing for country applicants may be undertaken by visiting teams or by local civilian medical practitioners.
      </para>

      </para>
      <para>
       (3) The waiting time varies between the three Services. For Army it is around two to three weeks. For RAAF, testing is arranged on average about 5 to 6 weeks after receipt of the application by the Defence Force Recruiting Centre. For Navy the period varies considerably from State to State and depending on the type of entry, but 5 to 6 weeks would be average for sailors; direct officer entry would normally be longer because of the need to convene selection boards.

       (10) The ACTU advises that the trip was most successful as it provided an opportunity to meet a cross-section of the South African community and assess the needs for training for black trade unionists. As a result of the visit the ACTU invited COSATU to send a delegation to Australia to inspect and discuss trade union training facilities. In early June three COSATU officials came to Australia and examined ACTU training facilities with a view to reporting back to the COSATU Executive in RSA prior to presenting the ACTU with a proposal for an ACTU administered training program for black South African trade unionists.

       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) I do not consider that the present laws on warning labels require amendment. These laws cover a number of different areas but particularly Health(e.g. poisons labelling) and Consumer Affaires (e.g. labels warning of the inhalation hazard posed by beanbag filling) and are generally embodied in State/ Territory legislation. There are a number of Commonwealth/State/Territory consultative mechanisms which have made substantial progress in developing adequate and uniform requirements for hazardous ingredient labelling.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Office of Consumer Affairs within my Department assists in the co-ordination of these efforts from the consumer viewpoint. Consumer protection legislation at the Commonwealth and State/Territory levels provides powers to require specific warnings on consumer goods where deemed necessary.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) As indicated in (1), hazardous ingredient labelling is controlled under a variety of legislation which is usually specific to the product type. Such legislation is complemented by Commonwealth, State and Territory consumer protection legislation under which warning labels, including ingredient warning labels, can be introduced if particular needs are identified. I do not consider it necessary to request the Australian Law Reform Commission to examine the law on this area.

       (1) Although my attention has been drawn to recent US proposals to restrict the use of methylene chloride in aerosol containers, my Department is not aware of any valid studies linking methylene chloride with cancer in humans.

       (2) and (3) The Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission has been concerned about low retention rates to upper secondary schooling in south-western and western Sydney for some years. In June 1983 it established a Working Party to examine the higher education needs of the outer metropolitan areas of Sydney and Melbourne with low levels of participation. The Working Party's report (Commonwealth Tertiary Education Commission, Report of the Working Party on Outer Metropolitan Areas, November 1983) drew attention to the below average school retention rates in both outer Sydney and outer Melbourne. The Report indicated that higher education institutions should consider ways of being involved in the operations of schools to encourage improved school-leaver participation in their programs. In its Volume 1 Report for the 1985-87 Triennium (April 1984), the Commission noted the ``disturbingly low'' school retention rates in outer metropolitan and rural areas and drew attention to the need to increase school retention in order to reduce educational disadvantage. Its recommendations for growth in higher education enrolments over the 1985-87 triennium were made on the basis that a large part of the expansion should take place in the institutions serving outer metropolitan areas-in the case of Sydney at Macarthur Institute of Higher Education, Nepean College of Advanced Education and Macquarie University.

       On the matter of bush end failures, the Federal Office of Road Safety is of the view that failures which may affect the safety of the vehicle are principally a result of inadequate maintenance of the affected parts. Agreement has been reached with the suspension supplier that revised maintenance procedure material will be disseminated and training sessions with truck dealers and workshop personnel conducted. This action has been commenced and will be monitored by the Federal Office of Road Safety.
      </para>
      <para>
       A detailed investigation of beam failures has resulted in 22 failures being documented. The majority of these failures have been of beams which have the lowest rating. These have been frequently fitted to trucks which have been working in arduous conditions where overloading is common. Investigations are continuing but overloading appears to be a significant factor. The suspension supplier some time ago ceased supplying beams of this rating to the industry.

A Federal Office of Road Safety (FORS) investigation has involved discussions between the manufacturer, State and Territory authorities, individual truck owners and an industry association.

      <para>
       The question refers to a Ministerial appointment to a senior advisory position. To answer all parts of the question as asked would entail intrusion into the privacy of individuals and would also impose a considerable workload upon officers. I will therefore respond to what I perceive to be the essence of the question, rather than deal with all twenty-three component parts.
      </para>
      <para>
       I was advised late last year that Mr Paul Hughes, the then Chairman of the NAEC, would vacate the position before the end of the year instead of serving out his full remaining term of office to 1 May, 1986.
      </para>
      <para>
       Although the position is a ministerial appointment, not a public service position to be filled through the normal process of competition, applications were invited through an advertisement on 26 October 1985 in The Australian. An advisory panel was formed to consider all applications and give me their advice. Membership of the panel was agreed between my Department, the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, and the Chairman of the NAEC, and consisted of: Mr P. Bowler, First Assistant Secretary, Education Programs and Research Division, Department of Education (chairman of panel); Mr D. O'Rourke, First Assistant Secretary, Program Development Division, Department of Aboriginal Affairs; Mr P. Hughes, Chairman of the NAEC; and Ms Josie Crawshaw, Director, Aboriginal Development Branch of the Northern Territory Public Service Board, and a member of the NAEC.
      </para>
      <para>
       In view of the relatively short time before the position became vacant (Mr Hughes left on 13 December), and the particular need for continuity at a time when several important developments in Aboriginal education were under way, I instructed my Department to proceed without any delay in the consideration of applications. Two had been received by the closing date of 8 November 1985, and a further two had been received by 20 November, when the advisory panel first met to conduct interviews. Arrangements were made to interview three of the applicants in person in Canberra, and the fourth, who was unavailable to come to Canberra at short notice, by telephone. A fifth application was received too late for consideration.
      </para>
      <para>
       The panel reported to me on 3 December on the outcome of their deliberations, in which they were guided by the selection criteria set out hereunder. After considering the panel's advice and consulting Ministerial colleagues I decided on 10 December 1985 to appoint Mr Errol West, the then Deputy Chairman of the NAEC, to the position of Chairman. I announced the appointment on 11 December 1985.
      </para>

       I should add that, in addition to advertising the vacancy in The Australian, copies of the advertisement were sent to State and Territory Aboriginal Consultative Groups immediately after it appeared.

       (2) Under the Local Government (Personal Income Tax Sharing) Act, the Federal Government had little control over the methods by which Local Government was allocated Federal general revenue assistance. The Act established in only very broad terms the method by which funds were to be distributed.
      </para>
      <para>
       However, under the Local Government (Financial Assistance) Act 1986, which came into operation on 1 July 1986, the States are required by 1 July 1987 to formulate principles upon which they propose to distribute Federal general revenue assistance between councils. These principles are to be based on the objective of equalising each Local Government's ability to undertake its functions with respect to the average standard performance of other Local Governments in its State. I, as the responsible Minister, will be required to approve these principles.
      </para>
      <para>
       The intention is to ensure that financial assistance is given to those local councils who are most disadvantaged in respect of their ability to raise revenue and provide services.

       All other Commonwealth grants to Local Government are for specific purposes. They are administered through a variety of arrangements. The amount of direct Commonwealth control varies with the nature of these programs, however all are intended to be directed towards the areas of greatest need that the programs are addressing.

       (2) The Australian Institute of Health is currently undertaking a number of projects designed to look at a variety of health issues, especially the application of economics to health and health services research. In this respect, two projects have particular relevance to the honourable member's question. Findings from the two projects when combined will give some measure of the overall prescribing and medicine usage patterns of the Australian public, including aged persons who are eligible or ineligible to receive free medicines under the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.
      </para>
      <para>
       The first project involved a recently completed household medication survey in Sydney, Melbourne, Wynyard/Burnie and Mt Gambier. The study was designed to measure the amounts and types of medications held, and used, in the household. It also sought to determine the ratio of prescribed to non-prescribed medicines and attempted to link medicine ownership and usage to the three types of basic classification of pensioner concessional beneficiary and general recipient.
      </para>
      <para>
       Data from the survey have now been received by the Institute of Health and will shortly be analysed.
      </para>
      <para>
       The second project involved the collating of all pharmaceutical benefits prescription drugs dispensed in the second quarter of 1985, and attributed to the population residing in two study regions (Wynyard/Burnie and Mt Gambier). The basic data from the project are available for analysis. It is intended to move on to measure the pharmaceutical benefits prescription drug usage and cost by individuals (age and sex) and by households (family economic units). As well, the extent of non-users of pharmaceutical benefits prescription drugs will be measured.
      </para>
      <para>
       Further analysis of the two projects will provide meaningful information relative to the whole population of Australia. Considerable time and effort were expended in selecting the two study regions to enable this, and the Australian Institute of Health will be studying the data for some time to come.

      <para>
       As stated in my answer to question No. 3410, a check on importation of fresh brie and camembert from the Besnier Export Company of France was undertaken by my Department. A list of all cheese of these types originating from Besnier was prepared and forwarded to the Department of Health for appropriate action.
      </para>
      <para>
       This list was prepared on the basis that, although the specific brand of cheese which caused the problem in the USA was not imported to Australia, there was a definite possibility that the specific cheese could be imported into Australia under a different brand name.
      </para>
      <para>
       Advice from the Besnier Company has now confirmed that cheeses exported to Australia originate from two factories which also supply for the American market.

       (3) Britain remains one of Australia's major trading partners. Australian exports to Britain in 1984/85 amounted to $923 million making this our most important market in Europe. Britain is our sixth most important market world wide taking 3.0% of Australia's total exports. In the 9 months ended March 1986, Australian exports to Britain have increased 43.1% over the same period to March 1985. However, the nature of our trade has changed considerably since Britain gained EC membership in 1973 and Australia lost its preferential market access. While Britain still offers a valuable market for wool and significant sales of meat, fruit, cheese and a few other agricultural products still take place, the dominance of agricultural products in Australia's exports to Britain has been replaced by minerals, metals and fuels.
      </para>
      <para>
       Britain is also one of Australia's most important customers for manufactures. Australian exports of elaborately transformed manufactures have been undergoing steady growth in recent years and now comprise nearly 21% of our total exports to Britain.

      <para>
       The Australian Trade Commission recognises the continuing importance of the UK as an export market for Australia and the considerable potential for further development of the UK as a market for exports of manufactured products, particularly elaborately transformed manufactures.

      <para>
       (2) The so called `pricing errors' stem from problems identified by US authorities involved with calculation of the total pool of costs to be recovered and with the reassessment of production run quantities of some defence equipments. The reassessment highlighted lesser numbers than those used to determine recoveries of nonrecurring costs. The article referred to is a media interpretation of March 1986 hearings before the US Congressional Committee on Government Operations. The dollars billion quoted in the article are in fact dollars million. Furthermore the US Department of Defense is currently reviewing the method of calculating Research and Development costs for recovery but advises that irrespective of whether any changes emerge there will not be any retroactive billing of the Australian Government.

       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) There are six companies who market forty-six (46) different oral contraceptive preparations in Australia. The vast majority of these have been evaluated and approved by the Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC). In addition I am aware that Depo-Provera, an injectable preparation containing medroxyprogesterone acetate, is being used in certain circumstances as a contraceptive agent although this is not one of the purposes for which it is marketed in Australia.
      </para>
      <para>
       The following intra-uterine devices are currently available in Australia: Nova-T, Gyne-T, Gravigard, Mini-Gravigard and Multiload CU250. These were all evaluated and approved by the ADEC for safety and efficacy. The Lippes Loop was also available until January 1986 when the Company ceased distribution although there could well be some stocks of this device still available.
      </para>
      <para>
       There is in addition a very wide range of condoms and a small range of diaphragms also available in Australia. It is not possible to list all of these although this information is currently being sought for inclusion on the National Register of Therapeutic Goods being compiled by my Department.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Of all the drugs and devices presently available in Australia the only ones which I am aware have been withdrawn in the U.S. are the Lippes Loop and the Gravigard I.U.D. The Company manufacturing the Lippes Loop has stated that it has ceased manufacture in the U.S. because of falling sales in favour of the Copper I.U.D.s. The Gravigard was removed from the market because of the continuing litigation climate which prevails in the U.S. The Company producing the Gravigard has stated it was no longer able to obtain liability insurance cover in respect of the device. This was a voluntary withdrawal by the Company and was not as a result of any regulatory action by the Food and Drug Administration.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) The Lippes Loop will in due course no longer be available in Australia as the Company has ceased production. No action has been taken to withdraw the Gravigard from the Australian market as there is no evidence available to my Department that this device is a cause of serious problems in those women who are using it as a means of contraception. This device has only been withdrawn from the market in the U.S. and is still available in many other countries throughout the world, including the United Kingdom.

      <para>
       (1) Yes. Auscott Ltd announced on 13 May 1986 that it would reduce its cotton plantings for the 1986-87 crop year by at least 50%. Auscott indicated that its decision was made necessary by reduced returns for cotton resulting from the severe price depresssing effects of the new United States cotton program.

      <para>
       (2) Approximately 8%.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) Yes. The Bureau of Agricultural Economics has forecast a reduction in cotton plantings in Australia of some 25% in 1986-87.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) Recent sharp falls in world cotton prices are a direct consequence of high world stocks, aggravated by the new US cotton program with its substantial Payment-in-kind stock releases. Little can be done about the overall stock situation, however, the Government will continue to press on the US authorities the serious consequences which its cotton support program will have on returns to the Australian cotton industry with a view to minimising its effects. An important part of my recent visit to Washington was to reiterate Australia's concerns about US farm support programs, including the one for cotton, to the US Secretary of Agriculture and other key officials.
      </para>
      <para>
       At home, the cotton industry is examining the possibility of seeking some form of price assistance. If the industry decides to pursue this course, it may be assured that any submission requesting assistance will be given speedy consideration by the Government. The Bureau of Agricultural Economics is currently undertaking a study of financial conditions in the cotton industry, the results of which will assist the Government's assessment of the industry's problems and provide important information for the industry.
      </para>
      <para>
       Farmers in difficulty may seek assistance through the Rural Adjustment Scheme. Cotton production requires relatively high levels of capital, and cotton growers seeking assistance will benefit from the Government's decision to allocate a further $20 million for interest subsidies through the Scheme in 1986-87 to assist debt reconstruction, farm build-up and farm improvement.
      </para>

       (5) Yes. Domestic prices have declined by about 12% and export prices have declined by about 8%.
      </para>
      <para>
       (6) Australian cotton prices are expected to follow the trend in world prices. The main world price indicator, the Cotton Outlook (`A index'), is currently US39c/lb (A59c/lb) and is expected to fall further after 1 August 1986 when US cotton stocks are due to be released onto the world market under the new US cotton program.

       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) My Department provided estimates to the National Drug Summit indicating that 16,620 Australians died in 1983 as a result of diseases attributable to use of tobacco. These figures were estimated from data supplied by the Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) using indices described by Drew (L. R. H. Drew, Death and Drug Use in Australia, 1969 to 1980, Technical Information Bulletin 69, pp. 1-44). The figures were incorporated in an information document by my Department, `Statistics on Drug Abuse in Australia', for use in association with the Special Premiers' Conference held in April 1985.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) The precise reference in the conclusions of the 1977 Report of the Senate Standing Committee on Social Welfare was that . . .`there is an overwhelming weight of evidence that tobacco causes ill health. Perhaps 10 per cent of all deaths are attributable to it' (p. 103). No information was given of the methodology used in arriving at this figure.
      </para>
      <para>
       However, since 1982, the methodology developed by Dr L. R. H. Drew has been applied to mortality data supplied by the ABS for the determination of deaths attributable to the use of a particular drug. Using this methodology my Department estimated the number of deaths attributable to tobacco use. When this method is applied to the mortality data for 1977, the estimate of deaths attributable to tobacco is 14.7% of all deaths.

      <para>
       (1) (2) (3) and (6) The Commonwealth, Victorian and Tasmanian Governments announced the introduction of new management arrangements for the Bass Strait scallop fishery on 6 June 1986.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Ministers announced in conjunction with these arrangements the implementation of the Offshore Constitutional Settlement (OCS) for the scallop and tuna fisheries. The two States had requested a delay in opening of the scallop fishery until the OCS was implemented. The change in fisheries jurisdiction under the OCS involved detailed negotiations with the States and industry and preparation of complex technical and legal documents. Implementation of the OCS for scallops was complicated further by the Victorian Government's review of fisheries licensing arrangements.
      </para>
      <para>
       Under the new arrangements the areas generally within 20 nautical miles of each State as defined by the base lines will be managed as State fisheries by each State Government. The remainder of the fishery or the Central Zone will be managed with the joint agreement of the Victorian and Tasmanian Governments. This zone will continue to be administered under Commonwealth law with both States accepting responsibility for the cost of management and the surveillance of this zone. The Commonwealth, at the request of both States reopened the Central zone on 12 June.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) (5) and (8) The Commonwealth fully consulted the Victorian and Tasmanian Governments and the industry from each State before proceeding to implement the new arrangements in the Bass Strait scallop fishery.
      </para>
      <para>
       Port meetings with the industry were conducted in October 1984.
      </para>
      <para>
       From June 1984 the main avenue for industry consultation was through the six industry representatives on the nine member Bass Strait Scallop Task Force.
      </para>
      <para>
       In June 1985 the 20 nautical mile State fisheries zones were proposed by the States and industry representatives on the Task Force. The Task Force recommended at that time that access to the State Zones be limited to those vessels with State scallop licences. In July 1985, Commonwealth and State Ministers meeting in the Australian Fisheries Council accepted the Task Force Recommendations.
      </para>
      <para>
       (7) State fisheries authorities act as agents for the Commonwealth in the issue of Commonwealth Fishing boat Licences. Commonwealth licences are issued annually and the actual date of issue is dependent upon the date of receipt of each application and the time required to process those applications. Licences are usually issued by Victoria during April and May each year and licences usually issued by Tasmania in February and March each year. It is understood that there have been unforeseen administrative delays in issuing licences in each State. These delays are being overcome and all licences should be issued shortly.

       </para>

      <para>
       Australia's waterfront operations appear in many cases to be less efficient and productive than comparable port and terminal operations abroad.
      </para>
      <para>
       In recognition of the importance of transport and handling costs in Australia's export and import trades, my colleague the Honourable Peter Morris, Minister for Transport, established in September 1984 a Task Force on Shore-Based Shipping Costs to examine and report on means for reducing costs and removing bottlenecks in the shore-based industry.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Task Force is expected to finalise its report shortly. Its two interim reports have identified a large array of problem areas.
      </para>
      <para>
       It is difficult to measure to cost impact of current waterfront productivity levels on imports and exports with any accuracy. The bulk of these costs are met by shipping companies and are included in sea freight rates. They are not separately charged or identified in the customer's bill. However, the proportion of door to door costs attributable to shore-based operations both here and overseas is estimated to be in the order of 50 per cent and rising to 70 per cent in some instances. Given a total bill for shipping Australia's bulk and liner imports and exports of about $6 billion in 1984-85, shore based costs could account for over $3 billion. For containerised liner export cargo, the total cost of transport and handling, from exporter's premises to ship, has been estimated at $230 million annually.
      </para>
      <para>
       In the Prime Minister's economic statement which accompanied his recent Address to the Nation, the Prime Minister referred to a number of reports on transport and handling costs and the need to examine them in an integrated way to identify action to remove impediments to trade. It is expected that the Government will be looking closely at waterfront costs as part of that examination.

        —The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) The Government appreciates that the fringe bene-fits tax could adversely affect a number of local governments and that local governments in more isolated areas may be particularly disadvantaged. However, a tax of this nature universally affect all sectors of government and business community, and makes a case for special exemptions difficult to argue.
      </para>
      <para>
       As you would be aware, recent amendments to the proposed fringe benefits tax legislation have significantly reduced the amount of tax payable for the private component of motor vehicle use and for subsidised travel and housing in remote areas. Local Government, particularly in isolated areas will benefits greatly from these changes.
      </para>
      <para>
       Meanwhile, to the extent that the fringe benefits tax imposes a disability on individual councils, particularly isolated councils, I would expect that such disabilities would be fully taken into account by State Local Government Grants Commissions in assessing allocations of Commonwealth general purpose financial assistance.
      </para>
      <para>
       Because of the importance of this tax to isolated councils I have asked my Department to keep under review the effects of its implementation on councils.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Further to the answer to (1), legislation passed in the Autumn session, the Local Government (Financial Assistance) Act, will allow Commonwealth general purpose funds for Local Government to be increased in 1986-87 and 1987-88 either to maintain the same real terms or to equal the percentage increase in general financial assistance being provided to the States. The formula chosen will be that which provides the best result for Local Government.
      </para>
      <para>
       As a consequence of decisions made on the level of general purpose assistance to the States at the June 1986 Premiers' Conference, Local Government will receive the same real terms funds in 1986-87 as it did in 1985-86. In comparison, grants to the States will decrease by 1.7% in real terms.
      </para>

        —Based on advice provided by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC) the answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) The staff strength of the ABC was:

       6405-30 June 1980

      <para>
       6801-30 June 1984
      </para>
      <para>
       (a) During the period 1980-1984 staff increased in a wide range of areas to implement new projects, policies and procedures. For example, extra staff were needed to carry out the requirements of the Freedom of Information Act, the Archives Act, Grievance Appeals Procedures, Equal Opportunity Policies and Community Affairs procedures; ABC Enterprise expanded its activities and additional staff were engaged for ABC Shops in all States; the expansion of Aboriginal Broadcasting required staff to be assigned to training and co-ordination activities; strong emphasis was placed on forward planning-the Second Regional Radio Network and the introduction of the AUSSAT system, as well as prep- aration of the ABC's first Corporate Plan, EDP Plan and Property Plan.
      </para>
      <para>
       In summary, the breakdown by Division of the additional 378 staff is:

      </para>
      <para>
       (b) The increase in staff must be seen against the background of the capital run-down of the ABC over many years. Only from the year ending 30 June, 1985 has ABC capital expenditure as a proportion of total ABC expenditure begun to rise appreciably, as a result of decisions taken by the new Corporation Board and Management. The greater productivity and thereby savings in staff costs were first evidenced in the substantial reduction of permanent staff numbers resulting from the 1985 voluntary redundancy package.
      </para>
      <para>
       Once the ABC's satellite services are fully operational, there will be staff savings in the transmission area. Some staff in the area have already taken advantage of the voluntary redundancy package.
      </para>
      <para>
       Other new technology, such as computerisation, is not yet resulting in significant staff savings because staff are required to design and install the new information management systems within which the technology will be used. Further, extensive training of staff is required so that the new systems will operate effectively. However, in future years staff savings will begin to appear in administrative areas, such as the savings that will be achieved as a result of the introduction of the computerised Assets register. Labour-saving technology is not so applicable to program production and this will continue to be a labour-intensive area of activity.

       It is not readily ascertainable as to the amounts of capital expenditure directly resulting in reduced labour costs. However, an indication of the shift in emphasis by the Corporation to be more capital intensive is shown by the levels of capital expenditure per employee:

       Telecom is unable to provide the exact amounts spent each year on Australian manufactured goods. However, approximately 90% of materials and services are obtained from Australian manufacturers.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) In its report of 5 October 1984 on ``Telecommunications and Related Equipment and Parts'' the Industries Assistance Commission (IAC) stated that approximately 9 000 people were employed in industry covering the goods then under reference. However, it should be noted that the IAC inquiry did not embrace cable, power supply equipment and motor vehicles and similar items, of which Telecom makes significant purchases.
      </para>
      <para>
       It has also been estimated that Telecom's purchases represent 75% of the output of local manufacturers engaged in the Australian telecommunications industry.

       (4) Telecom is unable to provide the estimated private enterprise employment multiplier for capital works expenditure. The Department of Industry, Technology and Commerce (DITAC) has advised the Department of Communications that neither it nor the Bureau of Industry Economics has calculated multiplier for the Australian communications equipment industry, nor are they aware of any Australian studies on the subject.

       (1) Information is detailed in Table 1.

       (2) Information is detailed in Table 2.

      <para>
       (5) and (6) The projects funded by my Department as direct grants in the Electoral Division of Richmond in 1983-84 and 1984-85 are listed in Table 3. I am not prepared to authorise the use of considerable resources of time and money that would be involved in providing information on projects funded in 1982-83 or on projects funded through programs of my portfolio organisations. All Departmental grants are evaluated each year against their stated goals and objectives. This is a prerequisite for consideration of continuing funding in the succeeding year.
      </para>
      <para>
       (7) and (8) As has been the practice adopted by previous governments, I am not prepared to authorise the commitment of substantial resources to the collection and collation of this information.
      </para>
      <para>
       (9) The per capita funding in the selected electoral divisions is provided in Table 4. This is limited to Departmental direct grants from 1983-84 onwards for the reasons given in response to sections (5) and (6) above. The electoral populations are taken from the 1981 Census.
      </para>
      <para>
       (10), (11), (12) and (13) Applications for grants are developed in consultation with Aboriginal communities and organisations. This is accomplished by Area Office staff who consult with Aboriginal people to ascertain their outstanding needs, relative priorities and the available options to overcome them. The Area Office disseminates information about available services and programs to local Aboriginal communities. No specific advertising has been undertaken in Richmond, nor will it be, since information about services and programs currently reaches the Aboriginal communities entitled to receive them in the most cost effective manner.

      <para>
       (d) Over 200 applications were received from New South Wales seeking funding in excess of $9m. Only $1.5m was available in the State under the Program. This project did not receive the very high priority required for it to be funded because the proposed work will be carried out, in part, with the $30,000 made available under the Program in 1985-86 for a secretariat. The Commonwealth Government is also assisting NOROC through its Interchange Program in that the Secretary to the Organisation is a Commonwealth employee on interchange.

       (c) $55,000.
      </para>
      <para>
       (d) See (i) (d) above. This project did not receive the very high priority required for it to be funded because the project cost as proposed was considered rather high for the work to be undertaken and the trail project anticipates earning significant income, hence such work could be funded from borrowings to be recouped once the work is completed.
      </para>
      <para>
       (iii) (a) Identify and investigate koala habitats within the City of Lismore and design and implement programs to expand existing habitat areas.

       (c) $23,000.
      </para>
      <para>
       (d) See (i) (d) above. This project did not receive the very high priority for funding because the study was marginal in terms of the Program guidelines. Priority under the Program is given to more mainstream activities of Local Government which produce results which can be applied by the broadest possible range of councils.
      </para>
      <para>
       (iv) (a) Develop a training strategy for the elected members and employees of Lismore City Council. The project proposed to assess needs and develop the necessary training programs.

       (b) Lismore City Council.

       (c) $22,000.
      </para>
      <para>
       (d) See (i) (d) above. This project did not receive the very high priority required for it to be funded because considerable advice and some courses for this purpose are already available through the Local Government Industry Training Committees. Extension of these courses is presently being undertaken by Penrith City Council. As my Department has indicated in its recent letter to Lismore City Council, it would be pleased to provide details of such work under the Program to Council should it wish to follow this matter up.

       (c) $25,000
      </para>
      <para>
       (d)  See (i) (d) above. This project did not receive the very high priority required for it to be funded because extensive work on small scale sewerage treatment work has already been completed under the Program during 1983-84 and 1984-85. The nature of projects supported is such that the results obtained can be applied by many councils. My Department indicated in its recent letter to the Council (Tweed), that it would be pleased to provide details of this work if Council wishes.

      <para>
       (d)  See (i) (d) above. This project did not receive the very high priority required for it to be funded because extensive work on tourism development strategies, facilities needs, project design and model project implementation has been undertaken through the Program in 1983-84 and 1984-85. Tweed Shire Council has been invited to make use of this existing work in my Department's recent letter.
      </para>
      <para>
       (9) Data are not maintained on an electorate basis and it would be most difficult to provide comparable information. Local Government authority boundaries rarely, if ever, coincide with Commonwealth electorate boundaries and many projects are nation, State or region-wide. Priority is given under the Program for projects which develop models and methodologies which have broad applicability throughout Local Government.
      </para>
      <para>
       The task would involve questionable judgments about the distribution of benefits of projects. Given the expected unreliability of the result I have decided that the considerable time and cost of undertaking the task is not warranted.
      </para>
      <para>
       (10) In 1983-84, the Program was a small one of $1.65m only and commenced on a pilot basis in the needy regions of Western Sydney and Western and North Western Melbourne. Applications were encouraged from Local Government bodies and associated agencies in those regions.
      </para>
      <para>
       In 1984-85, the Program was extended to all States and the Northern Territory and targeted regions were selected in consultation with the State and Northern Territory Governments. Applications dealing with local housing assessment, training, research and information were accepted from throughout Australia.
      </para>
      <para>
       In 1985-86, the Program became the fully fledged Local Government Development Program and guidelines, application forms and publicity material were sent in September/October 1985 to every Local Government authority and regional groupings of such authorities in Australia.
      </para>
      <para>
       (11) Individual residents are not eligible for grants under the Local Government Development Program. However, I issued a media release on 10 September 1985 about the Program which was circulated to regional and local media.
      </para>
      <para>
       My Department produces a booklet titled ``Commonwealth Assistance for Local Projects'' which contains details of Commonwealth assistance for projects at the local level, including under the Local Government Development Program. Booklets for the 1984-85 and 1985-1986 financial years were distributed very widely including to all Local Government authorities.
      </para>
      <para>
       (12) Information concerning grant availability and eligibility will continue to be drawn to the attention of all Local Government bodies throughout Australia. It is not intended to arrange public advertising of the Local Government Development Program, since members of the general public are not eligible for funding under the Program.
      </para>
      <para>
       (13) Information on grant availability and eligibility for future Programs will be provided to all Local Government authorities by direct mail, in sufficient time to enable them to apply for assistance.

        —The answer to the honourable member's question, based in part on information provided by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation, is:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) The honourable member's question asks specifically about censorship standards and their relationship to the ABC. The matter of censorship is properly viewed as an integral part of a broader process of assessment and classification. I do not consider that it is a particularly useful approach to single out the censorship aspect of the process and the remainder of this answer is predicated on the principles involved in program standards.
      </para>
      <para>
       Under Section 6 (1) (a) of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation Act 1983 (the ABC Act) the ABC is required to ``provide within Australia innovative and comprehensive broadcasting and television services of a high standard.'' Section 6 (2) (a) (iii) of the ABC Act also provides that the ``Corporation shall take account of . . . the standards from time to time approved by the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal in respect of broadcasting and television services''.
      </para>
      <para>
       Under Section 118 of the Broadcasting Act 1942, the ABC is prohibited from broadcasting ``matter which is blasphemous, indecent or obscene.''
      </para>
      <para>
       The ABC has also produced the document, ``Program Policies and Practices for ABC Radio and Television'' for the guidance of staff. A revised edition of this document is now in preparation.
      </para>
      <para>
       For locally-produced material, production departments are required to refer the product to the appropriate officers within the ABC where doubt exists as to the classification of a program.

      <para>
       (2) The censorship standards that apply to the ABC remain as they have been over the past 5 years.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) As an independent statutory authority, the ABC has the responsibility for determining its programming policies and practices in accordance with the legislative provisions detailed in part (1) of this answer.
      </para>
      <para>
       Commercial licensees are required by Section 99 (1) of the Broadcasting Act 1942 to ensure that ``as far as practicable, the programs are in accordance with standards determined by the Tribunal''. The ABC is required by section 6 (2) (a) (ii) of the ABC Act to take account of those standards. While the ABC advises that it very largely observes the ABT's standards, it is not limited by them. In fact, the ABC's charter bestows on the Corporation considerable scope in the choice of programs for broadcast as well as the responsibility for ensuring that the programs are of a ``high standard''.
      </para>
      <para>
       All broadcasters are subject to the prohibition on the broadcasting of blasphemous, indecent or obscene matter. This is provided for in Section 118 of the Broadcasting Act.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) People who wish to complain about a particular radio or television program may write to the ABC. Assertions of minor infringements are referred to the appropriate executive. Where there are more serious accusations or where a complainant is dissatisfied with the ABC's response, the matter is referred to the senior executive of the ABC Department concerned. In extreme cases the senior executive may decide that a case warrants notification to the Managing Director for advice. It is usual that a response, generally from the appropriate senior program executive, is made to the complainant.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) and (6) Complaints in relation to censorship vary greatly from questions of taste in the use of language, in the presentation of social issues in comedy programs, to questions of law as to whether a program was indecent or obscene. These complaints are addressed variously to the ABC's Head Office, its State branches or to the program makers themselves. There is no index or other system available to retrieve these specific types of complaints from the very large volume of audience correspondence the ABC receives, other than a long and expensive manual search of all corporate, State, program department and archival files.
      </para>
      <para>
       (7) The action taken to deal with the complaints would always include at a minimum the forwarding of the complaint to the head of the department responsible for the program for reply to the complainant. In more serious cases, if the circumstances warranted, an apology may be made and action taken to avoid repetition.
      </para>
      <para>
       As indicated at point 4 there is provision by the ABC for complaints of major significance to be processed and dealt with at the highest executive level.
      </para>
      <para>
       (8) There are a number of legislative provisions relating to program standards which the ABC is required to comply with or to take account of. The Government believes that this legislative framework, together with the ABC's own internal program policies and practices as noted in points 4 and 7, provides an adequate basis for ABC's programs to conform to community standards and expectations.

      </talk.start>
      <para>
       Under Section 94 (2) (g) of the Telecommunications Act 1975, a person may install and operate a communications installation on his own land. This authorisation extends to the cabling of premises. However, if the cabling is to be connected to and become part of the public telecommunications network, Telecom has extensive powers under the Act to require the cabling of premises to meet technical and other conditions, and to undertake such cabling itself.
      </para>
      <para>
       Cabling of premises for telecommunication services is best considered in terms of:
      </para>
      <para>
       (a) Private property cabling
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) main building cabling.
      </para>
      <para>
       In relation to (a), Telecom allows major cabling projects and projects in remote areas, on a case by case basis, to be undertaken by the property owner or a competent contractor on his behalf.
      </para>
      <para>
       In relation to (b), for premises such as large commercial, industrial or residential buildings or complexes which require a permanent cabling system for the reticulation of telecommunications services, Telecom's current policy provides that the building be cabled on behalf of the owner by Telecom or by cabling contractors empowered by Telecom.

       (1) No supplementary licences or new independent licences have been granted as a result of the Supplementary Licence Scheme.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Supplementary Licence Scheme was proposed by the previous Government and then later endorsed by this Government. Unfortunately, the Scheme has proved to be complex and quite unproductive in terms of new services. In my statement to the House of 20 May 1986 I announced the Government's plans for expediting the introduction of additional commercial television services in regional areas. I also announced that provisions for supplementary television licences would be deleted from the Broadcasting Act 1942, but emphasised that this will not necessarily apply to the provisions for supplementary radio licences.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Some companies interested in applying for commercial radio licences have claimed that delays involved in the present procedures are making it difficult for them to maintain interest.

      <para>
       (1) Further to the answer given by his predecessor to question No. 5096 (Hansard, 21 October 1982, page 2479) stating that the United States does not release information as to the capacity of the reactors aboard its nuclear-powered warships, is this still the position of the United States Government; if not, what is its position.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) If the United States Government position is unchanged (a) what are the relevant Australian authorities referred to and (b) what are the specific sources used by these authorities to draw conclusions as to whether any given nuclear-powered warship exceeds the 100 MW limit in the absence of official advice from the Government responsible for the warship.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) Are the assessments made by the relevant authorities referred to accurate; if so, does this result in a lack of practical significance of the United States policy on October 1982 because independent accurate assessments can be made by nations such as Australia.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) If the assessments are not accurate what steps have been taken or will be taken to ensure that a reliable assessment can be made.

      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) It is still the policy of the United States Government to withhold information about the capacity of the nuclear reactors on its warships. I would draw to the honourable member's attention that the general conditions under which United States nuclear-powered warships (NPWs) are permitted to enter Australian ports were amended in late 1982 (Hansard, 8 December 1982, pp 3078-3079) following further assessment of information available on United States warships with reactors larger than 100 MW. Pursuant to this amendment it is no longer the case that vessels with reactors larger than 100 MW are excluded from the general conditions of entry, and the relevant Australian authorities are now required only to ensure that visiting NPW's are berthed in locations which comply with the strict environmental and safety regulations.

       As Minister for Transport I am responsible for, in addition to the Department of Transport, two statutory authorities, the Australian National Railways Commission (AN) and the Australian Shipping Commission (ANL). I am also responsible for administration of the Inter-State Commission Act 1975, which provides for the operation of the Inter-State Commission (ISC), an authority established by the Constitution.

       Both AN and ANL are required by legislation to operate as commercial business undertakings and both are in substantial competition with private sector operators. I am advised that AN and ANL consider that the information sought by the honourable member is of a commercially confidential nature and should not be disclosed to their competitors. I am therefore not prepared to authorise its disclosure.

       (8) See my answer to question without notice on `Australian Defence Force: Women' (Hansard, House of Representatives, 5 June 1986 pp 4664-5). The Defence Force is proposing to open a small number of aircrew positions to women in 1987 without significant detriment to the present male aircrew to aircraft ratio required to meet combat requirements should the need arise. The actual number of positions, which will be available on a merit basis, is still under consideration but it is expected they will include pilots, navigators and loadmasters.

      <para>
       (1) None. The South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty does not require any change in Australian policies towards other countries, including allies. On the contrary, the legal obligations it establishes are consistent with the policies of the Australian Government. That the Treaty also accords with the policy of other South Pacific Forum Member countries is indicated by the fact that it was collectively drafted and the text subsequently endorsed by the Forum and that ten of the thirteen Member countries of the Forum have already signed it.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) No changes have been made in the level of support given by Australia to other South Pacific nations. The SPNFZ Treaty explicitly upholds the sovereign right of each Party to decide for itself such questions as visits to its ports and airfields by foreign ships and aircraft. Transit rights for ships and aircraft in accordance with customary international law are fully respected by the Treaty.

       Yes. Racist slogans were adhered to some Australia Post street posting boxes in the Mount Dandenong Tourist Road area and in the Carlton South and Central Business District areas.

       (a) (b) and (c). I first became aware of this matter when the honourable member asked this question.
      </para>

       Police authorities advised Australia Post of the slogans in the Mount Dandenong Tourist Road area in October 1985. Police later charged two offenders with bill posting and their case was heard in the Ferntree Gully Magistrates Court on 22 May 1986. An Australia Post Officer was required to attend the Court to attest that there is no provision for any signs or posters, other than those of an official nature, to be affixed to street posting boxes. The offenders were found guilty and fined.
      </para>
      <para>
       When racist slogans were noticed on some street posting boxes in the Carlton South and Central Business District areas, an Australia Post representative contacted a member of National Action who advised that members of that group had become aware that it was illegal to place any slogan, other than that of an official nature, on a street posting box. Since that contact was made, no futher slogans have appeared.

        —The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) There are a total of approximately 28 clerical and engineering staff engaged in a variety of activities which relate, either directly or indirectly, to planning associated with the development of AM and FM radio services.
      </para>
      <para>
       Apart from staff involved in detailed planning related to the introduction of new licensed stations or to essential changes to the technical parameters of existing stations, appreciable resources are devoted to planning for the ABC's Second Regional Radio Network (SRRN) and functions such as the definition of service areas for all radio stations. To this list must be added such functions as the development of a National VHF Channel Allocation Plan, the related problem of clearing television services from Band II, and contributions to the Forward Development Unit's studies in relation to ``Future Directions for Commercial Radio''.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Yes. A number of engineering and other staff involved in the planning of individual stations elected not to move from Melbourne when decisions on relocation were taken in December 1984. In the interim, while some of these staff remained in Melbourne, every effort has been made to make full use of their experience and skills. Naturally, the loss of experienced planning staff and the need to recruit and train their replacements, has had an impact on the Department's capacity to plan new services in all sectors, not just in the area of AM and FM radio.
      </para>
      <para>
       On 20 May 1986, I informed the House that planning for the expansion of television services was my Department's highest priority, and that no new projects would be undertaken until planning for television equalisation was well advanced.
      </para>
      <para>
       Quite apart from delays related to the availability of planning resources, the introduction of new radio services in regional areas is, in many cases, very much constrained by the need to move television services from channels 3, 4 and 5 (collectively known as Band II) to new channels, so that channels for FM radio services can be made available. This is a complex and time consuming task.
      </para>
      <para>
       Delays to radio planning which result from the loss of Melbourne staff are unlikely to determine the opening dates of new services because, until the clearance of television services from Band II is well advanced, there will not be enough FM channels available to accommodate new radio services.
      </para>
      <para>
       Planning for the relocation of television services presently using channels 3, 4 and 5 is closely related to planning associated with television equalisation. Both tasks are given high priority and are thus being progressed in parallel.

       (b) The IDA-8 replenishment level is still under negotiation. The negotiations began in January 1986 and are expected to be finalised later this year.
      </para>
      <para>
       At the most recent IDA Deputies meeting in Washington on 7-8 April 1986 there was widespread support by virtually all delegates for an IDA-8 replenishment of $US12.0 billion.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) (a) As the United States is the major donor to IDA its attitude is crucial for the total level of a replenishment. For IDA-7 (fiscal years 1985-87) the United States indicated that it would not take up more than a 25 per cent share of the replenishment and would not contribute more than $US750 million per annum. This implied to other donors a maximum replenishment of $US9 billion. Other donors, including Australia, expressed disappointment at a possible $US9 billion replenishment, which they considered gravely inadequate, but in view of the pressing urgency to reach an agreement allowing the replenishment to start on 1 July 1984, they finally accepted a replenishment at this level.
      </para>
      <para>
       It should be noted that donors other than the United States established a Special Facility for Sub-Saharan African which subsequently reached $US1.4 billion. The United States later made a contribution to this Facility. Australia made an additional voluntary contribution of $A60 million to IDA-7 in lieu of contributing to the Special Facility, and in recognition of the needs of all IDA recipients for concessional resources.
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) As indicated, IDA-8 is under negotiation and no level has yet been agreed. However, many donors, including Australia, have indicated that they would prefer a higher replenishment figure than $US12 billion; they have coalesced around this figure because it represents the level to which it is hoped all donors, including the United States, might eventually agree to contribute reasonable shares.
      </para>
      <para>
       The United States initially considered IDA-8 should be $US9 to 12 billion but at the April 1986 IDA Deputies' meeting United States representatives were hopeful that the United States Government would be able to endorse a figure for IDA-8 in the $US10.5 to 12 billion range.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) Australia has supported an IDA-8 replenishment of $US12 billion given the continuing need of IDA recipients for concessional resources.
      </para>
      <para>
       Australia has been a longstanding, strong supporter of IDA, which it believes represents an efficient and effective disbursement channel for our overseas aid. IDA has a global focus on the poorest countries and seeks to improve production and incomes through careful project investments tailored to the recipient countries' needs.

      <para>
       (1) (a) I am not aware of any specific reports that quantify an increasing level of concern in the USA regarding inadequate health and safety warnings on household products. I am aware that there has been a general trend both in Australia and overseas for increased consumer information on hazardous products.
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) My Department regularly reviews decisions of the US Federal Government that relate to the control of hazardous chemicals which are reported in the Federal Register. My Department, however, rarely receives information relating to the regulations of individual US States that might differ from the Federal position. Consequently my Department is not aware that four of these States require chronic and acute hazard warning labelling.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) In relation to the introduction of similar warnings in Australia, the labelling of potentially hazardous chemicals is the responsibility of State and Territory authorities, usually under Poisons Legislation. For the past 30 years the National Health and Medical Research Council (NH &amp; MRC) Drugs and Poisons Schedule Committee (DPSC), consisting of representatives of all States, Territories and the Commonwealth has examined the hazard and consequent labelling requirements of many household chemicals. DPSC has consistently taken the view that the public is protected by the proper scheduling of such substances. The more hazardous a substance is, the more restrictive its scheduling. Associated with a more restrictive schedule are restrictions on availability, requirements for warning statements and relevant instructions on proper use.

       (1) A recent and important initiative taken by this Government has been the study by Mrs Sue Hamilton of the Office of the Status of Women, into the problems facing spouses of Australian Defence Force personnel. The report is the most comprehensive study undertaken in this area for many years and is intended as the first step in improving the quality of life of members of the Australian Defence Force.
      </para>

       Mrs Hamilton submitted her report on 30 April 1986 and the Government immediately set about implementing many of her recommendations. To this end, a small full-time secretariat has been established within my Department to provide a co-ordinated family support structure for all three services.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Government also recognizes that families of Service personnel are often disadvantaged because they lack the extended family and community support systems normally available to families. Where local civilian community facilities do not exist or are inadequate and there are suitable Defence facilities surplus to immediate Defence needs, I have asked that these be made available to house community activities.

      <para>
       (1) Yes; a new bill format has been introduced by Telecom under which customers getting the new bill for the first time will receive four pages and three pages thereafter.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) The decision to introduce a new billing system was made in recognition of customer requirements for a more informative and flexible billing facility and to take advantage of cost savings available with the use of modern technology. Overall, it is expected the new system will reduce administrative costs.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) Telecom recognises that costs for the supply of bill forms have increased but it is expected that these will be more than offset by savings through reduced consumption of computer paper used under the old billing system. At this early stage the precise impact in money terms in relation to additional paper costs, if any, has not been quantified.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) Telecom has received complaints from customers regarding the new format and structure of the bill but the level of complaints in comparison to the number of customers already converted from the old billing system does not suggest wholesale dissatisfaction with the new system. Consideration has, however, been given to customer reaction in the redesign of the bill format and structure.

       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       As the honourable member will be aware, the voluntary Code of Conduct for Australian companies with commercial interests in South Africa came into effect on 29 November 1985. The Code applies to Australian companies if they or their subsidiaries employ non-white labour in South Africa. Monitoring of the level of corporate adherence to the Code is being undertaken independently by an Administrator for the Code, Mr Ron Bannerman, A.O., who will report his initial findings to parliament through the Minister for Foreign Affairs later in the Budget session.
      </para>
      <para>
       Mr Bannerman, whose appointment took effect from 1 April 1986, has written to Australian companies with commercial interests requesting information on their activities in South Africa. The information supplied to Mr Bannerman which will form the basis of the Administrator's report is being provided by companies on a ``commercial in confidence basis''. Given the as yet preliminary stage of Mr Bannerman's investigation, the independent nature of his position, and the confidentiality of the information provided at this stage, I am unable to give a more specific response to the honourable member's question.
      </para>
      <para>
       I can say, however, that so far there have been no indications that Australian companies will not cooperate with the Code. Both in my own consultations with the business sector, and in those Mr Bannerman has conducted since his appointment, the response has been one of understanding the reasons for the introduction of the Code and of acceptance of the desirability of cooperating with the Government to make it an effective instrument.

       (1) It is not possible to answer this question in terms of specific chemicals. The variability in regulations and interpretation of the term `banned' between countries makes keeping records of controlled substances in other countries an impossible task. The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) has over the past few years attempted to develop such a list but with little success. Australia operates an independent clearance and assessment systems for drugs, agricultural chemicals and food additivies.

       (6) An international agreement exists within both the OECD and UNEP to provide other members of regulatory decisions taken by another member. Consequently information about decisions taken by EEC countries and the USA is frequently communicated to Australia. In addition the USA also provides information to other countries of chemicals exported from the USA that are not permitted to be used in the USA.
      </para>
      <para>
       (a) In the event that a regulatory decision is based on important new data indicating a new health risk from the use of the chemical, such information is usually communicated urgently to other countries, including Australia.
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) (i) In the case of agricultural chemicals and drugs this information would be urgently considered by the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) or Australian Drug Evaluation Committee (ADEC) and any decision to control the chemical would be communicated to State authorities. For example, in 1977 information was communicated to Australia from the USA that a fungicide caused testicular effects and sterility in workers in the manufacturing plant. In addition animal studies indicated the compound to be a carcinogen. This information was considered by the NHMRC and within the space of 1-2 weeks the product had been rescheduled in all States and arrangements made to withdraw stocks from sale.
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) (ii) Notification of the public by Commonwealth and State authorities would take place where there is considered to be an urgent need to cease use of the product immediately and to ensure that remaining stocks are withdrawn.

       (b) Distribution of the booklet was carried out through both Australian Post and Salmat Direct Marketing Pty Ltd.

      <para>
       (3) No, the arrangements called for a solus delivery.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) Yes, and the Commonwealth will not be paying for the distribution of those booklets. Further, in relation to the very small quantity of booklets where this happened, the honourable member should realise that this was a deliberate piece of sabotage by the individual contracted for this delivery. This was done entirely without the authority of the distribution house or the Commonwealth and was certainly not sanctioned by either. The distribution house dismissed the individual concerned, refused payment for the deliveries and is investigating its options for taking legal action against that person.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) No, there were minor problems in a few localised areas. However, in planning the booklet distribution the campaign team anticipated that a portion of deliveries would go astray and therefore placed advertisements in newspapers around the country advising those who might have missed out on delivery of a toll free telephone number they could call to secure alternative delivery.
      </para>
      <para>
       (6) The majority were delivered between 10 and 13 April. There were some instances of late delivery.

       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) I am asured by Kockmuns AB of Malmo Sweden that no Soviet Trade Delegation visited the submarine section of the shipyard or United Stirling, a subsidiary of Kockums, last year or at any other time. I am assured by Kockums AB of Sweden that at no time has the Soviet Union been given access to information of a restricted or confidential nature. Kockums has a strict internal security system which protects the work being carried out for the Royal Australian Navy as well as Swedish projects. Though in the same area, the Stirling closed cycle engine facility is not part of Kockums AB. However it also has strict security procedures. The most recent visit of a Soviet delegation to that facility was one decade ago, when only material of a general commercial nature was discussed.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) The Soviets have not been given construction or performance information relating to the United Stirling closed cycle engine or any other technology involved in submarine construction or operational information, or material relevant to Kockums participation in the RAN New Submarine Project Definition Study.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) I am aware of the report by Mr R. Jonson and have a report from the Swedish Government on this matter. I am also aware of relevant newspaper articles written by Mr Carson, a journalist resident in Malmo Sweden. This may be the source of the information prompting the question.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) The subject of the Swedish Government report relates to an incident in the USA during a commercial development programme in 1974/5/6 of a Solar Powered Stirling engine system, not a United Stirling closed cycle engine for Submarines. A subsidiary of the Swedish FFV Company was developing the solar powered system with McDonald Douglas and a member of the Soviet Embassy in Washington, posing as an American Engineer, attempted to gain access to the plant at Alexandria, Virginia USA but was identified and asked to leave the plant without receiving any information whatsoever. I am not aware that the Soviet Union is developing a Stirling Closed Cycle Engine.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) The United Stirling closed engine is offered as an option in the Kockums 471 submarine under study for the RAN and is being considered for Auxiliary Air Independant propulsion. Like other diesel engines the United Stirling closed cycle engine is commercially available in various versions for fitting in such vehicles as motor transport, ships, and submarines etc.

       There is no intention at the present time to review the Aerodrome Local Ownership Plan (ALOP). However, over the next decade, circumstances could arise which would lead to a review. There are currently some 270 locally owned aerodromes throughout Australia receiving Commonwealth financial assistance for development or maintenance works under the ALOP. All proposals for funds under this plan are considered on their merits. Since Commonwealth expenditure under the ALOP is attributable to the aviation industry for cost recovery purposes, benefits to the industry have to be demonstrated before projects are approved.

        —The Minister for Education has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) Since September 1985 the Department of Education has administered the Commonwealth's Capital Grants Program.
      </para>
      <para>
       As successful applicants for a Commonwealth capital grant are generally expected to contribute to projects from their own resources, information is sought on the financial operations of a school and its supporting community. This information is used to determine the maximum capacity of a school to contribute to a capital project.
      </para>
      <para>
       In some States, Catholic systemic primary schools operate as parochial schools. The parish is therefore responsible for assisting in the provision of the school's capital facilities. Information on the parish's financial operations is sought in order to assess the level of contribution that can be made towards a Commonwealth funded project at the school. In determining the parish's contribution towards the project, account is taken of existing and projected commitments to other parish projects. Where a school is supported by a number of parishes, as may be the case with Catholic systemic secondary schools, information is obtained from all supporting parishes.
      </para>
      <para>
       In certain circumstances, a diocese may co-ordinate a program of capital works at all Catholic systemic schools within the diocese. In this instance, financial operations of the diocese may be taken into account in determining an overall contribution to the complete program.
      </para>
      <para>
       Where parishes are not directly responsible for capital works at their schools, reliance is placed on the advice of the system authorities in determining a school's capacity to contribute to a project.
      </para>
      <para>
       Catholic non-systemic schools are independent schools and are therefore solely responsible for both their capital and recurrent operations. Consequently, only the financial circumstances of the school are relevant in any consideration of the financial need for a grant.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) The Education Resources Index (ERI) is used to determine the funding category for non-government schools. The ERI compares a school's private income with a standard level of resources representing basic educational needs of schools.
      </para>
      <para>
       Details of the General Recurrent Grants Program, including information on the establishment grants and the Short Term Emergency Assistance Scheme components of that Program, are provided in the publication `Commonwealth Programs for Schools, Administrative Guidelines for 1986'. Chapter 2 and Appendix A are particularly relevant. A copy of this document has been forwarded to Mr Wright.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) In 1986 some $47.7m is available specifically to non-government schools under five Commonwealth specific purpose programs administered by the Commonwealth Schools Commission:

       (b) sales of WACs occur at numerous `Collector of Public Monies (CPM)' facilities throughout Australia. Proceeds from this source are paid into consolidated revenue along with other monies received-thus the overall income from WACs cannot be readily obtained.

       (ii) The Department does not sell AIP/MAP or VFG/MAP to pilots. The MAP package appropriate to each licence category is provided free of charge to all pilots.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Department sells AIP Complete and VFG Complete, both of which contain the respective MAP component, to other interested parties. It is not possible to extract individual figures for these items.

       (4) No. The Department of Aviation believes that the individual charts mentioned in the question have quite specific uses which serve the industry better than would a combined chart.

      <para>
       (1) A copy of Austrade's current 1986-87 forward programme of trade fairs and displays is attached. The list shows the estimated cost of each show and of participation by Australian firms.

      </para>
      <para>
       (4) At the conclusion of each display, exhibitors are asked to complete a confidential report form indicating results achieved by them including, specifically, sales realised or under negotiation. Trade Commissioners and/or Austrade State office personnel maintain contact as required with those exhibitors securing on-going business. As displays are usually a part of an inter-related series of activities, it is usually not productive to seek to attribute specific sales to any single event.

      <para>
       (1) Has the Minister's attention been drawn to an article in Australian Society of May 1986 entitled `Lies, damned lies and mining statistics' which reveals a $13m anomaly in Australian Bureau of Statistics figures for 1983-84 mining exploration expenditure.

        —The Minister for Resources and Energy has provided the following answer to the honourable member's question.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) Yes. On 16 April 1986, the ABS published a corrigendum to the 1983-84 NT exploration statistics which said that the incorrect figures resulted from a compilation error by the ABS. I responded to the article in a letter published in Australian Society, June 1986 edition, page 4.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) The words in quotation marks are taken directly from my Press Release of 4 March 1986. Nevertheless the article is inaccurate in implying that the revision of the statistics casts doubt on the basis for the Government's decision of 3 March 1986 to amend the NT Aboriginal Land Rights Act. The level of NT exploration expenditure recorded by ABS, whether for 1983-84 or any other year since the NT Aboriginal Land Rights Act entered into force, relates almost solely to exploration activity on non-Aboriginal land because up until July 1986 no new exploration licences have been granted on Aboriginal land.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) Although the decline in international commodity prices, the Government's uranium policy and the NT Government's freeze on the processing of exploration licence applications on Aboriginal land have all tended to dampen mineral exploration activity in the NT, the operation of the NT Aboriginal Land Rights Act has been an important constraint on mineral exploration in the NT. While the NT Government lifted its freeze on the processing of exploration licence applications on Aboriginal land in June 1981 it is only now that the granting of the first new exploration licence on Aboriginal land appears imminent, following approval by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs in July 1986 of an agreement between a mining company and the Northern Land Council. While the conclusion of this agreement is an important precedent the fact remains that 178 other exploration licence applications remain outstanding on Aboriginal land, and in all 32 other cases (previously 26 when I issued my Press Statement of 4 March) where consultations between companies, Land Councils and traditional Aboriginal landowners have been completed, consent to exploration on Aboriginal land has been refused.
      </para>
      <para>
       I am advised that first year exploration commitments on currently outstanding exploration licence applications in Arnhem Land alone, all of which have been unable to proceed because negotiations have led to refusal of consent or are stalled, amount to at least $19.3 million.

        —The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows (parts 1, 2, 4 to 8 and 10 were prepared from advice received from TAA):
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) TAA advises that its policy is to provide smoking and non-smoking seating zones with seating capacity as close as possible to the balance of preferences.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) TAA also advises that its policy of separate zones is made known when passengers check in and by inflight announcements shortly before or after take off.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) The Air Navigation Regulations (at ANR 246 (1) (a) and (b)) make certain provisions relating to smoking in aircraft in connection with safety issues. The Air Navigation Regulations (at ANR 312 (4)) also provide for a penalty of $2,500 or 6 months imprisonment or both for any breach of ANR's prosecuted summarily.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) TAA has advised that the cabin atmospheric control systems installed in its aircraft provide total air replacement at high frequency quickly removing smoke. The airline has also advised that passenger comments indicate the majority of non-smokers are satisfied with existing seating arrangements.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) Should the non-smoking passenger be affected due to seating arrangements, TAA advised that its flight attendants would assist to alter seating if appropriate.
      </para>
      <para>
       (6) Smoking is completely prohibited while the ``non-smoking'' indicator is lighted. Under the Air Navigation Regulations, the pilot in command of an aircraft is required to ensure that a notice indicating that smoking is prohibited is displayed during take-off, landing and refuelling, during such periods as specified for the purpose in the aircraft's certificate or airworthiness or flight manual and during a period which he or she considers that smoking should be prohibited in the interests of safety. TAA advises that the pilots in command of its aircraft have full discretion as to the use of the ``non-smoking'' indicator. Smoking during periods when the ``non-smoking'' indicator is lighted involves a breach of the Air Navigation Regulations.
      </para>
      <para>
       (7) The airlines' present general ratio of seat allocations to smoking/non-smoking is as follows:
      </para>
      <para>
       Ansett-25:75
      </para>
      <para>
       TAA-30:70
      </para>
      <para>
       EWA-16:84 on F27 aircraft; 14:86 on F28 aircraft.
      </para>
      <para>
       I am advised by TAA that where possible that TAA non-smoking zone is extended if demand is expected to be excessive. Occasionally, the airline advises, not every non-smoking preference can be accommodated.
      </para>
      <para>
       (8) Under current arrangements, allocation of non-smoking seats is a matter for the commercial judgment of the airlines. I announced on 5 March 1986 that in view of the continuing concern expressed by many people about the perceived effects of smoking in aircraft on their health and comfort, I considered it appropriate that an attempt should be made to achieve a more acceptable compromise between the views of smoking and non-smoking passengers.
      </para>
      <para>
       For that reason I wrote to the domestic airlines seeking their reaction to a proposal that they move as a group to introduce a ban on smoking on flights of less than one and a half hours. Further consideration is being given to the matter.
      </para>
      <para>
       (9) I am not aware of any current proposals by the US Government to ban smoking on short-haul aircraft.
      </para>
      <para>
       (10) TAA has no current proposals to ban smoking on flights of less than one hour duration. See also answer to question 8.

      <para>
       (1) Yes. Also, the matter was considered by the National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) at its 101st Session in June 1986. The Council endorsed the Report of its Working Party on the Effects of Passive Smoking on Health and recommended certain policies be considered by health authorities to protect the health of non-smokers from passive smoking.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) to (4) Responsibility for development of guidelines and legislation on the regulation of smoking in Commonwealth Government work areas and on Commonwealth transport rests with the Public Service Board and the Department of Transport, respectively. My Department provides advice on the health risks of passive smoking as such advice is sought. Additional to this are the advice and recommendations of the NHMRC. However, the honourable member will be pleased to learn that, to protect the health of its employees from injury or illness arising from the workplace, and following consultations with management and union representatives, my Department will be extending existing smoke free areas to include all office space occupied by Departmental staff from 1 December 1986.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) My Department works closely with the State and Territory health authorities on this issue through avenues such as the Australian Health Ministers' Advisory Council and the Standing Committee of Officials of the Ministerial Council on Drug Strategy. It remains, however, a matter for each State and Territory to introduce regulations to control smoking in public places and work areas within their respective jurisdictions.

       `Firstly, to confirm that the vast majority of Christmas Islanders want a hotel/casino on Christmas Island and hopefully that will show the Department of Territories that the community is overwhelmingly in favour of it and may speed things up.

       3 to 6. The Government has agreed in principle to the establishment of a resort complex with a casino on Christmas Island, subject to development and approval of a detailed proposal which provides for adequate protection of Commonwealth, Island and environmental interests. The Government has also agreed that Western Australian businessman Mr Frank Woodmore, the proponent of the project, have first right of refusal to the development.
      </para>

       An important element of Mr Woodmore's proposal was that Federal Hotels be the operator of the casino element of the Christmas Island project. The Government has agreed that Federal Hotels be the casino operator.

       Detailed arrangements regarding licensing and control of the casino operator have not yet been determined. However these issues will be addressed during detailed feasibility studies.

       (3) To answer the honourable member's question satisfactorily would require the provision of a list of specific payments made to some 730 individuals. However, the following tables which contain averages maybe useful. The following payments were made to PMCI employees upon termination. Payments are in accordance with relevant awards/agreements and include redundancy payments.

        —The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) $231m. It is to be a fixed price contract in Australian dollars, with escalation clauses for inflation and exchange rate variations and any changes arising from translation of drawings to English.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) There is no contract for production of the Wamira and so no contract price can be stated. The expenditure on design and development of the Wamira was about $74m.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) It is estimated that the expenditure on the Pilatus PC-9 will be in the following proportions; Australia 45%, Switzerland 24% and elsewhere 31%.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) It was estimated that, should the A10B WAMIRA project have progressed, 55% of the project cost would have been spent in Australia and the remainder overseas for the procurement of engines, avionics and other items.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) The PC-9 project is estimated to generate about 1.5 million manhours of work in Australia whilst the A10B WAMIRA project was estimated to generate just over 2 million manhours. Additional workload however, will be generated by the collaboration of the Australian aircraft industry with Pilatus in global sales of the PC-9 and the development of a new utility transport aircraft should we choose to enter this programme.
      </para>
      <para>
       (6) At the peak of the A10 design work some 120 engineers were involved. Some 75% of these engineers are still employed in the Australian aircraft industry.
      </para>
      <para>
       (7) The higher performance of the PC-9 offers the potential for savings by reducing student flying hours in the more expensive MACCHI advanced trainer.
      </para>
      <para>
       (8) These will begin in early 1990.
      </para>
      <para>
       (9) No.
      </para>
      <para>
       (10) Yes, in the general roles they now perform. A review of the pilot training syllabus and the respective aircraft's roles is planned.
      </para>
      <para>
       (11) Replacements for the CT4 and the Macchi are not envisaged until the late 1990's. The RAAF study into pilot training will determine the final breakdown of flying hours between the three aircraft but the current 140 hours spent by students on the Macchi advanced trainer will be reduced considerably by the introduction of the cheaper to operate Pilatus PC-9.
      </para>
      <para>
       (12) It is not proposed to take any action to extend the life of these aircraft.
      </para>
      <para>
       (13) Yes. Less student flying time will be spent on the more expensive MACCHI aircraft.
      </para>
      <para>
       (14) Yes. The cost of modifications is about $2.5m. The major modification is to the under carriage to give a soft field landing ability.
      </para>
      <para>
       (15) The A10 WAMIRA project was based on a pilot training syllabus of 100 hours WAMIRA and 100 hours MACCHI. As previously stated, the training syllabus will be subject to review when the PC-9 enters service.

      <para>
       (1) The Australian Aircraft Industry Study Group comprising the major companies of the Australian aerospace industry in its report of June 1980 concluded that `no existing trainer meets all the requirements of the relevant Staff Target'.
      </para>
      <para>
       (a) This assessment was accepted.
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) This assessment preceded the letting of a contract for project definition studies to the same Australian Industry Study Group.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) The Pilatus PC-9 was not in service when the studies were concluded and the Study Group did not propose it as an option.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) Yes.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) Yes. The Government on 15 December 1985 announced the termination of the contract with the Australian Aircraft Consortium on the grounds that there were insufficient defence strategic or industry policy grounds to justify the substantial premium required to complete the Wamira project.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) The total costs incurred by the Commonwealth when the WAMIRA project was terminated was about $74m. The AAC component was about $64m.
      </para>
      <para>
       (6) As the WAMIRA was not built or tested, its performance cannot be determined.
      </para>
      <para>
       (7) No.
      </para>
      <para>
       (8) On 8 July 1985 the Government, noting that the Wamira project had slipped 18 months and that the estimated cost of completion of the project had increased over 77 per cent in real terms to a direct cost of over $350m, announced that a competition was to be conducted to explore cheaper options for providing the RAAF with a suitable basic trainer aircraft.
      </para>
      <para>
       (9) No.
      </para>
      <para>
       (10) Work stopped on the A10B prototype on 15 December 1985. See answer to (5) for the cost.
      </para>
      <para>
       (11) No, but the aircraft we will acquire will substantially meet the requirements of the Air Force.
      </para>
      <para>
       (12) The PC-9 acquired by the RAAF will have enlarged low pressure tyres to enable it to land on soft fields. The cost of all modifications is about $2.5m.

       As I mentioned in the Senate on 5 May 1986 (Hansard, page 2370), the Australian Atomic Energy Commission (AAEC) has established a task group to examine and evaluate all available information on the Chernobyl accident. The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) is sponsoring a meeting of technical experts to consider the implications of the Chernobyl accident, to be held in Vienna from 25 to 29 August. It is my intention that as soon as practicable after this meeting the AAEC task group will finalise a report which will be made available to the public.

       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) Since March 1983 4 additional Aboriginal and Islander community-controlled child care agencies (AICCAs) have been approved for funding under the Children's Services Program. These are:
      </para>
      <para>
       (i) Yuddika Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Corporation, Cairns
      </para>

      </para>
      <para>
       (iv) Central Australia Child Care Agency, Alice Springs
      </para>
      <para>
       Funding has also been approved for the Secretariat of National Aboriginal and Islander Child Care (SNAICC), a peak organisation for AICCAs throughout Australia.
      </para>
      <para>
       In addition, 30 new Aboriginal childrens care services were approved for funding during this period.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) The increase in the recurrent financial allocation to Aboriginal and Islander child care agencies and other Aboriginal children's services in the federal budget since 1982-83 is $3.4 million and distributed as follows:
      </para>
      <para>
       (i) Newly funded Aboriginal and Islander Child Care Agencies-$651 182
      </para>
      <para>

       (iii) Increases in funding to existing services-$1 053 011
      </para>
      <para>
       In addition to the above, over the same period funds totalling $686 076 have been allocated to Aboriginal organisations in the form of one-off or capital grants.
      </para>
      <para>
       Actual capital and recurrent expenditure levels on Aboriginal services in 1982/83 are not available. It is therefore not possible to calculate the increased financial allocation in the federal budget since 1982/83 in real terms.

       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) The effectiveness of particular sanctions is a matter which receives on-going consideration by the Ministerial Council for Companies and Securities. This has been reflected, for example, in the amendments contained in the Companies and Securities Legislation (Miscellaneous Amendments) Act 1985 restraining the directors of some insolvent companies from subsequently managing other companies. The matter will be discussed at the next meeting.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) Generally, Commonwealth legislation at present prescribes fines, imprisonment or fines and imprisonment for criminal offences. In the case of bodies corporate imprisonment is not a sentencing option. Some legislation also provides for pecuniary penalties and other remedies such as injunctions which can be applied to corporations. Publicity orders can be made under existing legislation such as the Trade Practices Act 1974 where the court considers such an order to be appropriate. The Australian Law Reform Commission is currently considering the appropriateness of sanctions such as corporate community service orders, corporate probation orders and equity fines and also whether the option of making publicity orders in relation to corporations which commit offences should be more generally available than at present. The Commission's final report on its reference concerning the sentencing of federal and ACT offenders is expected to be presented in 1987.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) It is considered that at this time the sanctions provided for in the Trade Practices Act 1974 are adequate in relation to both major and minor corporate crime.

The proposal has not yet been considered by the Commonwealth.

       (a) The sum outstanding in respect of loans disbursed from the former Aboriginal Benefit Trust Fund (ABTF) as at 28 February 1986 is $329,612.12.
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) The major recipients of loans from the ABTF were the Roper River Citizens Club ($160,000) and the Umbakumba Development Association ($80,000). The majority of loans were for lesser amounts made to individual borrowers and other Aboriginal Associations.
      </para>
      <para>
       (14) The sum outstanding in respect of loans made by the ABTF represents approximately 26% of the total amount paid out as loans by the ABTF between 1966 and 1978. Of that total paid out as loans, approximately 25% had been recovered by 30 June 1978, and a further 49% approximately had been repaid from 1978 to date.
      </para>
      <para>
       As the terms of the loans varied between 4 and 23 years, finalization will depend on the loan term, the amount of any arrears and the borrower's capacity to continue repayments in the case of each loan.

       (15) The Government is investigating the most practicable means of verifying the accuracy of uranium royalty receipts in respect to mining on Aboriginal land in the Northern Territory.
      </para>
      <para>
       In respect of the mining of other minerals on Aboriginal land, royalties are received by the Northern Territory under a law of the Territory, and those royalty receipts are audited by the Territory to ensure that they are correct.

       (16) With reference to the monitoring of the effectiveness of payments made specifically for the benefit of Aboriginals from the Trust Account, the ABTA was the subject of a review by a Committee under the Chairmanship of Dr J Altman of the Australian National University.
      </para>
      <para>
       Certain recommendations arising from that review have already been implemented, including the expansion of the ABTA Advisory Committee from 7 to 12 members, to enable a greater representation of Aborigines in the Northern Territory to consider funding proposals, and make grant recommendations. A Sub-Committee to the ABTA has also been formed pursuant to the review recommendations, to assist the Advisory Committee with financial policies and grant proposals.
      </para>
      <para>
       In particular, the ABTA Advisory Committee, with the assistance of the Sub-Committee, will be reviewing on an annual basis the effectiveness of its positive expenditure policies in terms of the benefit accruing to the Aboriginal population of the Northern Territory.

       (18) Since November 1985 the Department has been in the process of enhancing its ADP system to provide an integrated data base for grants management. This system is now operative in the Department's Central Office and is progressively being introduced to the Regional Offices.
      </para>
      <para>
       (19) The Department's letters of offer of grants to Aboriginal organisations now stipulate the objectives and outcomes that are expected to be achieved during the course of the funding year for every project. A program item appraisal is required toward the end of the financial year to enable the Department to assess and advise on the degree to which aims and objectives are being achieved for each project and, if necessary, recommend changes in the application of future resources. The control of assets is at present covered by a requirement for an annual audited statement of assets.

       (20) The Government decided in 1985 that the term of office of members of the National Aboriginal Conference (NAC) would not be extended beyond 30 June 1985. The Commonwealth has accepted liability for National Aboriginal Conference liabilities and liquidation expenses as it was considered necessary to provide for termination payments for members and staff, and certain liabilities outstanding at 30 June 1985.

       `I consider it important that the research program be commenced before substantial work on the uranium project begins. The research program is intended to establish baseline data on the social environment. I would then envisage a continuing research program to provide up-dated information and thus to monitor and report changes as they occur. You might refer to part 13 of the second report of the Ranger Uranium Environmental Inquiry (the 204 Report) which indicates what is needed in general form'.

       (1) I assume the honourable member is referring to the television advertisement for `Four-X' beer which purports to show an Army patrol drinking this product. No Army unit or individual was authorised to participate in this advertisement and I am advised that based on available information no members participated in a private capacity.

Negotiations are continuing to register a mortgage over each of the properties purchased through the 1984-85 Community Housing Expansion Program grants. In the interim, caveats have been lodged against all properties where a registered mortgage is being sought. The Commonwealth is a co-signatory of the Bank account of the remaining co-operative that has not fully expended the amount of the grant.

       (4) (a) The inquiry by Mr O'Donovan into the Community Housing Expansion Program did not make any findings in relation to the management of Housing Branch other than to acknowledge that successful implementation of the Community Housing Expansion Program required much time and skilled work by knowledgeable people at a stage when the Department of Territories and Local Government had for some years been `starved of resources'.

        —The answers to the honourable member's questions are as follows:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) (a) The main kinds of petroleum products used by the Australian Defence Force and the Department of Defence are liquid fuels and lubricants. The liquid fuels take the form of aviation turbine fuel (AVTUR), aviation gasoline (AVGAS), motor spirit, automotive distillate and Naval distillate. In addition to these, Defence currently holds stocks of Furnace Fuel Oil and a range of lubricating oils. The liquid fuels account for the bulk of current Defence requirements.
      </para>
      <para>
       (1) (b) The aviation fuels are used in the propulsion of aircraft, both fixed and rotary wing. Automotive distillate is used in the Army's track vehicles, eg tanks and armoured personnel carriers, as well as other operational transport and commercial type vehicles. Motor spirit is used primarily in small vehicles and cars used for administrative purposes. Naval distillate is used in gas and steam turbine as well as compression ignition engines for the propulsion of ships and submarines. Furnace fuel oil is used in steam turbine engines only. Lubricating oils are used for protection and maintenance of various Defence equipment. Petroleum products are also used in the factories and dockyards of the office of Defence Production.

       (3) Different fuels are purchased at a wide variety of outlets, including remote and overseas localities; as well fuel is purchased for sale to the Defence Forces of other governments, the cost being recoverable to revenue. Therefore quantities and costs can be difficult to forecast accurately.

       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) and (2) In deciding the basis for trade union and corporate representation on Government trade delegations, the underlying principle adopted by the Department of Trade and the Australian Trade Commission is whether a direct commercial benefit accrues to the organisation which provides a representative. The costs of trade union representatives are normally borne by the Government since no direct commercial benefit to the unions is involved. However, the relevant trade union authorities and the Government may agree from time to time on cost sharing arrangements. For corporate representatives, the costs are borne by the Government where the purpose of the delegation is such that firms are unlikely to obtain direct benefits. However where a direct benefit is likely, such as when the Commission organises a selling mission to enable Australian companies to pursue individual export sales prospects, the corporate representatives are required to pay their own direct travel and sustenance costs.

        —The answer to the honourable member's question is as follows:
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) (a) The taxiway improvement program will reduce runway occupancy times to provide for an estimated 2% increase in practical runway capacity. However, the primary aim of the program is to reduce taxiing distance for aircraft on the ground thereby producing not only savings in runway operation delay costs but substantial benefits to airlines from savings in aircraft taxiing costs.
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) Safety is not being compromised at Sydney Airport. The only issue is the delay of aircraft and the resultant costs. I am advised that unfavourable weather, which affects the available runways and taxiway configurations, is the most likely cause of delay at Sydney, followed closely by noise abatement and wake turbulence procedures. While new radar displays would undoubtedly assist air traffic control, nevertheless, because of the constraints previously mentioned, there would only be a marginal increase in the maximum traffic handling rate of the ATC system.
      </para>
      <para>
       Current plans are for the timely replacement of the air traffic control radar display system at Sydney as part of a national program.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) (a) Taxiway improvements are estimated to cost $19m (November 1985 prices) with expenditure spread over a three (3) year program.
      </para>
      <para>
       (b) The estimated cost of new radar displays for the Sydney Terminal Area is $5.5m.

       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para>
       (1) Has his attention been drawn to the address delivered by Mr L. Watson, Group Controller, Fresh Produce Department, G. J. Coles &amp; Co. Ltd, Melbourne, in January 1986 to the Bureau of Agricultural Economics Conference in Canberra.
      </para>
      <para>
       (2) If so, did the address by Mr Watson include a section dealing with the irradiation of fresh produce which stated that the proponents of irradiation in the fresh produce industry has overlooked one very important point and that was the consumer.
      </para>
      <para>
       (3) Did the Public Health Committee (PHC) of the National Health and Medical Research Council recently endorse a recommendation of the Food Standards Committee that there was a need for a public education program concerning food irradiation and did the PHC direct that a working party be set up to carry out that task.
      </para>
      <para>
       (4) Is it a fact that the public education program will have as its primary thrust the production and distribution of a public education leaflet aimed at explaining the safety and advantages of food irradiation.
      </para>
      <para>
       (5) What will be the cost of the leaflet's (a) preparation, (b) printing and (c) distribution.
      </para>
      <para>
       (6) What will be the cost of the overall program.
      </para>
      <para>
       (7) Will the finances for the program come from a Budget allocation; if not, where will they come from.
      </para>
      <para>
       (8) What is the name of the company or organisation which has received the contract for the education program.
      </para>
      <para>
       (9) Was the contract for the education program on irradiation of food put out to tender; if so, when were tenders called and in what forum were the tenders called.
      </para>
      <para>
       (10) Did Mr Watson further state that the fresh produce industry simply cannot afford to try to go it alone in pioneering the use of food irradiation technology in this country and that there should be an endeavour to devise some alternative name other than irradiation, which would hopefully have less of a `scary' image for the shopper and ultimate consumer.
      </para>
      <para>
       (11) When will he answer question No. 3813 relating to the irradiation of food.
      </para>
      <para>
       (12) Further to my question No. 3813, part (3), does the new model provide for two additional new alternatives on the labelling of food processed by ionising radiation, if so, will this allow for a less `scary' image.

       (4)-(9) As the Government has decided on a further consumer inquiry into food irradiation, the NHMRC will not be proceeding with its public education program.

       (10) Yes.

      <para>
       (11) See ``Answers to Questions and Index to Speeches for Period of Sittings from 11 February 1986 to 5 June 1986'' (House of Representatives, 5 June 1986).
      </para>
      <para>
       (12) No. The model regulation approved by NHMRC at its 101st Session in June 1986 requires that: `There shall be written in the label on or attached to a package containing food that has been processed by ionizing radiation, in standard type of 3 mm, the words ``TREATED WITH IONIZING RADIATION'' or ``IRRADIATED (here insert the name of the food)''.
      </para>
      <para>
       Either of these alternative ways of labelling food processed by ionizing radiation would clearly indicate to the consumer that the food had been so treated and would thereby enable an informed choice to be made.

      <para>
       A series of delays were experienced in the delivery of 1985-86 taxation forms to tax agents. First, there were a number of legislative changes occurring late in the year, all of which had to be accurately reflected in taxation forms in a way to enable them to be understood and administered. Industrial action was experienced during the course of printing some of the forms and this led to further delay. In the end, the delay in delivery of taxation forms was made worse by further industrial action in June affecting the distribution of supplies.
      </para>
      <para>
       The Commissioner assures me that he is most conscious of the need to have timely supplies of taxation forms available for tax agents and will be making renewed efforts to achieve timely distribution next year. For the current year, appropriate recognition will be given to the situation of tax agents who can demonstrate that their lodgment performance is seriously affected by the delays in distribution that did occur.
