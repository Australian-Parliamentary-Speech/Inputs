              <span class="HPS-Small">As we all aware of child care educator crisis all over in Australia; I am hereby suggesting a solution to include "child care worker (group leader only)" occupation back in skilled occupation list of Australia so that overseas childcare worker or those who are struggling to find the employer in a complex process can apply their visa by themselves without relocating from one place to another. Although their is DAMA 482 and 494 visas are in place, but these are very complex visa and one cannot find the good outcome out of it. Child care worker(group leader only) are in high demand and child care centers are struggling to find the candidates because the occupation in not on SOL.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">A humanitarian catastrophe has unfolded in Tigray due to the siege enforced by the Ethiopian, Eritrean Governments and Amhara Militia. </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Since November 2020, the genocidal war on Tigray has seen over 500,000 deaths. Over 100,000 women and girls as young as six have been victims of sexual violence. More than 70,000 Tigrayans were forced to flee their homes to neighbouring Sudan, remaining in vulnerable conditions as reported by reputable international media and documented by UN organisations.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Ethiopian and Eritrean Governments continue to commit war crimes and caused a deliberate man-made famine through weaponised starvation. Drones have been utilised to bombard residential areas daily, resulting in civilian deaths, including children.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The siege on Tigray has exacerbated the suffering of Tigrayans. Tigray's only functioning hospital has shortages of medical equipment, causing the inability of patients to receive medical support and die of preventable conditions.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We therefore ask the House to 1) Consider the intake of Tigrayan refugees and grant humanitarian visas for those in Sudan and neighbouring countries. Refugees deserve the right of protection, and Australia should implement solutions that enforce safety for those at risk of persecution in their home countries. 2) Triple Australia's aid commitment to-date and support humanitarian groups on the ground, such as MSF and ICRC. 3) Discontinue all non-emergency support to the Ethiopian and Eritrean governments. Impose economic-diplomatic sanctions to assist in defunding this genocidal war and request for the immediate withdrawal of Ethiopian and Eritrean forces to end the siege on Tigray. </span>

A Republic is an opportunity for Independence and the creation of a new foundation of Government, which importantly enables bringing together one of the oldest cultures in the world ; Indigenous Australians with the increasingly multicultural society that is Australia. Unity and Justice, modern take on democracy for our beautiful island home. A chance to assist in healing our people, enable positive change and improve the structure of Government and build much needed and practical infrastructure. Give power back to the Australian people and importantly give the 'landback' to the Aboriginal &amp; Torres Strait Islander people. Let the Australian people make their own decisions for their country. Power to the people. Sovereignty never ceded. </span>

Australia is a modern multicultural society we need a modern &amp; Independent Government whom knows it's people. We can become a stronger country by doing so. Build needed infrastructure and fulfill the needs of the people for a healthy and more productive population. Ie. Rural areas all over Australia need more hospitals, schools, mental health facilities, rehabilitation services. Etc </span>

I am the victim of one such offender, secured a conviction and have applied for redress through our National Redress Scheme ("the Scheme"). Many others will follow after me, needing a formalised apology and financial justice. The peak body for our sport, Gymnastics Australia, qualifies financially to sign on, and stated almost two years ago it was "on-boarding" with the Scheme. I applied over a year ago, and still GA have not signed up. The Federal Government has the power to withdraw the millions of dollars in funding it delivers to Gymnastics Australia if it refuses to sign up. Our government set up these trigger provisions because it recognised that organisations do not always keep to their promises. We ask the government to exercise its trigger provisions if GA has not signed up by December 2022.</span>

According to one of the witnesses, Mahsa had spoken about being severely hit in the head by the police while being transferred. She was transported to Kasra hospital in less than a few hours and was declared brain-dead on arrival. Subsequently, she was announced dead on September 15.</span>

The effectiveness of medications supplied by online suppliers cannot be guaranteed and some may even be toxic to pets.

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Our high voter turnout rate has been a proud bedrock of our Australian democracy. According to the Australian Electoral Commission however, the voter turnout rate has slowly declined since the 1990s. Just focusing on the House of Representatives, it has gradually fallen at each federal election, with for example: 95.3% (1990); 94.9% (2001); 93.2% (2010); and 91.9% (2019) of voters casting their vote. Our 2022 election saw only 89.8% of voters casting a vote. (Although COVID was a hurdle in 2022, we had heavy advertising in multiple languages, across traditional media and social media platforms, about voting options with twelve days of early voting, as well as postal and telephone voting options available—all unheard of prior to 2000.) Australia's population has grown significantly since 1990, and this means more voters by percentage and more voters by number, have either disengaged or unengaged from our fundamental Australian democratic system. The voter turnout rate was at least 95% prior to 2000, and it is now closer to 90% as seen at the last three elections. With more than 17 million registered voters, this means some 1.7 million voters within each election decided to not vote in that election. This problem is further aggravated with approximately 5% of actual votes being cast as blank or invalid. The overall long-term decline in voter turnout rates requires urgent attention to reverse this erosion within our Australian democratic system.</span>

Nunyara has so many non-Indigenous people working in high paying positions, and as an ex employee I can vouch that some of these non-Indigenous people are prejudice, and the rest really don't take the time to know about Aboriginal culture, the people, and the issues Indigenous Australia face.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">According to the latest peer-reviewed, published papers the mRNA vaccines are far from safe and effective. The risk benefit analysis does not stack up, especially in the younger age groups. There is evidence that COVID-19 is following the vaccinated and neither hospitalization nor death are prevented by the jabs according to the latest government data. The data about serious side effects, too numerous to list, emerges with long-term side effects only just beginning to show. When looking at the review done by scientists in Queensland, clearly most of the cited literature is from 2021, yet a year later the vaccines are still recommended and even approved for babies. Using rolling data and vaccine testing for only 10 to 12 months does not allow for long term side effects to manifest and effectively means that the population is used as trial participants without their consent. Signing a no indemnity contract with a vaccine company absolves the company from responsibility for damage induced by their products, leaving the vaccine injury bill to the taxpayer. </span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Over 43 years, this regime committed unforgettable crimes and made the world less safe through terrorist acts and support of terrorism. At their worst brutal suppression, in the recent uprise following the death of Mahsa Amini, we have witnessed severe cases of crime against humanity, genocide, killing, torturing, and raping civilians, including children and teenagers, in their fight for basic human rights.</span>

Diplomatic or commercial relationships with I.R regime may contribute to the systematic violation of human rights including oppression of women, child abuse, abuse of LGBTQ individuals, ethnic cleansing, and money laundering by that regime.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Stuttering is a common yet widely misunderstood neurological communication disability that affects approximately 70 million people of the world's population. In childhood, stuttering is even more common, affecting 1 in 9 children; a third of which will stutter for their entire lives.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Stuttering, listed as a disability by the Australian Human Rights Commission (2009) and the World Health Organisation's International Classification of Functioning, Disability, and Health (2001), involves so much more than disfluent speech. Coping with stuttering includes wrestling the negative thoughts and emotions, stigma, social penalties, and an unaccepting, uneducated environment that often accompany stuttering throughout the lifespan.</span>
            </p>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The impact of negative perceptions, attitudes, stereotypes, social consequences, and a lack of knowledge and acceptance of stuttering in society, often leads to adverse effects towards academic achievements, employment opportunities, intimate and social relationships, mental health, and overall quality of life for people who stutter.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We therefore ask the House to establish a National Stuttering Awareness Week in Australia to help bring stuttering out of the shadows and into the light; provide a platform for people who stutter to share their story; provide the public with true stuttering awareness and help create a more empathic society towards stuttering; and to celebrate all generations of the stuttering community so that they feel proud of the way they speak and no longer feel alone.</span>

The Iranian government has violently cracked down on demonstrators protesting her death. The Iranian government is a threat to women's rights, human rights, and democracy worldwide and its people are being silenced. Much of the crackdown has been with the aid of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC). The IRGC is a shadow military which has brutally suppressed the Iranian people and long embezzled resources and funds belonging to them, transferring these overseas through its affiliates, including to Australia.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 27 September 2022 regarding petition (EN3955)—mandatory first aid training for school teachers.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I was saddened to learn of the death of Mr Lucas Latouche Mazzei by choking at Henley Beach Primary School in November 2017. This is truly a tragedy for his family and the entire school community.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I note the petitioner's request that first aid training be made mandatory for all teachers across the country, and I acknowledge that there is a need for teachers at public schools to be adequately trained in first aid. Presently, the exact first aid requirements for teachers varies from state to state, and possibly from school to school.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">While the petitioner requests that the Australian Government mandate that all teachers be trained and certified in first aid, decisions regarding the health and safety training requirements for teachers is the constitutional responsibility of state and territory governments or the relevant approved authority (Catholic or Independent) in their respective jurisdiction.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Ms Templeman</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to your letter regarding petition EN4008, in relation to recognition of Australia's International COVID-19 Vaccination Certificate (ICVC) in Europe, which was presented in the House of Representatives on 26 September 2022.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Over the first half of 2022, governments across Europe sharply reduced or abolished their requirements for proof of vaccination for everyday access to domestic venues and services. Where such requirements remain, Australia's ICVC is widely accepted. Australia's ICVC is also accepted at European borders that still require proof of vaccination against COVID-19.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia's missions in Europe work with local authorities to respond to specific issues that travellers report with proving their vaccination status. Our missions are finding that proof of vaccination is now rarely an issue for Australians in Europe.</span>
            </p>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 27 September 2022 enclosing Petition EN4011, with 156 signatures, concerning pediatric physiotherapists and pathways to permanent residence.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia's skilled occupation lists are for the purpose of identifying occupations in Australia where there is a genuine skills need and where migration is an appropriate solution. The Australian and New Zealand Standard Classification of Occupations framework is a skill-based system used to classify occupations and jobs in the Australian labour market and is the responsibility of the Australian Bureau of Statistics.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The occupation Physiotherapist (252511) includes Pediatric Physiotherapist as a specialisation. Physiotherapist (252511) is on the Medium and Long-term Strategic Skills List and is an eligible occupation for temporary and permanent migration. Pediatric physiotherapists can apply for permanent residence under the occupation of Physiotherapist.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">At the Jobs and Skills Summit, the Australian Government committed to assessing the effectiveness of the skilled migration occupation lists. This includes the ongoing viability of the role of the Priority Migration Skilled Occupation List, which was introduced by the previous Government to identify occupations considered to be critical for the recovery of the Australian economy, and how it works alongside other skilled migration occupation lists.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 27 September 2022 concerning Petition EN4024 which seeks an assessment of the 1 March 2022 changes made to Medicare Benefit Schedule (MBS) pain management services.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The changes implemented on 1 March 2022 to MBS pain management services were based on recommendations made by the MBS Review Taskforce in 2019. The MBS Review was a clinician-led, independent process which was undertaken over four years, 2015-2020. The MBS Review involved more than 900 doctors, health professionals and experts to provide advice to Government on how the MBS could be better aligned with contemporary clinical evidence and improve health outcomes for all Australians.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Pain Management Clinical Committee was established under the Taskforce to review 62 MBS items relating to pain management. This Committee comprised clinical experts across fields of practice including neurosurgery and neuropathic pain, radiology, anaesthetics, specialist pain medicine, and palliative care, as well as consumer representation. The Final Report of the Taskforce on MBS pain management services was published in 2019 and is available on the Department of Health and Aged Care's website at www.health.gov.au/resources/publications/taskforce-final-report-pain-management-mbs-items.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Stakeholder consultation was an integral component of the MBS Review. For the Pain Management Clinical Committee, an 8-week targeted consultation was undertaken from 5 February 2019 to 4 April 2019, with a total of 27 submissions received including from the Australian Medical Association, Australian Society of Anaesthetists, and the Faculty of Pain Medicine—Australia and New Zealand College of Anaesthetists. Following this consultation process, the Pain Management Clinical Committee considered these submissions and amended recommendations prior to finalising their draft recommendations for consideration by the Taskforce in 2019.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Following the finalisation of recommendations by the Taskforce, further consultation was undertaken in 2020 on the consequences of the final Taskforce recommendations via the Pain Management Implementation Liaison Group (ILG). The ILG included representatives from key stakeholder groups, including the Australian Medical Association; Australian Society of Anaesthetists, and the Faculty of Pain Medicine—Australian and New Zealand College of Anaesthetists and feedback was fully considered when making final changes which took effect in March 2022.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Stakeholders did not raise any issues regarding the percutaneous neurotomy services during the ILG or the legislative drafting process. Shortly before implementation of the 1 March 2022 changes, the department was advised of some concerns on the new items for percutaneous neurotomy services. These concerns were quickly addressed in consultation with stakeholders with further amendments taking effect on 11 April 2022 and communicated to the sector in the factsheet available at</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As noted in the factsheet a patient can receive percutaneous neurotomy treatment in up to three episodes of care in a 12-month period. An episode of care means one or more percutaneous neurotomy services performed in a single attendance, where clinically relevant. The percutaneous neurotomy items are claimable per joint treated, not per nerve or lesion. More than one joint in the same region can be treated and claimed on the same day (i.e. as part of the same episode), and joints in another region can also be treated in the same episode.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The changes implemented to the percutaneous neurotomy services as recommended by the Taskforce, reflect their concerns that both unnecessary treatments and incorrectly performed treatments pose risks to patients. The clinicians of the independent Taskforce maintained it was not justified to repeat the procedure inside a timeframe of less than 4 months.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The department continues to meet with the Dean, Faculty of Pain Medicine—Australia New Zealand College of Anaesthetists on a regular basis to discuss any other concerns relating to MBS pain management services. In addition, the Australian Government undertakes routine post implementation reviews of MBS changes and intends for a review to be undertaken in early 2024.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Ms Templeman</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 27 September 2022 regarding Petition (EN4025)—Request to remove maximum Literacy and Numeracy Test for Initial Teacher Education test attempts.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In response to the issues raised in the petition, I can provide the following advice.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government considers that for all teachers, no matter the year level, subjects or students they teach, strong personal literacy and numeracy skills form an essential part of the attributes and skills needed to be effective in the classroom. While personal literacy and numeracy skills are only an element of what makes a good teacher, they are necessary to foster the development of these critical skills in students, providing the building blocks for future learning.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The requirement that all initial teacher education (ITE) students possess personal literacy and numeracy skills broadly equivalent to the top 30 per cent of the Australian adult population has been in place since 2011, when all Education Ministers agreed to introduce the Accreditation of ITE Programs in Australia: Standards and Procedures (Standards and Procedures). Subsequently, in 2015, Education Ministers agreed that, from 1 July 2016, the test would be used as the means for demonstrating a student has achieved this existing literacy and numeracy standard for their profession.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Under the Standards and Procedures, higher education providers have a key role in supporting their students with the test. Higher education providers must ensure entrants to ITE possess levels of personal literacy and numeracy broadly equivalent to the top 30 per cent of the Australian adult population. Providers that select students who do not meet this requirement upon entry into the program must establish satisfactory arrangements to ensure that these students are supported to achieve the required standard before graduation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The current policy allows enrolled students three attempts to pass the test. In special circumstances, higher education providers may consider that individual students should be granted up to two additional attempts, to make a total maximum of five attempts. From there, ITE students who have exhausted all attempts can apply to have their test attempts re-set after a two-year break from study.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In December 2020, Education Ministers agreed that from 2023, prospective ITE students will have the option to sit the test before they commence their studies. This decision is intended to offer more certainty and fairness to students before they decide to invest time and resources in pursuing a teaching career. This will also give higher education providers the opportunity to provide targeted assistance to students who need additional support to meet the required standard.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As the test requirement is related to the accreditation of ITE programs and/or registration as a teacher, each state or territory is responsible for imposing the requirement relating to the test in that jurisdiction under the relevant state or territory legislation. This includes specifying how the test interacts with progression through an ITE program and/or subsequent registration as a teacher.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I trust this information is of assistance.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is a strong supporter of immunisation as a safe and effective public health measure to prevent the spread of many diseases in the community that can cause hospitalisation, serious ongoing health conditions, or even death. Whilst COVID-19 vaccination is voluntary, as are all vaccinations in Australia, everyone is encouraged to get vaccinated but still maintains the option to choose.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Please note that Medicare is Australia's universal health insurance scheme. It guarantees all Australians (and some overseas visitors) access to a wide range of health and hospital services at low or no cost.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 27 September 2022 regarding COVID-19 vaccines.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is a strong supporter of immunisation as a safe and effective public-health measure to prevent the spread of many diseases in the community that can cause hospitalisation, serious ongoing health conditions, or even death. The Government's position on COVID-19 vaccination is that it is voluntary, as are all vaccinations in Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As the COVID-19 pandemic is a public-health emergency, states and territories, who have primary responsibility for public-health, are managing the pandemic in their respective jurisdictions based on health advice. In line with this, some states and territories have issued public-health orders which require COVID-19 vaccination for people in high-risk workplaces and sectors, and for some community activities. Further information about these public-health orders can be found on state or territory government websites.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Vaccination providers must obtain consent before administering a COVID-19 vaccine. More information is available at www.health.gov.au/resources/publications/covid-19-vaccination-consent-form-for-covid-19-vaccination. For queries related to human rights please contact the Australian Human Rights Commission at www.humanrights.gov.au.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Prevention of severe illness from COVID-19 remains the primary goal of the ongoing COVID-19 vaccination program. The COVID-19 vaccines currently in use in Australia (AstraZeneca, Pfizer, Moderna and Novavax) provide significant protection against symptomatic disease, hospitalisation and death.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I note your concerns about the safety of COVID-19 vaccines. The Therapeutic Goods Administration (TGA) has comprehensively evaluated each of the provisionally registered COVID-19 vaccines available in Australia to ensure that they meet Australia's high standards of safety, quality and efficacy. A large team of technical and clinical experts at the TGA carefully review the data submitted by the sponsor, which includes clinical trial data (based on individual patient-level data from thousands of participants), to ensure that strict safety and efficacy thresholds are met. Expert advice from the Advisory Committee on Vaccines, an independent clinical expert committee, is also sought prior to a senior medical officer making a regulatory decision under the <span style="font-style:italic;">Therapeutic Goods Act 1989.</span></span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">A vaccine is only provisionally approved by the TGA if this rigorous process is completed, and the benefits of the vaccine are considered to be much greater than any potential risks. As part of the provisional approval, sponsors are also required to continue to submit longer-term evidence to the TGA.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The TGA has published a range of regulatory documents relating to the provisional approval of each COVID-19 vaccine. These include the Australian Public Assessment Report, the Product Information (Pl) and the Consumer Medicine Information documents, which are available at www.tga.gov.au/covid-19-vaccines.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The TGA also has a well-established and effective system in place to detect and investigate potential new safety issues relating to vaccines. Many of these processes have been enhanced dramatically for COVID-19 vaccines, making this the most intense safety monitoring of therapeutic goods ever conducted in Australia. Gathering adverse event reports is just the first step in determining whether a suspected side effect is related to the vaccine.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The TGA works closely with other regulators around the world and shares information from vaccination programs with reliable adverse events data covering hundreds of millions of people and continually analysing the latest evidence regarding COVID-19 vaccines. With vaccination programs being rolled out across the globe, regulators have access to enormous amounts of real-world data from a variety of sources to add to what we have learned from the initial clinical trials and subsequent follow-up studies.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Please be assured that when the TGA suspects there is a safety issue with a vaccine, they conduct a thorough investigation of the issue. If they determine that the safety concern is significant, they will respond appropriately. This can include updating information about recognised adverse effects in the approved Pl documents, used by vaccine administrators and other healthcare professionals and available on the TGA website. In addition, fortnightly updates are communicated to the public in the COVID-19 vaccine safety report at www.tga.gov.au/periodic/covid-19-vaccine-safety-report. More information can be found at www.tga.gov.au using the search terms 'COVID-19 vaccine safety monitoring and reporting'.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government has also invested in a diverse range of treatment options to ensure Australia has sufficient supply of COVID-19 treatments to manage different stages of disease, including:</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Ms Templeman</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 26 September 2022 to the Hon Dr Anne Aly MP, Minister for Early Childhood Education and Minister for Youth, regarding Petition EN4047 to include sexual consent education in the Australian Curriculum. As this matter falls within my portfolio responsibilities, your correspondence has been referred to me for reply.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In response to the issues raised in the petition, I can provide the following advice.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government has a zero-tolerance approach towards sexual assault and violence against children and young people. Respectful relationships education has been identified as a key long-term measure to change the attitudes of young people towards issues such as consent and healthy, safe relationships. This includes providing students and young people with the knowledge and skills to better communicate with one another, make responsible shared decisions, understand consent, resolve conflict, and engage in healthy and positive relationships.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The nationally agreed Foundation to Year 10 (F—10) Australian Curriculum sets the expectations for what all students should be taught, regardless of where they live or their background. The curriculum was reviewed by the Australian Curriculum, Assessment and Reporting Authority (ACARA) in 2020-22. Throughout the review, ACARA consulted with subject experts, teachers and the public regarding changes to the Health and Physical Education curriculum, including those related to consent. On 1 April 2022, all Education Ministers endorsed the revised Version 9.0 of the curriculum. Respectful relationships education is specifically embedded in the new Australian Curriculum and is available for jurisdictions to implement in schools from 2023.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The revised Health and Physical Education curriculum strengthens and lifts expectations for the delivery of consent and respectful relationships education. In this subject, students have the opportunity to develop the skills to build and manage respectful relationships, including understanding the concept of consent in age-appropriate ways starting from the Foundation year. The curriculum covers the area of relationships and sexuality, including respectful online relationships and online safety. The curriculum also sets out the General Capabilities of Ethical Understanding and Personal and Social Capability that provide opportunities for students to build their resilience, empathy and ability to resolve conflicts. More information on the Australian Curriculum Version 9.0 is available at v9.australiancurriculum.edu.au.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government plays a leadership role in setting and advocating for national priorities in school education. The Australian Government value the work that state and territory governments and non-government education authorities do to manage schools and implement the curriculum. This includes the development of policies for teaching respectful relationships, how the curriculum is implemented, and the selection and use of curriculum resources. In many cases, decisions are made by the individual schools which ensures that school leaders, teachers and communities can tailor education programs and resources to suit students' specific needs and their school's context.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government has announced a $77.6 million commitment to support state and territory governments and non-government school systems deliver respectful relationships and consent education in primary and secondary schools. These supports will be evidence based, age appropriate and developed by experts. This commitment will support the implementation of the Australian Curriculum.</span>

This is a non-compellable power and I am not obliged to consider a case or to intervene in a case.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your letter dated 27 September 2022 regarding petition EN3952 which requests that the Australian Government remove the kangaroo from the Commonwealth Coat of Arms.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Commonwealth Coat of Arms is the formal symbol of the Commonwealth of Australia and signifies Commonwealth authority and ownership. It is predominantly used by Australian Government departments and agencies, statutory and non-statutory authorities, the Parliament and Commonwealth courts and tribunals. The Government has no plans to change the Arms.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government takes the welfare of all animals, including native animals, seriously. Australian governments (state, territory and federal) work together to regulate and monitor kangaroo and wallaby sustainability and welfare. We remain committed to ensuring the management of kangaroos is science-based, sustainable and humane.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">State and territory governments have primary responsibility for managing kangaroos and other wildlife, including animal welfare. State government jurisdictions regularly undertake scientifically robust population monitoring to ensure kangaroo harvesting is sustainable. Harvest sites and numbers are actively managed where population resilience concerns arise.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">State and territory governments carry out commercial harvesting in accordance with the National Code of Practice for the Humane Shooting of Kangaroos and Wallabies for Commercial Purposes (the Code), which was updated in October 2020 and endorsed by key animal welfare organisations. The National Code of Practice for the Humane Shooting of Kangaroos and Wallabies for Non-commercial Purposes is used where animals are taken for non-commercial purposes.</span>

                <span style="font-style:italic;">
                </span>All state-managed harvest of kangaroos and wallabies for international export must have an approved Wildlife Trade Management Plan under the <span style="font-style:italic;">Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999.</span></span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Approved plans ensure commercial harvest is done sustainably and humanely, including in accordance with the Code. I note there has been no adverse long-term impacts on kangaroo populations after more than 40 years of harvesting under commercial management plans, including during periods of severe drought.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">I recognise that many Australians' lives and livelihoods continue to be affected by significant global challenges, including the COVID-19 pandemic. We know that we are better off in a world where rules and norms—whether on trade, the maritime domain, military engagement, the environment or human rights—are clear, mutually negotiated and consistently followed.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The UN, especially its network of specialised agencies, sets critical technical and normative standards that matter to Australians, such as those related to standardising measurements, postage services and telecommunications around the world. It is important Australia engages and shapes these standards.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We work closely with the global health community, including the World Health Organization, to improve health and wellbeing for all people worldwide. The International Health Regulations (2005) help ensure timely global responses to health emergencies, and are critical to minimising their health and economic impacts in Australia.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government has consistently condemned Russia's illegal and immoral invasion of Ukraine, including recently at the Crimea Platform Summit on 23 August 2022, and in Australia's national statement to the United Nations on 23 September 2022. I enclose both statements for your information.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is committed to supporting Ukraine and holding Russia accountable. Australia filed an intervention in Ukraine's case against Russia in the International Court of Justice (ICJ) on 30 September 2022. Australia joined 42 other states to refer the situation in Ukraine to the International Criminal Court (ICC) for investigation on 2 March 2022. The states requested that the Prosecutor investigate any war crimes, crimes against humanity or genocide alleged to have occurred in Ukraine from 21 November 2013. I consider Australia's existing contribution to and support for accountability processes, including the ICJ and ICC, offers the best prospects of ensuring Russia is held accountable.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">At the 1945 San Francisco Conference where the Charter was written, Evatt challenged the great powers. They wanted a strong Security Council that had control over the General Assembly.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dr Evatt did not succeed in his fight against the great powers' veto within the Security Council, but he did succeed in ensuring that the General Assembly has the ability to decide its own course, and can address any matter that falls within the UN Charter or the powers and functions of any of its organs.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">He understood that small and medium countries cannot simply allow their fates to be decided by the great powers.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">He understood that small and medium countries must be able to maintain their sovereign choices, protected by a stable framework of rules.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">And he understood that in order to maintain those sovereign choices, the small and medium countries of the world, including Australia, must work together.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dr Evatt also saw economic and social security as the precondition for peace.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">He pressed the San Francisco Conference to ensure the UN addresses the broadest range of social, economic and human rights issues, saying:</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">"Real stability… can only be achieved by building an organisation that will do its utmost to assure the peoples of the world a full opportunity in living in freedom from want as well as in freedom from external aggression."</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Some didn't want to extend the UN's ambit to economic and social development. On behalf of Australia, Evatt insisted.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">And again, these are legacies Australia renews today.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">This is a growing scale of human suffering that threatens untold global instability. Australia is increasing our contribution to development assistance by over a billion dollars.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia is resolved to these tasks, in all our diplomacy, in the UN and beyond. It is why we seek a seat on the UN Security Council for 2029-2030.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair </span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 7 September 2022 concerning petition number EN4056 regarding the Paid Parental Leave scheme.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is making changes to the Paid Parental Leave scheme to better support Australian families. As announced in the 2022-23 October Budget, the Paid Parental Leave scheme will be progressively expanded to 26 weeks by 2026. An additional two weeks of leave will be added each year from July 2024 to July 2026, increasing the overall length of the Paid Parental Leave scheme by six weeks. Parents will be able to share the entitlement, supporting them to better manage work and care arrangements.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government has also announced changes to the Paid Parental Leave scheme to expand access and make it more flexible to better support both parents to take time away from work to care for their children.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">From 1 July 2023, subject to the passage of legislation, Parental Leave Pay and Dad and Partner Pay will be combined into a single payment. Parents will be able to take paid leave days in blocks as small as one day, with periods of work in between, up until their child's second birthday. Two weeks will be reserved for each parent on a 'use it or lose it' basis, with parents able to choose how they share the remaining 16 weeks (single parents will be able to access the full 20 weeks). Both parents will be able to receive the Government payment in addition to any employer-provided leave.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government will also improve the claiming process so either parent can claim Parental Leave Pay first (currently the birth mother must claim first), removing assumptions about mothers and fathers being 'primary' or 'secondary' carers.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Further, access will be expanded through the introduction of a $350,000 family income test, which families can be assessed under if they do not meet the individual income test currently set at $156,657. This will particularly benefit women with incomes above $156,647 who are the primary income earners in their family, who are currently ineligible to access the scheme even if their partner has no or significantly lower income.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In addition, eligible fathers and partners will be able to access the Government payment where the mother does not meet the income test or the residency requirements, reducing barriers for fathers and partners to take time off work to care for their child.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you again for raising this matter with me.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Ms Templeman</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 27 September 2022 enclosing petition EN4064, with 373 signatures, concerning the Balance of Family Test (BoF) for Parent visas.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The BoF test is designed to be an objective test to determine the extent of a parent's link to Australia compared to any other country. It requires applicants to demonstrate that at least half of their children are lawfully and permanently resident in Australia or, alternatively, that more of their children reside lawfully and permanently in Australia than in any one single country overseas.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The BoF test determines the extent of the parent's links to their children or stepchildren and ensures only those with close ties to Australia are eligible for a Parent visa. It cannot be waived, even in compelling or exceptional circumstances. The BoF test operates solely on a numerical figure of 50 per cent because there are a limited number of places under the family stream of Australia's Migration Program and the Australian Government wants to ensure that these places are filled by people who have the strongest ties to Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Family migration is an important element of Australia's migration system, allowing Australian citizens and permanent residents to reunite with their family members and contributing to stronger social cohesion outcomes. However, at present, there is no intention to change these policy settings.</span>

MSAC advised that a new MBS item should be created to reinstate abdominoplasty with repair of rectus diastasis (separation of the large abdominal muscles) where the patient has an abdominal wall defect because of pregnancy. MSAC noted the strong, ongoing support from consumers and surgeons for reinstatement of Medicare funding for this procedure.

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="181810" type="MemberSpeech">

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate" style="&#xA;    font-family:;&#xA;  ">Macquarie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:01</span>):  This presentation includes several large petitions that draw attention to recent events in Iran and request the Australian government to take action in response.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Clearly this issue has been a matter of concern within Australia and around the world. For the petitioning process, petitions that attract interest from overseas can pose a challenge. The standing orders require that all signatories to petitions are either citizens or residents of Australia. To sign a petition—either in paper or via our website—a signatory has to declare that they are a citizen or resident of Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In its inquiry in the last parliament into petitioning security and accessibility, the previous committee considered how best to enforce this requirement. The inquiry looked at whether more active identity-verification methods should be introduced, such as crosschecking with official records like the electorate roll.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After consideration, the committee decided that using additional verification would unreasonably limit accessibility. The committee's view was that self-declaration was the right balance between compliance and allowing anyone who wishes to petition the parliament to easily do so.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On occasion, the committee will report to the House on petitions that may have some invalid signatures. One way of testing this is by reviewing the IP addresses of signatories. This is not a fail-safe method, as you can be a citizen or resident of Australia and be overseas, or in Australia and using a private network.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the case of the petitions presented today, there are an unusually high number of non-Australian IP addresses. Despite this, after consideration the committee is satisfied that there is a genuine intention to petition, that most of the signatures are compliant and that the matters raised in the petitions warrant a ministerial response. However, the committee would like to draw the attention of the House to the possibility of noncompliant signatures and will continue to monitor this issue in the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd also like to note that present in the chamber are the members for Bennelong, Kooyong and Menzies, who all have a deep interest in the petition on the events in Iran that I'm tabling today.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">The SPEAKER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Time">10:04</span>):  I am pleased to present the report of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation that participated in the 145th Inter-Parliamentary Union Assembly held in Kigali, Rwanda, from 11 October to 15 October 2022. It was a great honour and privilege to lead this delegation. Travelling alongside me as part of this Australian delegation were: Senator the Hon. Linda Reynolds CSC; the member for Leichhardt, the Hon. Warren Entsch; Senator Fatima Payman; and the member for Robertson, Dr Gordon Reid. This delegation reflected the diversity of the 47th Parliament, which is fundamental and in line with the overall theme of the assembly: gender equality and gender-sensitive parliaments as drivers for a more resilient and peaceful world. All members of the delegation played an active and vital role at various proceedings of the assembly. The delegation attended the formal sessions and participated in the governing council. The delegation also participated in the meetings of the Asia-Pacific and Twelve-Plus geopolitical groups as well as the Forum of Women Parliamentarians and the various standing committees. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">During the assembly I contributed to the general debate on the topic of gender equality and gender-sensitive parliaments as drivers for a more resilient and peaceful world. I drew attention to the reforms underway within the Australian parliament and how we are working towards a safer, more supportive and gender-sensitive workplace. I stated that we have an obligation, as the Australian parliament and a workplace, to ensure our working environment is respectful and allows parliamentarians and those who support them to perform at their best on behalf of the nation. I also participated in the emergency item on the condemnation of the invasion of Ukraine and of the subsequent annexation of territories in defence of the territorial integrity of all states. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Payman made her contribution as a young parliamentarian on behalf of the Australian delegation. She spoke of the importance of addressing the barriers that prevent young women from recognising politics as a legitimate career option. The delegation participated in all meetings of the two geopolitical groups that Australia is a member of, the Asia-Pacific group and the Twelve-Plus group. During the consideration of the emergency item in the Twelve-Plus group, Senator Reynolds and I contributed to the debate, voicing our strong support for the solidarity with Ukraine. The group also considered a proposal, prepared by the Swiss delegation, to improve the implementation of IPU resolutions. I congratulate and thank Senator Reynolds who will serve on a task force with Switzerland to consider and advance the proposal. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia put forward a proposal regarding measures to combat orphan trafficking and tourism, which was accepted for consideration by the Standing Committee on Democracy and Human Rights. This proposal will be put forward as a resolution to the committee for debate at the 146th IPU Assembly in Bahrain in March 2023 and for subsequent adoption of the 140th Assembly in October 2023. The Forum of Young Parliamentarians met to receive an update on youth participating nationally and internationally. Senator Payman, the fifth-youngest senator in Australian history and youngest and in the current parliament, made the I Say Yes to Youth in Parliament! pledge, along with me and other members of the delegation. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the benefits of the assembly is that it provides an opportunity for Australian parliamentarians to meet their international colleagues in both formal and informal settings. It offers a unique opportunity for delegations and individual parliamentarians to discuss issues of mutual interest, to develop an understanding of different parliamentary models and to strengthen parliament-to-parliament relationships. For these reasons, during our time at the assembly, the Australian delegation met with delegations from New Zealand, Fiji, Timor-Leste, Canada and Britain. We also held bilateral meetings with delegations from Afghanistan, Georgia and Serbia. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On behalf of the Australian delegation, I'd like to make a few acknowledgements: firstly, the support provided by Mr Dominique Vigie at the Australian High Commission in Nairobi, Kenya; secondly, the work of the staff at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade in Canberra who provided background briefing materials, including Mr Greg Klemm and Jennifer Grouch who coordinated the provision of the materials. I extend our thanks to the Parliamentary Library who also provided important briefing materials to the delegations, which were extremely helpful and informative. I acknowledge the work of Mr Nigel Brew and his colleagues of the Parliamentary Library for providing this material and thank them for it. The delegation deeply appreciated the assistance and support of the International and Parliamentary Relations Office, with Ms Aleshia Westgate and Kim Bulman deserving special mention for their tireless efforts to arrange travel and accommodations. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, the delegation would like to acknowledge and thank Ms Toni Matulick and Dr Jane Thomson from the Department of the Senate, Clerk Assistant Committees who served as delegation secretary for this delegation. I commend the report to the House.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Fuel and Vehicle Standards Legislation Amendment (Reducing Vehicle Pollution) Bill 2022 that I am introducing today legislates much-needed standards to improve the quality of cars on our roads, reduce transport emissions and help bring down fuel costs for Australian motorists.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now as some of you may know, I am a mechanic's daughter who grew up around engines in the small town of Coonabarabran. My first car was a 1969 Toyota Corolla Sprinter, which I bought in 1986 for $500 and rebuilt with my dad. I loved that car, but I find it truly concerning that under current regulations, it is still on the road today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But this is the reality of the car market and consumer behaviour. It is currently estimated that there are over 20 million motor vehicles in Australia that are powered by internal combustion engines. Even with a rapid acceleration towards the uptake of electric vehicles, millions of Australians will be driving petrol cars on our roads for many years to come. We need to make these engines as clean, efficient and cost effective as we can for our community and our motorists.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">North Sydney is home to one of the most polluted stretches of road in the country. Internal combustion engines driving on the motorway that runs through my community produce noxious emissions—with particulate matter, carbon monoxide and oxides of sulphur and nitrogen—and these emissions are making us sick.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This pollution can cause heart and lung disease and cancer, with an estimated 620 Australians having died in 2015 because of transport related air pollution. This is nearly twice the number of people who tragically died on New South Wales roads in the same time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">According to a recent report, <span style="font-style:italic;">Cleaner and Safer Roads for NSW</span>, emissions from internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles in the Sydney-Newcastle-Wollongong area alone create $3 billion in health costs every year. Fifty-two per cent of that pollution comes from exhaust emissions, while the remainder comes from non-exhaust emissions such as tire and brake wear.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Children are especially sensitive to air pollution due to their immature capacity to detoxify a pollutant load. Vehicle pollution is particularly significant when it comes to children's asthma, with children living within 75 metres of a major road having a 29 per cent increased risk of lifetime asthma.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We often see schools built on main roads to increase accessibility, increasing exposure to asthma risk factors.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our inadequate regulation of fuel quality not only is a health risk for our communities but has also turned Australia into what car manufacturers have described as a 'dumping ground' for old cars.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Compared to our international peers, we are driving less efficient cars, which are running on less efficient fuel, which in turn means that households have to buy more petrol to get from A to B.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2016, the Turnbull government's Ministerial Forum on Vehicle Emissions found that adopting Euro 6 standards would have saved the average Australian household over $500 a year in petrol costs—potential savings that would be even greater today, given current petrol prices.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Improving our fuel quality is an incredibly important lever in bringing down the carbon emissions from our transport sector, given internal combustion engines still comprise 99.7 per cent of all Australian road traffic. Light vehicles account for around 11 per cent of Australia's greenhouse gas emissions. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Change is long overdue.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Vehicles that meet a higher air pollution standard, referred to as a Euro level, produce less air pollutants than equivalent vehicles meeting a lower standard. This bill will update the Fuel Quality Standards Act 2000 and Fuel Quality Standards Regulation 2019 to bring these in line with Euro 6d, so that petrol in Australia has no more than 10 parts per million of sulphur and 35 per cent aromatics by 2024. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the same time, the bill will also update Australian Design Rule 79/04 to require light vehicles to meet Euro 6d standards, with changes coming into effect immediately for diesel vehicles, and around 2024/2025 for petrol cars. This is a realistic time frame that pushes car makers to bring modern, more efficient models to the Australian market when we have the fuel to support them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Euro 6d is already used by 80 per cent of the car market globally. Without it, Australians currently put up with some of the dirtiest petrol in the world, with up to 15 times the levels of cancerous sulphur than in Europe and Japan. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As we all know, technology is constantly improving. That's why it's also important to have the legislation provide a lock-step mechanism with the world's best standards to ensure Australia remains internationally competitive. We don't want to be left behind again when the world starts moving to Euro 7 standards in 2025.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Together, these changes will improve the fuel economy of all new and existing internal combustion engine vehicles in Australia. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While I have tabled this as a private members bill on behalf of the people of North Sydney, it has been designed to support changes that the wider Australian public, and many in this chamber, have already said they want to see. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some members of the opposition will also have been a part of the 2015 Ministerial Forum on Vehicle Emissions, which also considered introducing fuel efficiency standards and Euro 6. I look forward to hearing your thoughts on this bill and working together constructively towards progress.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Overall, this is a pragmatic and effective way for Australia to clean up our cars. We're improving the quality of fuel that goes into them, reducing the noxious emissions that comes out of them, and driving down carbon emissions. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a win for consumers and communities who will benefit from lower fuel costs, better health outcomes across Australia and particularly in high-traffic areas like my electorate of North Sydney, and a wider range of new car models to choose from.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a win for the automotive industry, which will benefit from clearer regulations and fuel quality that is more consistent with the standards they are experiencing overseas.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Curtin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:18</span>):  I second the member for North Sydney's Fuel and Vehicle Standards Legislation Amendment (Reducing Vehicle Pollution) Bill 2022. This bill does two things. It improves our fuel standards so that our cars will run on better fuel that has lower sulphur and aromatics, in line with other countries, and it ensures that our vehicle emissions standards don't fall behind international standards in future. There are three main impacts of this bill. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Firstly, there are the health benefits of having better quality fuel. As the member for North Sydney has pointed out, an estimated 620 Australians died because of transport related air pollution in Australia in 2015. Improving our fuel quality will reduce this number. People don't think about the health cost of fuel when making decisions about which fuel to buy. This needs to be addressed through regulation so everyone can benefit. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, keeping up with international standards on fuel quality will mean more advanced vehicles are more likely to be imported to Australia. This is because, separate to fuel standards, we have vehicle standards which set limits for emissions for new road vehicles supplied to Australia. The limit currently used in Australia is referred to as Euro 5. Eighty per cent of countries have moved to Euro 6 and are planning a move to Euro 7. Australia is being left behind. At the moment, vehicles that comply with Euro 6 are designed for better quality fuel than we have in Australia, so they're imported to countries with better quality fuel. Manufacturers don't want to take the risk that these vehicles will not operate as efficiently as promised with our lower-quality fuel, so they send them to where they'll operate best and where there's demand. Increasing the importation of more-advanced vehicles will mean lower carbon emissions, better safety features and, ultimately, lower cost to drivers because they're more efficient.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill links our vehicle emission standards to European standards to ensure that we avoid being left behind as other countries move to Euro 7 in the future. I acknowledge that last month the government started the work on updating our vehicle emission standards by commencing a department of infrastructure consultation. This is a welcome start, but the options canvassed don't include an option to stay in line with future improvements in international standards. Even if Euro 6 is mandated for all new vehicles, we risk being left behind as the world moves to Euro 7. Pegging our standards to global standards will stop Australia from inadvertently being a laggard on emissions and vehicle efficiency. I support the member for North Sydney in her call for better fuel quality and maintaining vehicle emission standards in line with the rest of the world.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While my continuing campaign to call out the bad behaviour of the gambling industry is well known, today I want to sound the alarm about an insidious gateway to gambling that's being widely used to target our kids.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And that's what they call loot boxes, which is a video game feature where players pay to chance their luck at winning additional virtual assets to use during the game. This is gambling by any definition and is routinely being experienced by children and adolescents right around Australia. No wonder gambling companies are buying up online gaming companies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In other words the outlay of money, an element of chance or risk, a tantalising prize and the psychological thrill of the anticipation—these are all features most people associate with poker machines or casino games, surely not with the games our children are playing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But, despite researchers warning that these craftily created features are 'structurally and psychologically akin to gambling', they are still not being properly regulated.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And that's why today I'm introducing my Classification (Publications, Films and Computer Games) Amendment (Loot Boxes) Bill 2022,<span style="font-style:italic;"></span>which<span style="font-style:italic;"></span>aims to regulate how computer, video and online games that contain these loot boxes are classified.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In essence the bill requires the Classification Board to consider loot boxes when classifying a game, and to set a minimum classification of R18+ or RC for games containing this feature in line with the fact that you must be 18 to legally gamble in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments also require a warning to be displayed when games contain loot-box-type mechanisms. This means young people will be restricted from buying and playing games with these features, and parents will be able to easily identify when these rather surreptitious tactics are included in gameplay.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Many parents may not know that loot boxes feature in games such as <span style="font-style:italic;">Star Wars</span>, <span style="font-style:italic;">Call of Duty</span>, <span style="font-style:italic;">FIFA</span> and even <span style="font-style:italic;">Mario Kart</span>. Indeed research by the Australian Gaming Council found 62 per cent of the bestselling games contained loot boxes, and that all young people surveyed had played a game featuring loot boxes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Disturbingly, the study also revealed that young people who had used loot boxes were more likely to have gambled in the last 12 months, gambled more frequently, spent more money gambling and suffered more gambling problems.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And those who played games with loot boxes alarmingly tended to have more positive attitudes towards gambling. This is consistent with the findings of the study, published in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Royal Society Open Science </span>journal in August 2022, which surveyed more than 2,700 participants who bought video game loot boxes and uncovered a strong link between their purchase and problem gambling.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">No wonder, when I flagged my intention to introduce this bill during the previous parliament, I was hit by a cascade of concern from the community, especially from parents who've watched their children succumb to addiction because of loot-box features in certain games. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One mother told me about her then 17-year-old son spending $3½ thousand in just eight weeks on loot boxes. He could not hold down a job because of his gaming addiction. Now, almost 24, her son still spends money on the online gaming platform Steam, at times haemorrhaging hundreds of dollars a day. The family, she says, has been through hell.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To use her words: 'What people don't understand is the brain of a gamer is exactly the same as that of a heroin addict. It's no different, it's a dopamine hit. Gaming companies employ experts to work with them to ensure that their games grab people's attention. The first levels are easy, then the gamer gets hooked and they want to go further.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">'So the game throws up incentives, or loot boxes, to help the gamer get past that level that has stumped them for the past week, such as, "Buy this gun and you will get more points and be higher in the game; leave your "friends" now to go and have dinner and you will let your team down and they won't want you to play with them again." These companies are very smart and are making billions and it's wrong.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Clearly we cannot continue to let our children to be groomed for future gambling in this way. No wonder governments around the world are beginning to wise up and take action, with loot boxes already banned in several countries as pressure rises for regulation in many others. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">By tempting young players with the potential-to-win game-changing items, encouraging risk-taking behaviour for a possible reward, delivering random prizes on an intermittent basis and encouraging them to keep spending money, it's clear that loot boxes give rise to many of the same emotions and experiences associated with poker machines and other traditional gambling activities. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This problem has been on the radar of the parliament for many years, and it's time we did something about it. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed, two Senate inquiries, in 2018 and 2020, found that loot boxes meet the 'the five established psychological criteria for gambling', and recommended the department of communications undertake a review of their use, and the eSafety Commissioner report on options to restrict their sale in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And now the Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs is again looking at this. I look forward to reading the committee's final report, but I urge the government to act on this as a matter of urgency.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do commend the former minister for communications, Paul Fletcher, for the previous government's commitment to require mandatory age classifications and warnings. And I note that the current communications minister, Michelle Rowland, has sought advice on whether further regulation is required. So I urge the government to take note of the research that has already been done as well as the compelling evidence that continues to emerge and to support this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The evidence is clear. The government needs to step up and regulate these practices so young people aren't exposed to these insidious gambling tactics within their video games. The potential for long-term harm is undeniable. The changes proposed in my bill will go a long way to ensuring this predatory in-game behaviour is no longer allowed to continue unchecked. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend the bill to the House.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And in my remaining time I invite the member for Fisher, who is seconding the bill, to make some remarks. I take from him seconding the bill and hope that the opposition will also support my private member's bill.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fisher</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:28</span>):  I second the bill. During my time as Chair of the Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs, I led an inquiry into age verification for online wagering and online pornography, producing the <span style="font-style:italic;">P</span><span style="font-style:italic;">rotecting the </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Age of I</span><span style="font-style:italic;">nnocence </span>report. We called for urgent action to 'protect children from gambling-like incentives used by tech giants and video game creators to generate microtransactions for chance-based, mystery virtual items'. As I said then, these exploitative and deceptive in-game purchases have created a global billion-dollar industry at the expense of our youth—and, it has to be said, for their families.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the member for Clark has pointed out, in August, a study into loot boxes found that there is a strong correlation between loot box and gaming purchases and problem gambling. The coalition has continually fought to keep kids safe online, including in the face of growing big tech and social media influence. It was often said, when we were in government, that you shouldn't be able to do online what you can't do online in the real world. Children under the age of 18 can't walk into an RSL and play the pokies. They can't walk into a TAB and put a bet on a horserace, and yet these loot boxes are effectively a form of gambling that is being delivered to young people's homes, into their bedrooms and living rooms.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm very pleased that when we were in government—thanks to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Protecting </span><span style="font-style:italic;">the age of innocence </span>report and the work that we undertook as a committee—we were able to secure a commitment for mandatory age classifications from the then communications minister, and we took a number of steps to empower the eSafety Commissioner to tackle these issues. Unfortunately, the election got in the way, as it has with many things, but, as they say, that's life in a democracy. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This measure is a step in the right direction, and I want to commend the member for Clark. We have our differences on many things, but the member for Clark has been an absolute strident champion in his desire to clean up the gambling industry—as have I. We stand shoulder to shoulder in this place to put big tech and the big gambling companies on notice that he and I, and anyone who wants to join us, will fight shoulder to shoulder to protect Australians who have become vulnerable to gambling.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm not advocating for gambling to be made illegal—I won't speak for the member Clark; that would be inappropriate—but there is so much that we need to do in this place to protect vulnerable Australians. Yes, it's uncomfortable for some people. Yes, it's uncomfortable for parties. But together we can do this. It is a sensible start to introduce this bill to introduce age classifications, something that will protect our most vulnerable. I support the bill, and I congratulate the member for Clark for bringing it to the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mayo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:39</span>):  I second the motion and wholeheartedly support this bill moved by the member for Warringah, the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment (Stop the Lies) Bill 2022. Back in the eighties for a very short period of time we had federal truth in political advertising laws. Oh, the halcyon days of politics! At the time, the newly elected Hawke government moved the Commonwealth Electoral Legislation Amendment Bill 1983, and it was passed in 1983. The amendments made the publication of electoral advertising that were untrue, misleading or deceptive an offence punishable by six-months imprisonment or a fine. But, in true bipartisan nature, this act was abolished just a year later because it couldn't even stand the test of an election.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to reflect on the proud history in my home state. The South Australia Electoral Act 1985, to which the member for Warringah referred, prohibits inaccurate and misleading statements of fact in electoral advertising. The SA Electoral Commissioner can require an advertiser to withdraw or retract an offending advertisement. While it has not put an end to all of the dirty tricks and game playing that happens in campaigns completely, it has resulted in 313 complaints and 25 retraction requests relating to the electoral advertising between 1997 and 2018. The SA provision has withstood scrutiny, in Cameron v Becker, and is considered effective and valid. Indeed, the Australian Capital Territory modelled their own legislation on the South Australian act. It can be done, even here in Canberra.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Consumer Law requires that businesses do not engage in misleading or deceptive conduct which could lead another person into error. There is no tolerance for fake advertising about business products, but in federal parliament, in the federal political sphere, anything goes. False advertising in politics is not harmless puff. I should know, having been targeted by a false campaign during the 2022 election, as I'm sure many in this chamber have. I was fortunate that, in my case, most of my constituents could smell a rat, but my electorate was not the only one targeted. The Australian Institute 2022 federal election exit poll found that 73 per cent of voters encountered misleading political advertisements during the election campaign.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Allowing false electoral advertising to becoming increasingly pervasive with no checks and balances will create a free for all. It will be used to manipulate and mislead, and we really don't need that. We need to improve trust in politics and trust in political institutions. In this post-truth era for deepfakes and misinformation, the need for federal legislation such as the stop the lies bill is becoming increasingly pressing. I call on all members to debate this bill. Let's go back to 1983 and let's make it stick. I commend this bill to the House.</span>

Later this morning we'll be dealing with legislation to make workplaces safer and more secure for Australian women, something that I'm very proud this government is working towards for every woman across this country. I want to commend Senator Gallagher for her leadership in the portfolio, as Minister for Women, and for getting this piece of legislation through both houses of parliament to ensure that our workplaces are safe for women—that women are free from harassment in the workplace. As well, I commend the work that is going on in this parliament through committee structures, like the Joint Select Committee on Parliamentary Standards, and behind the scenes to ensure that this place is held in the highest esteem and that every woman—every person—who works in this building does so in a safe and secure environment.</span>

We're looking forward to the next tranche of changes that Labor will bring in to make a fairer and better country—to ensure that workers around the country are safe, that businesses thrive and that we have an economy that works for people and with people. It is an absolute pleasure to have been returned as the member for Lalor in this place and to represent my community. I'm really looking forward to the next few years of working with the state Labor government in Victoria to deliver for my electorate both federally and with my state colleagues. It really is humbling to be in government and to be able to deliver the change. The old saying, 'Governments change lives,' is absolutely true.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="176304" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr STEVENS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Sturt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:48</span>):  I rise to speak on the government's motion congratulating themselves on how good they are. Of course, I don't necessarily agree with that premise, so in the short time I've got I want to make three points. Firstly, there's nothing impressive in a government implementing promises that it took to an election—that's an expectation. If the bar is now so low that the government think they need to move a motion of self-congratulation on the things they took to the election, which they promised the people of this country they would do and have merely proceeded to implement, then I think they need to learn to be a bit better than that at impressing people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, of course, the more concerning thing is what they've done since the election that they didn't tell the people of Australia they would do during the election campaign. The member talked about industrial relations reform, and it's staggering to me that, of the reforms that the government are putting in place through this legislation that the member touched on in her contribution, many of the core elements were not talked about whatsoever during the election campaign. If these reforms were so important, so vital and going to be so good for the people of this country, I'm truly shocked as to why they weren't front and centre of the Labor Party's election campaign to win government back in May. One wonders very deeply why it is that all these things that are going to apparently be good for the economy, dramatically increase wages and lead the Australian workers to the land of milk and honey were not points that they thought would be relevant to prosecute during an election campaign to help them win an election. Frankly, if this legislation on industrial relations is going to be so good for the people of Australia, that was a dramatically missed opportunity for the Labor Party to win a lot more votes than they did back in May, if their claims are that this legislation is so popular and going to be so good for the workers of this country are true.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One suspects, therefore, that the geniuses in the Labor Party campaign strategy team were not confident whatsoever that the people of Australia wanted these industrial relations reforms that are being rammed through this parliament right now. If there were any value to the claims that the government make about them as far as their benefit to the economy and their benefit to workers, then of course they would've prosecuted that in the election campaign. In fact it would've be front and centre of what they had as their argument for government. But multi-employer bargaining and a whole range of other things that are being rammed through this parliament in the final sitting week of the year were not talked about by the now government whatsoever in the election campaign. That is regrettable, and it's a breach of faith with the people of this country—that you had a secret plan, clearly, to implement reforms that you're so embarrassed about that you wouldn't talk about them during the election campaign, because you're repaying the union movement for the donations they gave you during the election. That's the reality of what's happening with that reform, we all know it and, unfortunately, we're all going to see the economic impact of those reforms if that does pass through this parliament week.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, the thing that's missing from this motion is what the government isn't doing, which is taking any action whatsoever to assist households and businesses in this country to address the dramatic and crippling challenges of inflation and costs of living spiralling out of control. They've confirmed there's a huge problem. They said in their budget that electricity prices alone are going to increase over 56 per cent over the next two years. They handed down a budget and said, 'Electricity prices are going up by 56 per cent, and we're also going to do absolutely nothing about it.' That is what the budget was, 'Here's a problem, and no solution from your federal government.' How appalling. What a disgrace. The households and businesses of this country are now left in a very concerning predicament of having to plan for those challenges and a whole range of other cost-of-living challenges that keep on getting worse and worse as the economic data is released day after day, week after week. We don't want to see inflation spiralling out of control in this country, but the reality is the budget says it's climbing to at least eight per cent—so, inflation at eight per cent, electricity prices up 56 per cent, gas over 40 per cent. We all know how difficult it has been at the petrol pump and in the grocery stores of late, and that's the first responsibility of this government, to help people make ends meet. They're doing absolutely nothing about that. So, they can congratulate themselves on implementing changes they never told the people of this country about during the election. But they should focus on the things that matter, and that starts with addressing the cost-of-living crisis we have in this country.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr LIM</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tangney</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:54</span>):  I would like to thank the member for Lalor for moving the motion. I'm so proud to stand before you today as a member of the Albanese Labor government, one of the most diverse federal governments in Australian history. I'm proud to stand with a government that has a strong representation of women, that is inclusive and that welcomes different backgrounds, cultures, religions and experiences. I'm proud to stand with a government that is getting the job done. There are many changes that the Albanese Labor government have implemented in the last six months. I want to discuss three of these changes, because these changes have the most impact on my constituents, the people of Tangney. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The first is clearing the coalition visa blockage, the big backlog. Every day, my office receives many calls from people who are suffering at the hands of the previous government's cruel visa system. These people are wracked with anxiety. They are people who have not seen, heard or touched their loved ones for several years and who are not sure when they will get an opportunity to embrace them. They are people who do not know if they will be deported in a matter of hours, people who are crying, people who are hurt, people who are traumatised. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My staff, like me, have big hearts. We've worked very hard to help people in this painful situation. I have lost count of the number of constituents who have come into my office—to thank me and my staff—in tears of relief, hugging us for hearing their sufferings, for extending kindness, humility and empathy. I want to personally thank Prime Minister Anthony Albanese for his compassionate leadership, in understanding the importance of clearing the coalition visa backlog, and Minister Andrew Giles for his tireless hard work. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The second change I want to speak about is the introduction of legislation to establish a National Anti-Corruption Commission. This is long overdue. The people of Australia rightfully demand integrity and trust in our national institutions. This trust was eroded through nine years of coalition governments, including a government that saw Prime Minister Scott Morrison secretly appoint himself to several ministries. The people of Australia demand better, The people of Australia deserve better, and an Albanese Labor government is delivering. I'm honoured to serve as a committee member of the National Anti-Corruption Commission, and I have played a role in introducing this crucial bill. It is my privilege to utilise my extensive background in law and order as a police officer throughout the process. Thank you, Mark Dreyfus, for the opportunity. There is more work to be done, and I look forward to continuing our work together. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Lastly, I would like to speak about another policy, that the Albanese Labor government has enacted, that is having a real effect on our older Australians. Our older Australians deserve dignity, care, security and respect. Under the previous government, many of our cherished elders were not being granted fundamental human decencies, and an Albanese government made fixing this mess a priority. We have implemented a pay rise for aged-care workers. We have put nurses back in nursing homes 24/7. We have lifted income limits for the Commonwealth Seniors Health Card. An Albanese Labor government has also made Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme medicines cheaper, the first time this has happened in 75 years. In addition, we have supported an increase to the pension. This is the biggest increase to the pension in 30 years. I am proud to stand behind this achievement. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am proud to stand beside a team, the Albanese Labor government, that is building a better future for Australians. There is more work to be done, and I look forward to standing before the people of Tangney as we see local election commitments come to fruition. I thank members of parliament for getting the job done, and I thank the people of Australia for keeping us accountable. We will not waste a day. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PIKE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bowman</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:59</span>):  The motion calls on us to note the achievements of the new Labor government over the last six months. Listening to those opposite, you would think that they'd overseen a great golden age for our nation. But the sad truth is that Australia is facing soaring interest rates, higher energy prices, higher gas prices, a decline in real wages, slowing GDP growth and rising inflation. Unfortunately, the government is offering no plans to remedy those issues and certainly is offering no relief. We've seen nothing over the first six months of this government that will address the very real concerns for those back in my electorate and across this country, yet the government wants us to spend time in this final sitting week of parliament for the year to acknowledge their greatness. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's have a look at some of the aspects of this motion. Firstly, there's a set of categories of things listed in this motion that I refer to as copycat policies. These are things that the previous government was implementing or had proposed that were copied by the now government, and I certainly don't hold it against them for copying good ideas. I think that's something that we should do more of in this chamber, so let me run through a few of them. Firstly, we have the claim that they're delivering cheaper medicines. The general co-payment bill cuts the PBS charge by $12.50, and that's of course a policy that was introduced in response to the coalition committing to reduce it by $10. As part of our record in government, the coalition listed more than 2,800 new and amended medicines on the PBS, and that's almost 30 new medicines every month. There's certainly no sign that Labor will have such a positive impact on the sector over the long term. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The motion seeks our support for the government's 10-day paid family and domestic violence leave, which of course mimics what the coalition did back in 2018 in taking a Fair Work Commission recommendation and ensuring it applies to everyone. Once again, it's good to see the government following the coalition's lead. The motion calls for us to acknowledge the expansion of access to the Commonwealth seniors health card, and credit where credit's due. The legislation tabled regarding the Commonwealth seniors health card is actually positive legislation. However, this is no surprise for one simple reason: it was a coalition election commitment that the Labor Party subsequently decided to match. Yet again, the government's most of effective policies, the things they've had success with, have proved to be those campaigned for by the coalition. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, we have to go from the good to the bad and the ugly. I've heard previous speakers make mention of the repeal of the cashless debit card. Has there been anything this government has attempted that could be more disgraceful than that action? They are opening the door to greater violence and abuse in the communities where the cashless debit card has had such a successful introduction. They ran a horrendous scare campaign during the election, trying to claim that the coalition government was going to impose this on senior welfare payments. It was certainly something that was raised a lot in my electorate during the campaign, but luckily not many of the voters believed them. I'm often surprised by Labor's enthusiasm on removing the cashless debit card because we've seen it work. The feedback on the ground is that it works, and I don't understand what demographic the Labor Party think they're appealing to with this move. But it certainly isn't the demographic in these communities where the cashless debit card is having such a positive impact. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another thing that's mentioned in this motion is the secure jobs and better pay bill. Has a new government ever faced such a united chorus of opposition to a bill in their first six months? This is a direct attack on small businesses in my electorate and across the country, and it's an absolutely blatant attempt to give the unions some increased relevance as we go deeper into the 21st century. But the problem is that they are now in government, and they'll have to come up with their own ideas. It will be things like the IR bill that we'll see more of, which is where the trouble will begin. The motion calls for us to acknowledge the government are delivering on their election commitments. In response to that all I would say is: where is their honouring of the election commitment for a $275 reduction to household energy bills? My constituents are waiting for that. My message to the government members is that, if they think it is a solid record of achievement over six months, good luck to them. They have a long way to go. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="147140" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs PHILLIPS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gilmore</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:04</span>):  I am delighted to support the member for Lalor's motion today, acknowledging the remarkable achievements of the Albanese government in just six months. We have gone hell for leather, initiating the reforms that people in my electorate on the New South Wales South Coast voted for—the reforms that our country deserves.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We started on day one with reforms to fix our broken aged-care system. We said we would put the care back into aged care. We promised 24/7 nurses in aged-care homes. We promised to end the decade of neglect under the Liberal government. On our very first day of government in this place we introduced the bill to do just that, and now it is the law. On top of that, we have also delivered a long-overdue pay rise for aged-care workers so that we can encourage more people into this vital sector and ensure that our aged-care workers are paid fairly for the incredible work they do. That is a significant achievement in itself, but it is just the beginning.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I often talk about the improvements this government has made for pensioners, but, with one of the highest rates of pensioners in Australia, that is no surprise. Pensioners on the South Coast are benefiting from their biggest pay rise in more than 12 years and the biggest increase to allowances in three decades. That is money already in local people's pockets because we wasted no time. We have also supported self-funded retirees by increasing the income threshold for the Commonwealth seniors health care card, meaning more people can now access cheaper medicines. If that's not enough, we have also brought down the price of prescriptions on the PBS by 29 per cent and added more to the list so that local people can afford the medicines they need.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is making cost-of-living improvements for people across the country. We are supporting families, because we know it is good for our country and good for the economy. In our six months in government, we have passed laws to deliver cheaper child care for around 4,800 local families in my electorate. We have increased paid parental leave to 26 weeks per year and delivered universal family and domestic violence leave—10 paid days leave. And we have delivered a historic rise in the minimum wage.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a former TAFE teacher, I know how important a good education is. So I am so pleased we are delivering free TAFE places and more university places in areas of skills shortage.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The South Coast is experiencing an escalating housing crisis that the former government watched spiral out of control. Just last week, the Minister for Housing released $575 million in funding to allow the National Housing Infrastructure Facility to deliver social and affordable housing, getting us one step closer to building 40,000 new social and affordable homes. Our Regional First Home Buyer Guarantee is already open, giving first home buyers in regional areas a government guarantee of up to 15 per cent. One thousand first home buyers have already taken advantage of this. Turning our housing crisis around will be a long-term project, but we are wasting no time in getting started.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My electorate has a large defence and veteran population, so I am delighted that, just last week, we passed laws to help our Australian Defence Force members and veterans buy their own home. The $46.2 million expansion of the Defence Home Ownership Assistance Scheme will see more veterans and ADF members become eligible for the scheme, helping more people in my electorate get into a home sooner. Not only that, but last week also saw laws passed to improve support for totally and permanently incapacitated veterans from 1 January 2023. These well-deserving veterans, who have put their lives on the line for our freedom, will receive a $1,000 annual increase to their rate of pension, benefiting 27,000 veterans and their families around Australia. We're also delivering a veterans employment strategy and responding to all the recommendations put forward by the Royal Commission into Defence and Veteran Suicide.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government promised we would help with the cost of living, take meaningful action on climate change and support our renewables transition. We promised to help communities impacted by disaster by investing in resilience and preparedness through the Disaster Ready Fund. And we promised to advance a Voice to Parliament. We have delivered on all of these commitments and more, in just six months. This is only a small snippet of the incredible nation-building reform this government has delivered so far. We are building a better future for all Australians, and I couldn't be prouder to be part of this amazing team.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr SUKKAR</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Deakin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:09</span>):  I must say, in this parliament there are few things more cringe-worthy than a pat-on-the-back style of motion like this from the government—a motion that says: 'Look how good we are!' and 'Look what amazing things we've done over the last six months!' I say to members opposite and to the member who moved this motion that these sorts of aren't-we-good, let's-pat-ourselves-on-the-back motions are completely disconnected from the feelings of many in the community. There is the litany of broken promises and the most significant failure of this government on the economy. I can assure you that this how-good-are-we motion does not resonate out there.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government failed the biggest test. We heard before the election that, if they won, shortly after the election they would have a budget that would set out their agenda. We saw the budget spoken about for about one day and then they moved on. They went out to sell the budget the morning after the budget and they got a bit of a reaction from the Australian public, who said: 'This thing is a stinker. This thing is a shocker.' We have scarcely heard about the budget since that morning.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Quite frankly, it was a budget that was able to do a few things quite remarkably. Get a group of year 12 students or a group of economics 101 university students together and ask them: 'What's the one thing you wouldn't do in an environment of high inflation? What's the one thing you wouldn't do?' You wouldn't pour fuel on the fire of that inflation, putting more pressure on inflation, putting more pressure on mortgage rates and, therefore, putting more pressure on families.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What did this budget do? It ran a larger budget deficit than the year before, which was in the middle of the pandemic. In the middle of the pandemic we ran a budget deficit of $32 billion—quite rightly—to deliver the support that Australians needed at that crucial time. Yet in a year where we have elevated and rising inflation we have a budget deficit higher. I am sure the economics 101 students or the year 12 students who have just studied economics would say, 'Every extra $1 billion that the government spends is an extra $1 billion that the Reserve Bank Governor has to take out of the economy via higher mortgage rates.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They were able to simultaneously do two things: they broke faith with the Australian public that they could be trusted to manage the budget, first and foremost, and they also outlined in their budget that, sadly, we won't see the $275 reduction in power bills that was promised on no less than 97 occasions by members opposite. They don't want to talk about it now. They don't want to repeat those promises now. I challenge members opposite to put those shiny little tiles on their Facebook pages today—the ones they put on before the election that said they would deliver power bill reductions of $275. Why? Because we saw in the budget that power prices are set to increase by more than 50 per cent. The government hashed the economics of this nation so badly in the first five minutes of government. It is not something that they should be patting themselves on the back for. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the member for Bowman eloquently outlined, this motion also mentions the success of repealing the cashless debit card. In my 10 or so years in this place there have been few things that have perplexed me more than this policy from the Labor Party. I think we have to accept in politics that people are here for the right reasons. In my experience all members of parliament are basically decent. So how on earth could an otherwise intelligent, decent person think that pouring more alcohol, drugs, gambling and pornography into vulnerable communities will somehow not have a devastating impact on those communities? How could anyone think that that's not going to lead to more children being neglected and more domestic violence? </span>
              </p>

                  </a>  Show us the research? Apparently more drugs and more alcohol are good things for communities and don't lead to more destructive behaviour! You don't need to be Einstein to work out that more drugs and more alcohol in those vulnerable communities is going to hurt the people who can least handle it, and that will be the children, who will be neglected, and that will be the women in particular, who will suffer domestic violence. To see the government patting themselves on the back for this litany of failures and the moral failure of the CDC is quite galling.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms BYRNES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cunningham</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:14</span>):  The member for Deakin may not have realised that in May this year the Australian people voted for change. They voted for a government that would finally put people first and build a better future for our nation, much better than the one that those opposite left behind. When the previous government left office, the vital services and supports Australians built for vulnerable people were in an absolute mess. In my previous role as a staffer, I saw just how much our community was suffering due to the nine years of neglect from the previous government. Our Public Service had been gutted and contracted out. This has decimated the morale of public servants and had a devastating effect on delivering the services that all Australians will need at some point in their lives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since the election in May, people in my community have said that they felt absolute relief when the Albanese government was sworn in, relief that they now have a government that cares, a government that listens, a government that makes them feel safe. Most importantly, they have said that the adults are back in charge. This Labor government is working hard to make our communities and our country a better place. This is a government that cares about people, it cares about our planet and it cares about our economy and jobs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">From speaking with my colleagues in recent months I know all of our offices have been inundated with people who need things fixed—and urgently. Many of them have told us that they had completely given up seeking help under the previous government. Since the election, my staff and I have processed over 1,000 meeting requests and invitations and helped more than 2,000 members of our community to get the support, services and assistance that they require. We have been inundated with people trying to resolve urgent care requirements under the NDIS, to progress Centrelink applications and to resolve year-long delays in their visa inquiries.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When Labor was first elected, there were one million backlogged visa applications. That's one million people who were awaiting the knowledge that they could come or stay in this country, build a family here or visit their loved ones. That's one million people who the previous government was unable to help or who it was simply uninterested in helping.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then there were the passport delays. All of us in this place will know the impact that passport delays have had on our communities. We have all heard the stories of locals having their family visits postponed or cancelled, having holidays delayed and, of course, being tragically unable to leave the country in time to visit a loved one before they passed. My staff have worked tirelessly and productively with the offices of the minister for immigration and the Minister for Foreign Affairs, making representations on behalf of many local constituents who have family members desperately waiting to come and visit them, especially after such a long time apart due to COVID.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to congratulate the minister for immigration, who last week announced that the Albanese-Labor government has cleared almost one-quarter of the backlogged visa applications that we inherited, and he hopes to clear 40 per cent of them by the end of the year. There are still a lot, but at least we are working our way through them. I would also like to thank the minister's staff for their help in assisting so many of my constituents. I know they are very grateful when we get good results.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also like to take a moment to thank my staff and the ministerial staff in this building for their tireless work in helping our community in the six months since my election. You have all done an amazing job in this busy, busy Labor government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition, we have been busy legislating the mandate that was given to us by the Australian people. Since being elected just six months ago, we have passed historic legislation, putting the care back into aged care. We are working hard to repair the system after nine years of neglect by those opposite. We have also legislated our climate targets and brought Australia back onto the world stage to help deliver a cleaner and greener future to tackle climate change. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are delivering on our commitment to provide Australians with cheaper medicines and 10 days of paid family and domestic violence leave and to repeal the cruel cashless welfare card. I know many in my community are particularly excited for us to deliver on our A Future Made in Australia plan, ensuring regional Australia is at the forefront of manufacturing and helping to build our clean energy future. That's not all: we are currently debating legislation on secure jobs, better pay, cheaper child care, safer workplaces for women and a national anti-corruption commission. I am so proud of the first six months of this government, and I can't wait to see the better future we are building.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The No. 1 issue that I hear when travelling around the electorate of Flynn is that people are struggling with the cost of living. This is why I've introduced today's motion as a matter of urgency. I've been inundated by emails and calls from retirees, families and working people who are hurting every time they go to the supermarket, every time they open their electricity bill, every time they get a letter from their banks announcing interest rate rises and every time they fill up at the fuel bowser.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to share some stories that I've been told. A Gracemere based resident said that some weeks she doesn't have enough food to feed herself. She has had to sell her family heirloom jewellery and her only sofa just to pay her rates. This is unsustainable. A Gladstone based resident said that she was unable to go to the doctor due to the increased cost of living and the high cost of appointments, with no bulk-billing services available. A Mount Morgan retiree said that she has decreased her trips to Rockhampton to get groceries because of the price of fuel. A small-business owner said that just one of his current electricity bills shows an 11 per cent increase in tariff and a 36 per cent increase in metering charges. He said in an email to me:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">This current federal government had spruced election promises of lower electricity prices and that all these installed renewables provide cheaper supply; however, the real-world evidence does not support their claims. As you are in opposition it is your responsibility to hold the government to account at every opportunity. I would ask you pressure this new federal government and the state government on behalf of those small businesses and families who must financially pay for all of this as we are on an unsustainable track.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 97 occasions, the Prime Minister promised Australians that their bills would go down by $275. Well, where is that reduction? The biggest missed opportunity is that the Labor budget does little to address the root cause of inflation. To help Australians facing rising prices, we need to tackle the source, not just the symptoms, of cost-of-living pressures. The budget fails to use fiscal policy to make any headway to reduce pressures on inflation—the source of the pressure. Instead, the budget raises a white flag on inflation. At the same time, the budget has forecast rising pressures on Australians. Meanwhile, since the budget was released, we have seen annual inflation hit 7.3 per cent, the highest level in more than three decades.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Reserve Bank, ANZ and the Commonwealth Bank of Australia, among others, have now forecast end-of-year inflation to be higher than what was contained in the budget. Stephen Koukoulas, former economist to Julia Gillard, has said the budget puts no downward pressure on inflation, leaving the RBA with all the work and 'carrying the can' in getting this inflation rate lower. They will undoubtedly raise interest rates further to counter the unhelpful government fiscal policy and other legislation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Already, a family with a $750,000 mortgage is paying more than $1,200 extra every month on its repayments compared to May this year. The Prime Minister said Labor had a lasting plan for cheaper mortgages. With expectations from Goldman Sachs that the cash rate could rise five more times in the next six months, Australians are facing more and more increases on their mortgage repayments. Not only has the government broken their promise; they have absolutely no plan. This government is just making a bad situation worse.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, this motion acknowledges that Australian households, including in my electorate of Flynn, are worried about the increasing pressures from the cost-of-living crisis brought about by recent interest rate rises and continued inflation. This government needs to focus on the issues that matter to Australians and deliver a real, comprehensive plan to ease inflation and cost-of-living pressures.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HVP" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PERRETT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moreton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:24</span>):  I rise in response to the motion put forward by the member for Flynn. Counter to what he has suggested, the Albanese government well understands that Australian households are feeling the pressure with rising cost-of-living expenses. Some of the factors at play come from outside Australia, such as Russia's illegal and brutal invasion of Ukraine and the effects that flow around the world from that. However, some of the pressures are actually home grown.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll be upfront. As the member for Flynn was only elected to the House in May this year, he might not have realised that the Liberal and National parties were actually in government for the last decade. In fact, the coalition has been on the Treasury benches for 21 of the last 27 years, so this nation's economic settings have their grubby fingers all over them. Perhaps the honourable member didn't notice this. I do note that, in his previous paid gig as the member for Callide, he managed to attend a four-hour estimates hearing and not ask a single question. Maybe attention to detail is not the member for Flynn's forte.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If the member for Flynn did some broader research, he might learn that the whole Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government shemozzle had 20 failed energy policies. That represents a wasted decade when it comes to a major cost input into households in Flynn and Moreton and businesses in Flynn and Moreton. This decade of inaction saw the member for Hume, while minister, deliberately hiding electricity price increases from the Australian people until after the election, and no apology has flowed from that. Again, being upfront, the member for Flynn doesn't actually believe in climate change—I noted that in his first speech. Despite what the local farmers tell him, he chooses to stick his head in the bulldust. So the member for Flynn probably celebrated each and every one of those 20 failed coalition energy plans.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The challenges Australia faces today weren't created by the Albanese government, but we do take responsibility for addressing them. Our economic plan is a direct and deliberate response to the challenges facing the economy, including cost-of-living pressures. Treasurer Chalmers delivered a budget focused on responsible cost-of-living measures that won't put extra pressure on rising inflation. Labor successfully argued for a FWC minimum wage increase in line with inflation, which will help some of the country's lowest paid workers pay their bills. We've extended paid pandemic leave, which was due to expire under the Liberals. This helps people still being impacted by COVID all over Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've introduced legislation that will drive investment in cleaner and cheaper energy, putting downward pressure on power prices. Sadly, the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government wasted a decade with inaction on renewables and on the cutting of emissions. And remember, Member for Flynn and everyone else in Australia: renewable energy is the cheapest form of energy. That inaction and flubbing from the coalition was cheered on by climate change deniers like the member for Flynn.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're also making sure that enough gas stays in Australia for Australian households and businesses, while having an export industry out of Gladstone. With international gas prices soaring, we needed to ensure that sufficient gas stayed in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've introduced legislation for cheaper child care—I see the minister present—that will help 1.26 million Australian families. Our cheaper childcare plan will boost productivity by allowing parents, mainly women, who want to work more hours or re-enter the workforce to do so. This also removes a major barrier for women and will greatly assist in meeting some of the skills and knowledge shortfalls being faced by every industry in Australia, as you will see if you go and walk down the main street of Biloela or any of the properties in Flynn.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Treasurer Chalmers' budget also cut the cost of medicines, not just for the city but for the bush. For the first time in its 75-year history, the maximum cost of general scripts under the PBS will fall. We've also listed and expanded important access to cancer medicines on the PBS.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're fast-tracking fee-free TAFE places. Like cheaper child care, this will assist industry in finding, retaining and upskilling workers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Pensions, allowances and rent assistance have increased in line with inflation. We're also bringing in a new pensioner work bonus so that older Australians can keep more of what they earn without it affecting their pension.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And the member for Flynn thinks we aren't doing anything to help cost of living? Maybe he has checked out, just like he did during that Queensland estimates session.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Lastly, and importantly for workers, Labor is getting wages moving again. Pay packets are just starting to pick up again. They're forecast to grow at the fastest pace in a decade, following a decade of wage stagnation. That was thanks to the deliberate design settings of the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison government. Imagine having a government that was designed to keep wages low!</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="201906" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr YOUNG</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Longman</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:29</span>):  I rise today in support of the member for Flynn's private members motion on the cost of living. In my electorate of Longman, everyday Australians are suffering terrible cost-of-living pressures. Inflation is tipped to hit eight per cent, a 30-year high. This is in stark contrast from when the coalition were last in government. Under the coalition we enjoyed some of the lowest interest rates, highest household savings and lowest credit card debt in recent history. The now Prime Minister promised before the election, 'Australians will be better off under a Labor government I lead.' If higher interest rates, electricity and gas prices and fuel prices are all signs of Australians being better off, then the Prime Minister has kept the promise. This is not how we measure being better off, and in fact Australian families will be $2,000 worse off by Christmas. Merry Christmas, Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is with some bemusement and dismay that I see Labor are talking about abolishing the stage 3 tax cuts brought in by the coalition when in government. This tremendous policy achieves what we all desire—that is, ensuring workers' real wages increase by allowing them to keep more of what they earn. But this policy also ensures no additional financial burden is placed on businesses, many of whom are now doing it tough. As I've stated many times, we'd all love workers to earn as much as possible. But consideration must be given to the whole picture, and the fact is whenever wages rise, these wage increases are passed on to consumers, the very people that received the wage rise. So I put the question to you: if a worker's gross pay goes up by $40 a week—of which they lose, say, $10 in tax—but due to other workers getting the same increases, which are passed on, their weekly expenses go up by $50, is this a good thing? I would suggest not. That is why tax cuts are the best form of wage increase, because they give workers more of their net, take-home pay without increasing the price of goods, so they are simply better off.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Why would Labor even consider removing these tax cuts? Their lefty mates in Greens say this is tax relief for the rich or the high earners. That's not good enough. Let's look at the rich getting out a take-home pay increase in this measure, shall we? A hairdresser earning $60,000 a year will take home an extra $400 a year, a teacher earning $70,000 a year will take home an extra more than $620 every year, an executive assistant earning $80,000 a year will take home around an extra $900 every year and a diesel mechanic earning $100,000 a year will take an extra more than $1,370 per year. These are not the rich; these are the everyday Australians the coalition has always fought for and will continue to fight for. We will never bow to the Greens and their agenda, unlike the Labor Party.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, not content to get rid of tax cuts for the average Aussie, to add extra pressure on Australians we have the energy affordability crisis. This is a twofold hit, as businesses like RGS in my electorate of Longman, who manufacture and distribute garden equipment like mowers and chainsaws and their associated parts, have been slugged with an additional $43,000 per annum electricity charge. This means that prices for these items at the check-out will increase to cover these higher costs, adding even more cost-of-living pressures. This is a straight-out election promise broken, as the Prime Minister promised 97 times before the election that his government would cut prices by $275—no exceptions, no statements of 'depending on this or that'; just an unconditional promise. Instead, their own budget stated that electricity prices would rise by 56 per cent over the next two years and gas 44 per cent—so much for a cut.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mortgage pressures hurt both property owners and renters in our communities. Interest rates have skyrocketed since Labor achieved government, and a family with a mortgage of $500,000 is already paying $800 per month over what they were under the coalition. Again, this Prime Minister said that his government had a plan for cheaper mortgages. There were no conditions, no exceptions—just a promise which, again, has been broken. To try and alleviate the financial mess of this budget, Labor have reverted to their default position of increasing taxes, with $142 billion of extra taxes announced in the recent budget and, I'm sure, more to come. This of course will also add more cost-of-living pressures for everyday Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians want and deserve a government that will keep its word and not continuously blame previous governments and outside factors. A strong leader takes responsibility for the cards they are dealt and gets on with the job. This government does none of this. Yes, they are truly living up to the Labor mantra: when Labor can't manage money, they come after yours. Prepare to buckle down, Australia. The worst from this lot is yet to come.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">NCE</span> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hasluck</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:34</span>):  The member for Flynn, like myself, is a member of the class of 2022 in this 47th Parliament. However, unlike me, the member has arrived in this place with some years of political experience, having previously served in the Queensland parliament from 2017. This begs a question that perhaps is a sign of my own naivety: why do those opposite insist on giving this government opportunity after opportunity to speak on the responsible work of our Treasurer and finance minister and illustrate what a mess we've inherited? For what reason the member for Flynn has decided to carry this candle, for his side, remains a mystery to me. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Only a few days ago, I had the honour of reminding members in the Federation Chamber of the virtues of the Albanese government's responsible economic management, thanks to a motion from the member for Menzies. Now the member for Flynn has obliged me. This government has been upfront and honest about the fiscal and monetary challenges we've inherited, and we are taking decisive and targeted action. Treasurer Chalmers' budget, delivered in October, begins the task of dealing with inflation, the deliberate low-wages policy of the former government and debt caused by years of lazy and wrongheaded government. I believe that if the member for Cook were still Prime Minister—busily sharing portfolios with some of those opposite—the same cost-of-living pressures would be present but there would not be the same will or capacity to act. This government is acting. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are investing in cheaper early childhood education, giving a million families more options; making PBS medicines cheaper, to ease costs and keep people healthier; and getting wages moving again, empowering workers to earn more. As a stark point of difference, this government has prioritised paying down the trillion dollars of Liberal debt. Addressing the cost of living must involve keeping a lid on inflation. Despite the incessant shrieking and scaremongering from those opposite, Treasury modelling has confirmed that the Chalmers budget is the responsible way to move forward without exacerbating inflationary pressures. Those pressures are mostly coming from the global environment, as members well know. Government policy must be directed towards softening the blow, flattening the curve and preparing for recovery in the medium and longer term. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Addressing the cost of living means taking a hard look at energy policy and doing the right thing. The coalition is no stranger to developing energy policies. They tried to do quite a few but never landed a single one. The true path to long-term sustainable, lower energy prices is the rapid transformation to a green energy economy based on renewables, a dependable grid and forms of storage including batteries. Just today I read about the Norwegian company Equinor investing in offshore wind generation in Australia. Is there anyone in this chamber who seriously believes that we would be attracting the levels of investment and interest that we now see if the Minister for Climate Change and Energy wasn't active in this space, if he hadn't designated offshore zones and introduced legislation to support them, if we hadn't passed the climate change bills? I note that when the member for Flynn had a chance to support the climate change bills, a couple of months ago, he squibbed and voted against them. The member for Flynn is reported as having said that renewal energy is fantasy. He should take action against the newspapers if this is not true, as it seriously makes him look foolish. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another important way to combat the cost of living is to ensure that wages haven't flatlined, especially where they haven't kept pace with either inflation or productivity. We have had nine years of coalition governments where low wages were a deliberate design feature of their policies. Now the Albanese government has supported wage rises for low-paid workers and has brought legislation into parliament to get wages moving again. I note that the member for Flynn voted against that legislation last week too. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Flynn did rather well, though, out of the first Chalmers budget handed down a month ago. The commitments made for Flynn by candidate Burnett and the Labor team are all there, funded in the budget. I count 21 across the electorate, from Gladstone to the Highlands, including a long-awaited pool at Boyne/Tannum and upgrades to the Bruce Highway. I'm the member for Hasluck, so I shouldn't have to stand here and tell the people of Flynn how good the Albanese government is to them, but I know that the member for Flynn isn't going to do it. He's just going to sit there polishing leather with his climate denier's hat on and, when confronted with a list of commitments as long as your arm and all funded in the budget, will say—and I quote from the <span style="font-style:italic;">Courier Mail</span> on 27 October:</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mayo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:39</span>):  It's hard not to feel a sense of dread and despair with the direction of the Australian economy. The discussion du jour across every household is the worrying increase in the cost of living, and it's easy to see why. Inflation rose by 1.8 per cent in the September quarter to reach 7.3 per cent for the past year. This is the highest increase since 1990. I remember 1990 very well, and it is my deep fear that we are heading back there, where we will have double-digit interest rates.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The cost of non-discretionary items rose at an annual pace of 8.4 per cent in the September quarter, up from 7.6 per cent in the June quarter, which the Australian Bureau of Statistics dubs as a new high. These are essential items that consumers typically cannot avoid buying, such as fuel and food staples. The cost of discretionary items rose by 5.5 per cent. I just read that Stephen Koukoulas has said that retail spending is very, very low.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The impact is real. I've personally seen anecdotal evidence in my local supermarkets in Mayo. One really easy way to see that people are really struggling is that they're trying to buy exclusively home brand. If you look around at home brand in your stores, that section of the shelf is empty at the moment. Foodbank Australia, another community food distribution organisation, are servicing more people, many of whom have never reached out to these services before. Foodbank Australia CEO Brianna Casey commented on the <span style="font-style:italic;">Foodbank </span><span style="font-style:italic;">H</span><span style="font-style:italic;">unger </span><span style="font-style:italic;">R</span><span style="font-style:italic;">eport</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> 2022</span>. She said:</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I have witnessed firsthand the rise in demand for food relief services over the past year as the country has been 'recovering' from Covid-19, but even I'm shocked by the picture that is exposed in this report.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Adding to the pain, Treasury estimates that wages will not outstrip inflation until 2024 at the earliest. However, by then, Australians will have experienced a 20 per cent rise in electricity bills this year and a further 30 per cent rise in the next financial year. That is a 50 per cent increase. Similarly, gas bills are also expected to rise by 20 per cent this year and a further 20 in the next financial year—40 per cent in total.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ahead of the election, the Labor Party did spruik its credentials on its ability to lower power prices—and I'm assuming that that's from the time of the election and not where we're going to in a couple of years—by $275 per annum. I've been listening to the debate, and everyone is blaming each other, which is the usual thing that happens in this place, with nobody really coming up with any solutions. I ask the government to be truthful. When will Australians see that $275 or the equivalent on their power bills? And, if it can't deliver, I think it's time that the government was honest with the Australian people. In my electorate, I have constituents saying to me, 'Rebekha, when is my power bill going to get cheaper?' And I say, 'I just don't know.' I think I'm correct in hearing that the member for Moreton said that that $275 would be delivered by 2025. That's too far away. That's effectively another election away.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For many Australians, there really is no light to the end of the tunnel. It's quite the opposite. Under the poor guidance of the Reserve Bank of Australia, which touted for months that record-low interest rates would remain low until 2024, we've seen lots of people get mortgages right up to their borrowing capacity on sub-two-per-cent interest rates. That's going to be converted to a variable rate for many very soon of between five and seven per cent. The extent of this impending calamity is enormous. Forty-six per cent of home loans written in July and August last year were on a fixed rate. A total of $158 billion of fixed-rate mortgages will mature before the end of this financial year. It's going to mean a very bleak Christmas for a lot of people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Inflation, cost-of-living increases, out-of-control energy prices and mortgage increases are seriously hurting Australians. I support this motion that calls on the government to focus on the issues that really matter and to deliver a real and comprehensive plan to address these issues. I listened to a speech by the member for Sturt in the Federation Chamber last week. He said that what we don't want to see are high wages creating this effect of spiralling inflation further and further into double digits. Let's focus on families. Let's focus on our communities. Let's focus on getting inflation down. We don't want to go back to 1990; it was a horrible time. It was the recession that we supposedly needed to have, but, let me tell you, it was a horrible time to be a young person in Australia. We can do better.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr RAE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hawke</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:45</span>):  Despite what they say, the former Liberal government's pathetic record on economic management is absolutely clear. A trillion dollars of debt—that is your economic legacy. No matter how much they try to peddle the mistruth that they are superior economic managers, they cannot escape the simple fact that they left office with a trillion dollars of debt and nothing more than a negligible economic dividend to show for it. Instead, Australians lived through the worst decade for productivity in half a century and a decade of negative real wage growth.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have spoken on several motions like this one during my brief time in this place: cut and paste Liberal spin that ignores the fact they were in government for almost a decade. The member for Flynn starts this one by rightly highlighting that many Australians are doing it tough, and the cost of living is rising fast. Interest rates and inflation are rising alongside, as they began to under the previous Liberal government, and household budgets are consequently stressed. As always, the member goes on to ignore the countless cost-of-living relief measures the Albanese Labor government is implementing. However, where this motion departs from all those that I've had the pleasure of speaking on previously is where it fails to mention the Liberals' decade of deliberate negative wage growth that has left so many Australians ill-equipped to handle the cost-of-living challenge.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2019, the former federal Liberal Finance Minister, Mathias Cormann, said that low wage growth was, 'A deliberate design feature of our economic architecture.' Australians should reflect on this. The Liberals deliberately kept your wages low while the profits of their corporate mates were soaring. Just earlier this year, the former Prime Minister and member for Cook described the prospect of a $1-an-hour increase to the minimum wage as 'reckless and dangerous'. This deliberate effort to stifle wages, while increasing the profits of their corporate mates, has left Australian families doing it very tough, and I'm not surprised that those opposite don't want to talk about it anymore.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians know that it was the former Liberal government that created the economic challenges we face today. However, Australians also know that only an Albanese Labor government can deliver the actual reform that will address those structural challenges. That's why they elected us and that's what we'll do. That's why our government has ended the previous government's policy of keeping wages low as a deliberate design feature of the economy they were running, and we are focused on getting wages moving again. Before the year is out, the Albanese Labor government will pass the Fair Work Legislation Amendment (Secure Jobs, Better Pay) Bill 2022 to restore the balance at the bargaining table and deliver wage rises for Australian workers and their families. Sadly, this will pass without the support of those opposite. They don't want to talk about wage growth, and they certainly don't want to see it either. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Wage growth is just one part of Labor's plan to address the cost-of-living challenges faced by so many Australian families. Last month, in the first of many budget speeches, the Treasurer detailed Labor's economic plan to deliver a direct and deliberate response to the challenges facing our economy, including the cost of living. The Albanese Labor government is delivering cheaper child care to Australian families, including 7,000 families in my electorate of Hawke. These 7,000 households will be getting cheaper child care with the maximum childcare subsidy to rise to 90 per cent. Parents in Hawke will also have access to a full 26 weeks of paid parental leave as the Commonwealth scheme is expanded over the coming years. The cost of medicines will be slashed, as script costs plummet at the local pharmacy by $12.50 per script. And the rising cost of housing will be addressed through the new housing accord.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese Labor government is getting on with the job of fixing up the Liberal Party's mess, driving down the trillion dollars of debt they created and getting wages moving again. Alongside that, we will continue to provide much-needed relief to household budgets through our additional policy measures.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dawson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:50</span>):  The No. 1 issue for all Australians right now is the ever-increasing cost-of-living pressures, and, unfortunately, they're increasing at a rapid rate. Everyone is affected and no-one is immune—the young couple who have just purchased their first home, the mum and dad who are working long hours to feed their three kids or the pensioner who is too scared to turn on the air conditioning. I want to thank the member for Flynn, Mr Colin Boyce, for raising this critical issue as a matter of priority. Well done.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor government promised a lot during the election, but these promises seem to have disappeared into the wild blue yonder. Labor promised a plan to bring down the cost of living. Labor promised cheap electricity—they actually promised this 97 times. Labor promised a cheaper mortgage. Labor promised no changes to franking credits. But, six months on, all that Australians have from their government is a growing list of broken promises, causing fear and uncertainty in our communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On budget night, this Labor government walked away from a commitment to reduce every household's energy bill by $275—a promise repeated over 97 times. Instead, what this government has given us is a 56 per cent increase in power prices. It's getting harder and harder for families to make ends meet and to enjoy the simple things in life—and those things are fast becoming luxuries. Garnier shampoo is now being replaced with Homebrand. A piece of rump steak is now too expensive, and mincemeat is purchased instead. Tinned fruit and frozen veggies are replacing fresh produce.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition had a plan to target this very issue, using the agricultural visa. Labour shortages across our ag sector are creating significant strain on farmers and pushing up the cost of fruit and veggies. The National Farmers Federation have estimated that we need an additional 172,000 workers for the sector. Since the Labor government has scrapped the ag visa—except for Vietnam, and that's only thanks to pressure from the coalition—Labor has a plan for only 42,000 workers, and that leaves our farmers short 75 per cent of what's required. Farmers have not got the certainty to plan and are having their produce fall to the ground. When there is no-one to harvest the produce, it goes nowhere, and the profit is zero. The inaction of the Albanese government is costing Australians at the check-out.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate of Dawson, kids are missing out on playing sport because they have to travel to neighbouring towns to compete. This is purely due to the cost of fuel. This is another choice that's been forced on families: sports, or food on the table. A pensioner who can't afford the expense of running their air conditioner will be forced to suffer in the stifling heat and humidity that my region experiences every summer. Constituents who need to travel for regular medical appointments with specialists—from smaller towns like Bowen to main centres like Townsville, a 400 kilometre round trip—are struggling with the extra fuel costs. Do they make those trips, or do they neglect their health? People want to know when this government is going to get their act together and address the cost-of-living crisis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My people in Dawson deserve a government that does more than just congratulate themselves at every opportunity. They're crying out for real solutions that will ease the growing cost pressures, bring electricity prices down and keep food on the table. Prime Minister, our country needs you to take responsibility. You're not in opposition; you're at the helm.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since the budget was announced, we've seen inflation hit 7.3 per cent—the highest level in more than three decades. Homeowners with mortgages are feeling overwhelmed by their extraordinary payments.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Already, a family with a $750,000 mortgage is paying $1,200 more each month compared to what they were prior to the election. I am urging the Labor government to get the priorities of this nation right. We are staring down the barrel of a very bleak and very dark future. For the sake of the good people of Dawson and all Australians, it's time to put the cost-of-living crisis as priority number 1. And, for the record, Australia is not in $1 trillion of debt. That is just another Labor lie. Those figures are available to everybody—have a look.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Sturt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:55</span>):  I rise to speak on the cost-of-living motion. I'll start by saying there is no doubt that times are really tough out there. Households, businesses—small businesses in particular—and households on fixed incomes are really struggling. That is something that the government can bury their head in the sand over if they choose to, but the reality is those of us that are genuinely listening to our communities and hearing about those challenges and struggles on a daily basis are very despondent that we have a government that is doing nothing about this crisis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As other speakers have pointed out—and I commend the member for Mayo's contribution regarding electricity, because this is really important—it is time for the government to be honest with people about a promise they made during the May election to reduce electricity prices and what the reality of that situation is going to be. I think the government attempt to put a lot of smoke and mirrors around this solemn promise that they made, but the timeline is really important and it is really straightforward. The then Labor opposition announced their climate change energy policy in December 2021. Within that were certain measures. This poor company called RepuTex, which will probably never recover from their association with this Labor policy costing exercise, costed that policy and said clearly in the document that if the Labor Party were elected and implemented all of their electricity policies that by 2025, as against December 2021, electricity prices would fall for the average residential consumer by 18 per cent, or $275. That's by 2025. Labor have confirmed in their recent budget that in the financial year ending 2023 and the financial year ending 2024, electricity prices are going to go up cumulatively by 56 per cent. To achieve that 18 per cent, there needs to be 74 per cent off come June 2024. It will be a spectacular effort if they can keep that promise to achieve a 74 per cent reduction between June 2024 and June 2025, but I highly doubt that is going to occur.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's time to come clean and be honest to people that you made a promise to them and you're not going to keep it. Yes, of course, issues have come to bear since then, like the war in Ukraine. That was in February, and subsequent to February, the then Labor opposition continued to make this spurious promise that they would reduce electricity prices by 18 per cent or $275 to the average residential consumer by 2025. They have then handed down a budget and said that by the 30 June 2024 prices will go up by 56 per cent—a 74 per cent deficit to make up in 12 months. This is simply not going to happen, and the households and businesses of this country deserve to be told the truth by the government, which is that they told you they were going to cut your bills by 18 per cent and that's no longer going to happen.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are some people out there that still have faith in commitments that are made in election campaigns and believe that there's no reason a government, if they said they were going to do something, would not deliver on it. As the member for Mayo points out, there are people struggling with their electricity bills that may still be thinking there is a dramatic reduction in their bill on the way because the Labor Party said in opposition said 'If we are in government we will cut your bills by 18 per cent, or $275.' Clearly people are still hoping that that's going to happen. If it's not, they deserve some honesty from this government. The government should come clean and say: 'What we said we would do is not going to happen. We told you we'd cut your electricity bills, but that's not the case.' </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Far from it, prices are increasing dramatically. It could be that the 56 per cent by 2024 is only going to increase more and more in the future. When we get to 2025, when we thought we'd have had an extra $275 in our pocket through a reduction in our electricity bill, it's going to be dramatically different. People make serious decisions about their budgets based on these things. It is high time we had some honesty. The government should come clean and admit that that commitment is never going to happen. It should be honest with the people of this country.</span>

It is worthy of the House noting the significance of this legislative change, which we're supporting with the amendments made by the Senate. With this respect at work bill we have now taken another important step towards what should be at the heart of any society that has the right to call itself civilised—the right to a safe and respectful workplace. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government I'm so very proud to lead has delivered on another promise it made to the Australian people. Labor campaigned on a promise to implement every single one of the recommendations of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Respect@Work</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span>report into sexual harassment in Australian workplaces. Shortly after I was sworn in as Prime Minister I made it clear that this election promise was now a key part of the agenda of the new government.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The last two years have been a real reckoning in this country. Australian women have stood up—not the least of which were outside this very building—and courageously and emphatically declared: 'Enough is enough.' We are a great country, but there is an even greater Australia within our reach if only we dare to extend ourselves a little.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're working to address the imbalances in our society that have, for so long, been tilted against women, and I'm proud of what we've achieved in our first six months—cheaper child care and early childhood education, a plan to expand paid parental leave, women's economic equality put at the centre of the Jobs and Skills Summit, gender equity to be written into the Fair Work Act and record investment in women's safety. I'm very proud to lead a Labor caucus 103 strong of which 54 are women. The fact that we had that advance at the last election gave a mandate for us moving forward on these issues. These acts are all acts of equality, but so much of it is also about economic reform.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is just in our first six months. I declare today that we've begun as we mean to continue. The speed with which we've acted is the only correct response to the calculated inertia of the previous decade. Those opposite sat on the Jenkins report for almost a year without even responding to it, and then they refused to implement key recommendations. In 2021, they even voted against Labor's amendments to introduce a positive duty on employers to stop sexual harassment in their workplaces. Imagine holding that up to the nation is one of your principles and being proud of that?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The circumstances we've inherited are not good enough. During the last decade Australia fell to 70th in the world for women's economic participation and opportunity, and we went from being the 24th most equal country in the world for women and men to the 50th. That is so far from good enough that it is hard to measure. We will allow no more of these opportunities to be lost.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will place a positive duty on employers to take reasonable and proportionate measures to eliminate sex discrimination, sexual harassment and victimisation as far as possible. It will especially prohibit conduct that results in a hostile work environment on the basis of gender and it will ensure Commonwealth public sector organisations are also required to report to the Workplace Gender Equality Agency on their gender equality indicators.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to once again express our great debt of gratitude to everyone who stepped up to share their experiences with Sex Discrimination Commissioner Kate Jenkins. Their courage gave us a template for a better future, and we're following that template.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is a key part of our mission to progress gender equality across all of our workers of government. With this bill, we recognise that achieving women's economic equality includes making sure women are safe at work, and we'll keep working with governments and businesses to make sure all Respect@Work recommendations are put in place. We must never accept sexual harassment as either inevitable or unavoidable, because it is anything but. Nor should we exempt the dangerous, low-energy fiction that somehow we are incapable of improvement. Think about how far we have come as a society and as a nation. Think of all we have managed to achieve together as a people. Australia is a country that gets things done, especially when the Australian people have a government that measures up to their energy, to their ambition, to their courage and, most importantly, to their abiding sense of fairness.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is what we're doing here: we're writing a new chapter and moving forward with our national story. We're building a better future, one with equality and respect at its core. And we're allowing ourselves the possibility of an Australia that reflects our highest ideals. Most importantly, with this legislation we are doing what is right.</span>

                    <a href="109556" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr LEESER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Berowra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:09</span>):  The Crimes Amendment (Penalty Unit) Bill 2022 will increase the value of the Commonwealth penalty unit from $222 to $225, with effect from 1 January 2023. The bill also provides that indexation will occur every three years from 1 July 2023. Effectively, the government is imposing an additional increase on the value of the penalty unit from 1 January 2023, with triannual indexation resuming on 1 July 2023.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Penalty units determine the maximum fines which can be imposed for offences in Commonwealth legislation and territory ordinances. When the penalty unit was introduced in 1992 its value was set at $100. This was adjusted to $110 in 1997, $170 in 2012, $180 in 2015 and $210 in 2017. In 2015 the Crimes Act was amended to introduce an indexation mechanism to automatically increase the value of the penalty unit, every three years, in line with the consumer price index. An indexation occurred on 1 July 2020 when the penalty unit was increased to $222. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will increase the revenue return to the Consolidated Revenue Fund for pecuniary penalties imposed, for the commission of Commonwealth criminal offences, by $31.6 million over four years. It's not entirely lost on members of the coalition that the amount to which the Commonwealth penalty unit is being increased, $275, is the one amount that the Prime Minister doesn't want to talk about in this House—because that was the same amount he promised Australians their power bills would be reduced by. </span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr LEESER:</span>
                    </a>  As the Manager of Opposition Business reminds me, it's the number that dare not speak its name, except in the penalty unit bill, and we should be reminded that the Prime Minister's failure to keep his promise in reducing power prices effectively is a penalty on the Australian people. The coalition supports this bill. I want to take the opportunity talk a bit about some of the things that the coalition in government did, to fight crime and keep our communities safe, in the context of this bill. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the March 2022-23 budget the coalition government announced an investment of $170.4 million, in the Australian Federal Police and Australian Border Force capabilities, to harden our border against transnational, serious and organised crime. These measures include: the establishment of dedicated AFP strike teams to target the importation and manufacture of illicit drugs, firearms and money-laundering; boosting the Australian Federal Police's specialist capabilities to keep pace with the growing threat of outlaw motorcycle gangs, organised crime cartels and other crime groups; and strengthening investment in the Australian Federal Police's Criminal Assets Confiscation Taskforce to further disrupt criminal business and remove the profit out of crime. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Ensuring our community and borders are protected has always been a priority for the coalition. That's why in government the AFP's funding was increased to a record $1.7 billion. The coalition government strongly backed in Australia's law enforcement agencies when we held office, and I'm concerned how these national security agencies will fare under the government. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This contrasts with the last time Labor were in government. They raided the accounts of our law enforcement agencies to prop up their budget bottom line. Labor's safety record at our airports and seaports has been abysmal. Labor were dragged kicking and screaming to finally support our legislation for tougher security requirements for those who worked in those protected areas at ports and airports. The Prime Minister's union bosses opposed security checks for ports and airport staff. Labor opposed it for years, before finally agreeing in 2021. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In one of the last sitting weeks before the election we saw a major Labor backflip, in relation to firearms trafficking. Organised crime syndicates, outlaw motorcycle gangs and other criminals who traffic firearms face tougher penalties under national gun laws secured by the Morrison government—after a backdown from the Labor Party, after five years in which they objected to them. The Criminal Code Amendment (Firearms Trafficking) Act 2022 increased the maximum penalty for firearms trafficking from 10 to 20 years imprisonment, and under a second aggravated offence for the most serious of traffickers offenders face up to life imprisonment. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For five years, Labor claimed they couldn't support this law because of their opposition to mandatory minimum sentencing, before suddenly abandoning that long-held policy. Transnational, serious and organised crime threatens the safety, security and trust of all Australians and their way of life. It affects all Australians. We in the coalition will continue to take every possible action to combat this threat to our way of life and to bring criminals to justice. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In government, the coalition provided our law enforcement, intelligence and border agencies the power and resources they needed to take the profit out of crime and harden Australia's supply chains against criminals. From the latest analysis by the Australian Criminal Intelligence Commission, transnational, serious and organised crime costs the Australian economy up to $60.1 billion a year. This has devastating impacts on families and communities, causing lost income, health and social impacts as well as the erosion of public trust in our government, business and public institutions. The Australian Federal Police led Operation Ironside, which publicly exposed the insidious and pervasive impact that transnational, serious and organised crime has on the safety and security of Australia. While Operation Ironside was a success, there's much more work to do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to talk a little bit about outlaw motorcycle gangs and the coalition's approach to organised crime. This approach was multifaceted. We locked up criminals, but we also kicked out foreign criminals and thugs who abused our nation's hospitality. When the coalition was in government, we cancelled or refused the visas of 335 outlaw motorcycle gang members and removed 233 of them from Australia for breaking our laws. In total, from 2014, we cancelled or refused over 10,000 visas on character grounds, keeping Australians safe from the triads, the mafia and the bikies who seek to ply their deadly trade in our community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In government, the coalition didn't tolerate noncitizens who engage in criminal activity or behaviour of concern, including involvement with outlaw motorcycle gangs and organised crime, and we will continue to act decisively to protect the community from the risk of harm posed by these individuals. Australian Border Force worked closely with the Department of Home Affairs and law enforcement agencies to identify and, where appropriate, cancel or refuse the visas of noncitizens engaged in organised criminal activities or associated with criminal gangs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All noncitizens who wish to enter or remain in Australia must satisfy the requirements of the Migration Act and Migration Regulations, including the section 501 character test. A noncitizen may not pass the character test on a number of grounds, including, but not limited to, if they have a substantial criminal record or they're suspected of associating with, or being a member of, a group involved in criminal conduct. A noncitizen's visa must be cancelled if they're serving a full-time term of imprisonment for an offence committed in Australia and they have at any time been sentenced to a period of 12 months or more in prison. If a visa is cancelled in these circumstances, the person may apply to the minister for revocation of the visa cancellation decision. The minister has personal powers enabling them to cancel or refuse a visa without notice where it's considered in the national interest to do so. Noncitizens who do not hold a valid visa will be liable for detention and removal from Australia, pending resolution of any ongoing matters.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All removals are carried out in a way that ensures the safety and security of those individuals being removed, the staff and the public. Removals from Australia are undertaken as soon as reasonably practical, through both voluntary and involuntary pathways. Between December 2014 and 28 February 2022, as I said, 335 outlaw motorcycle gang members, associates or organised crime figures had their visas cancelled or refused under the character and general cancellation powers. From 11 December 2014 to 28 February 2022, 233 outlaw motorcycle gang members, associates or organised crime figures were removed from Australia by the coalition.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to talk a little bit about the cost of crime. The Australian Institute of Criminology, in their report <span style="font-style:italic;">E</span><span style="font-style:italic;">stimating the cost</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> of serious </span><span style="font-style:italic;">and </span><span style="font-style:italic;">organised crime in Australia </span><span style="font-style:italic;">20</span><span style="font-style:italic;">20</span><span style="font-style:italic;">-</span><span style="font-style:italic;">21</span>, found a number of key matters that are essential to understanding why it's important to take a strong approach to crime. Firstly, the report considered the direct and consequential cost of serious and organised crime in Australia as well as the cost to government entities, businesses and individuals associated with perverting and responding to serious and organised crime. Depending on the extent to which serious and organised crime is involved in various types of crime, the estimated costs from range from $24.8 billion to $60.1 billion. These are really extraordinary figures when you think about it. Prevention and response costs were estimated to be up to $16.4 billion in 2020-21 alone. These included costs incurred by law enforcement, the criminal justice system, other government agencies, the private sector and individuals in the community in preventing and responding to crime. Continuing to measure these costs will help us understand the impact organised crime has on the community, and it will be an important tool in Australia's response to serious and organised crime in the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Costing a black market can be difficult and necessarily requires sensitive data and information. This latest analysis has been derived from research and classified intelligence holdings. Serious and organised crime operates in a black market with the goal of avoiding law enforcement detection. As such, calculating its cost is inherently difficult and dependent on available data and suitable costing methodologies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Institute of Criminology recognises that crime data will never be completely reflective of the true extent of crime and will always be subject to limitations in data availability and analysis. The aim of the project was to provide an analytical framework which presents a systematic and structured picture of different costs of serious and organised crime. I think I've demonstrated that the cost of crime to the community is very, very serious and that the coalition takes the prevention of crime and the safety of our community very seriously as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is one final matter I'd like to deal with, and that is the nature of support that the coalition has provided, when in government, for victims of crime, and I think that's a particularly important thing. Anyone who's a victim of crime has suffered unfairly and unnecessarily, and it's the job of good government to try and support victims, who, through no fault of their own, have been a victim of crime. The coalition is committed to supporting victims-survivors and making sure that those who commit sexual assault face justice. That's why in government we funded a $1.3 billion women's safety package in the 2022-23 budget as part of a total investment to support the delivery of the next National Plan to End Violence against Women and Children from 2022 to 2032, with a historic $2½ billion over the first five years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As part of that package, the coalition announced an investment of $4.1 million to develop and deliver a dedicated training program for law enforcement across Australia to ensure we can effectively identify and support victims-survivors of all forms of family, domestic and sexual violence. The Department of Home Affairs will deliver a scoping study to inform the design and implementation of alternative reporting mechanisms so that victims-survivors who may be apprehensive about approaching the police can report an assault in some other way.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an important bill. It increases the value of the penalty unit from $222 to $275, but it's also an important opportunity and reminder to take stock of the importance of preventing crime and of supporting the victims of crime in the sterling way that the coalition did it in government.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="291387" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HAMILTON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Groom</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:22</span>):  I appreciate the chance to talk on this very, very important bill. Today, I rise in support of the Crimes Amendment (Penalty Unit) Bill 2022, which legislates for an increase in value of the Commonwealth penalty unit to from $222 to $275 from 1 January this year. Like the previous speaker, I note that the number 275 must be the most noted number in this term of government so far.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an additional increase beyond the usual triennial indexation of the Commonwealth penalty unit, with the usual schedule of automatic indexation resuming on 1 July 2023. This change will increase the revenue return to the Commonwealth by $31.6 million over the next four years. These penalty units that we are discussing determine the maximum fines which can be imposed for offences in Commonwealth legislation and territory ordinances. While the application of these penalty units will rightfully remain in the hands of sentencing judges, the change will ensure that financial penalties, when used, align with community expectations and provide a meaningful deterrent to those engaging in unlawful behaviour.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To pick up on a few comments from the shadow Attorney-General, the intent of the coalition's approach when in government was to take the profit out of crime and to find ways to address the motivating forces that drive crime in our community. I think that's why I very much support any measure whatsoever that increases that punishment. As the Leader of the Opposition has said, wherever there is legislation that supports the Australian people we will support that legislation. The shadow Attorney-General spoke about the work of outlaw motorcycle gangs in my region. What this has led to is the ice problems that we've faced, particularly in small country towns, where we've seen an explosion in the amount of that drug being used and sold. It's had devastating impacts on those communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it's also quite important to focus on the fact that when the coalition were in government we not only focused on addressing crime but also made it a key priority to focus on the victims of crime, especially, as has been raised, the $1.3 million for the women's safety package. Again to speak to my area of Groom, one of the issues we have seen is a rise in domestic violence cases, particularly amongst women in the 55-plus age group. Sadly, we see so many people in this age group coming to Toowoomba to try to find housing, work and support, so this is a key area for us to continue focusing on. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the electorate of Groom residents are currently being plagued by break-ins and car theft from a revolving door of youth offenders, and nothing erodes community trust faster than the perception that the punishments being handed out by the courts do not fit the crime. To all the people I have spoken to on this issue across the electorate of Groom, be it doorknocking or at mobile officers, I say that I will continue to make this a priority of my time in this place. I will support any legislation that is tough on crime. When you have the erosion of community trust, it leaves people feeling scared, unsafe and alone, which is utterly unacceptable. But, as is the case here, we can't blame the courts when they're dealing with inadequate laws that provide inadequate penalties. It's up to us as lawmakers to ensure that they have the tools they need and that our legislation is regularly fine-tuned and updated to keep pace with community expectations. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is something that we on the side of the House and the previous coalition government pay particular attention to, amending and introducing new offences to keep Australians safe. We took an unapologetically tough-on-crime approach, and our achievements must be upheld by this new Labor government. That starts by properly funding our law enforcement agencies so that people are pursued and prosecuted for illegal activities. In the 2022-23 budget the coalition government announced an investment of $170.4 million in AFP and Australian Border Force capabilities to harden Australia's border against transnational serious and organised crime, including the establishment of dedicated AFP strike teams to target the importation and manufacture of illicit drugs, firearms and money-laundering. The investment also included boosting the AFP's specialist capabilities to keep pace with the growing threat of outlaw motorcycle gangs, organised crime cartels and other crime groups and strengthening investment in the AFP's Criminal Asset Confiscation Taskforce to further disrupt criminal businesses and remove the profit out of crime. Under the coalition the AFP's funding increased to a record $1.7 billion, and I think we can be quite proud that, wherever the opportunity arose for us to support strengthening law enforcement during our time in government, we were there supporting our people on the front line to do that. That is an achievement of the last coalition government that we can be very, very proud of. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In contrast—and these are important points about the last time the Labor were in government—they raided the accounts of our law enforcement agencies for the sake of propping up the budget bottom line. With the recent Optus and Medibank hacks so fresh in the minds of many Australians, including many people in my community who've been affected by these incidents, we cannot afford to take a backward step on the funding of our key security agencies who are investigating who is responsible and how we can hold them to account. As we enter another challenging economic period, can we really trust that we will not see a similar approach from this government? The approach the previous coalition government took worked, and we need to see that continue. But beyond the budget the coalition's approach to organised crime was multifaceted. We locked criminals up but we also kicked out the foreign criminals and thugs who abused our nation's hospitality. When the coalition was in government we cancelled or refused the visas of 335 outlaw motorcycle gang members and removed 233 from Australia for breaking our laws, including 52 from my state of Queensland. In total we've cancelled or refused over 10,000 visas on character grounds since 2014, keeping Australians safe from the triads, mafia gangs and bikies who seek to ply their deadly trade in our community. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Simply, the coalition government did not tolerate noncitizens who engage in criminal activity or behaviour of concern, including involvement with outlaw motorcycle gangs and organised crime, and acted decisively to protect the community from the risk of harm posed by these individuals. We supported the department and Australian Border Force to work closely with law enforcement agencies to identify and, where appropriate, cancel or refuse the visas of noncitizens engaging in organised criminal activity or associating with criminal gangs and ensure that all noncitizens who wish to enter or remain or remain in Australia must satisfy the requirements of the Migration Act 1958 and the Migration Regulations 1994, including the character test at section 501 of that act. A noncitizen may not pass the character test on a number of grounds, including but not limited to if they have a substantial criminal record or they are suspected of associating with or being a member of the group involved in criminal conduct. Further, a noncitizen's visa must be cancelled if they are serving a full term of imprisonment for an offence committed in Australia or they have at any time been sentenced to a period of 12 months or more in prison.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If a visa is cancelled in these circumstances, the person may apply to the minister for revocation of the visa cancellation decision. The minister has personal powers enabling them to cancel or refuse a visa without notice where it is considered in the national interest to do so. Noncitizens who do not hold a valid visa will be liable for detention and removal from Australia, pending resolution of any ongoing matters. All removals are carried out in a way that ensures the safety and security of those individuals being removed, staff and the public. Removals from Australia are undertaken as soon as reasonably practicable through both voluntary and, unfortunately, sometimes involuntary pathways. As I've just said, we not only put these protections in place but used them, because no good comes from losing control over our borders. From December 2014 to February this year, 335 outlaw motorcycle gang members, associates or organised crime members had their visas cancelled and or refused under the character and general cancellation powers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This was real, practical action to keep Australians safe that the previous coalition government undertook, and Labor must follow suit. I note the Prime Minister has said he will be more lenient when it comes to allowing New Zealand criminals to stay in Australia. For the victims of crimes committed by these people I think that's a very difficult statement to hear. The Prime Minister needs to provide more details about which criminals he will allow to remain in our country and why. The coalition will continue to hold Labor to account on its approach to our borders and crime from opposition, because we've seen their track record on these important issues, and it hasn't been good enough. For another example, I'll talk about the backflip in relation to firearms trafficking before the last election. For five years Labor objected to tougher penalties under new national gun laws for organised crime syndicates, outlaw motorcycle gangs and other criminals who trafficked firearms—finally backing down, though, at the start of this year and supporting the legislation. It's astounding that it did take five years to come to the realisation that Australia and Australians need to be protected and want to be protected and that importation of illegal firearms was something the community indeed needed to be protected from.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll stress very much why this has been such a core principle of coalition governments past. Law and order is absolutely the bedrock of our society. Without it, the basic agreements we have as individuals fall apart. Our people, the Australian people, need to know that at all levels support is there—here as legislators, making sure that the legislation we're doing is up to date, addressing threats as they occur in our time, and that we are, as in the case of this legislation, making sure the penalties applied meet community expectations. They also need to know our courts have not only the tools they need but the willingness to use them, and the Australian people need to know our law enforcement agencies have the support from all levels to do their job and to keep us safe. We're blessed in this country to have fantastic law enforcement agencies, as I'm sure every member of this House would agree. It's very important that we maintain laws in place to support them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To wrap up, I think the key point I'd offer on this is that the punishment must fit the crime. It's important that we take steps to make sure that we're keeping up with community expectations. It's important we take steps to understand new crimes and threats that are coming through, and it's very important we find ways to address the profits that crime lives and thrives off. When we can do that, we know we can cut away at it, and we can remove as much of this scourge as we can from our society.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="L6B" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr FLETCHER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bradfield</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Manager of Opposition Business</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:37</span>):  I rise to speak on the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Information Disclosure, National Interest and Other Measures) Bill 2022. Access to a person's mobile phone location data, known as triangulation, can mean the difference between life and death. Last year, according to the Australian Federal Police National Missing Persons Coordination Centre, more than 53,000 people were reported missing—about 145 a day. In many of these cases law enforcement and emergency services agencies turn to the telecommunications carriers for vital mobile phone location data. With more than 20 million Australians estimated to own a mobile phone, location data can and does save lives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While the telcos cannot provide precise GPS data or exact coordinates, they are able to provide approximate location information, based on triangulation of a mobile phone relative to mobile transmission towers. The quality of this information is now considerably better than it was thanks to the introduction of advanced mobile location under the previous coalition government, as I will return to. The data cannot be used to verify exactly where a person was at a particular time, but it can establish—sometimes to quite a degree of precision—the location where a person may have gone missing. This is critical information for police or emergency services personnel when searching for a person who has been reported missing or who is at risk of harm.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Part 13 of the Telecommunications Act sets out strict rules for telecommunications carriers, carriage service providers and others in their use and disclosure of personal information. Currently under section 287 of the act, telecommunications companies can only help to triangulate a missing person if a threat to a person's life or health is 'serious and imminent'. The bill would remove the word 'imminent' making it easier for law enforcement agencies and emergency services organisations to access triangulation information. While removing the word 'imminent', the bill adds an important safeguard which is that the entity or person being asked to disclose the information needs to be satisfied that 'it is unreasonable or impracticable to obtain the other person's consent to the proposed disclosure or use.' </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A recommendation was made in 2008 to the then Labor government by the Australian Law Reform Commission—in a report entitled <span style="font-style:italic;">For </span><span style="font-style:italic;">y</span><span style="font-style:italic;">our </span><span style="font-style:italic;">i</span><span style="font-style:italic;">nformation: Australian </span><span style="font-style:italic;">p</span><span style="font-style:italic;">rivacy </span><span style="font-style:italic;">l</span><span style="font-style:italic;">aw and </span><span style="font-style:italic;">p</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ractice (ALRC Report 108)</span> and tabled in August 2008—that the requirement that a threat be imminent was inappropriate. At that time, the Australian Law Reform Commission recommended 'imminent' be repealed, expressing the view that any analysis of whether a threat is serious must involve consideration of the gravity of the potential outcome as well as the relative likelihood. While most recommendations from this report were adopted, the then Labor government decided not to implement that recommendation. The intention of the bill before the House now, as the Minister for Communications stated in her second reading speech, is that it is targeted not only to improve the operation and transparency of the relationship between law enforcement and the telcos but also, crucially, to save lives. In view of the importance of saving lives, it is regrettable that the then Labor government did not take action at the time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is regrettable that this recommendation lay dormant until the urgent need for law reform was raised by the New South Wales deputy state coroner in a letter to the Minister for Communications in October 2022. This followed a coronial inquest into the sad disappearance of a New South Wales resident, which found that law enforcement agencies could not characterise the threat to life and health as 'imminent', meaning no location data could be accessed, which it is feared contributed to the loss of a life. In the minister's second reading speech she referenced a 2020 New South Wales coronial inquest into the death of a man which raised similar concerns. However, my colleague the shadow minister for communications, Senator Henderson, sought information in a briefing from the department of communications as to whether there had been any correspondence sent by the coroner at the time to the Commonwealth government requesting such an amendment to the act, and she was advised that there was no such correspondence sent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important to point out that, as reported by the Australian Communications and Media Authority, some 25,410 disclosures of personal information were made by the telcos in the last financial year for the purpose of averting a threat to a person's life or health. This bill contains other measures to support public safety by permitting the use and disclosure of unlisted numbers stored within the Integrated Public Number Database, or IPND, which a database of all Australian phone numbers and associated names and addresses. Currently, the IPND manager is prevented under the act from providing a triple 0 emergency service with a name and address of a caller from an unlisted number. Given that 95 per cent of the 72 million mobile phone numbers in Australia are unlisted, and that mobile phone numbers are unlisted by default, this does present a significant barrier to providing life-saving help when a caller is unable to provide details of their location. Allowing triple 0 services to access unlisted phone number information will save lives. The bill also clarifies a number of other matters, including that telecommunications companies, when providing reasonable and necessary assistance to emergency services organisations, are not liable for damages when acting in good faith.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill builds on important work by the former coalition government, which rolled out advanced mobile location—or AML—technology, which is built into the operating systems of both Apple and Android telephones. This provides greater location accuracy to triple 0 services during an emergency call from a mobile telephone. Following extensive work by the previous government over many months, AML became available to Australians calling triple 0 from a mobile phone in December 2020. By August 2021, the rollout was complete across all states and territories. AML has already been used to save lives. For example, in South Australia the technology helped emergency services locate two kayakers caught in strong winds three kilometres offshore, which eliminated the need for an expensive air and sea search. Triple 0 receives up to 27,000 calls nationally each day, and around 78 per cent of these calls originate from a mobile phone, so accurate location data is critical.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to thank all of those in my former office, in the department, in the working group that was established to bring together representatives of emergency services and in the various departments and agencies with policy responsibility for communications for all the work that was done to implement advanced mobile location. This work has been enormously important and has undoubtedly saved lives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While the opposition supports the objectives of this bill for the reasons I have given, we do recognise that there are some privacy concerns that have been raised in relation to the provisions of the bill. More broadly, we recognise the critical need to protect the privacy and personal data of all Australians. It is very important therefore to make sure that this bill does not give rise to any unintended consequences. A question which arises, for example, is whether the bill provides adequate safeguards for a person fleeing family violence under circumstances where the perpetrator might make a false missing person report with the aim of securing information about the whereabouts of the victim-survivor. The opposition is concerned that the government has not consulted sufficiently on this point in relation to this bill, including with family violence organisations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our concerns were increased by what we learnt through questioning on this matter in Senate estimates on 23 November. It is for this reason that the opposition supported a motion to refer this bill to the Environment and Communications Legislation Committee for inquiry and report by March 2023—that is to say, it is important that this matter be carefully considered to ascertain whether there are appropriate safeguards within the bill against breaches of privacy and personal data that could, particularly in the case of victims-survivors of domestic violence, put people in danger. That is a question which does need to be properly examined and answered.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I conclude, firstly, by referring to the strong record of this side of the House when it comes to increasing the safety of Australians by making better data available in relation to the location of those who are at risk, and, secondly, by indicating the opposition's awareness of and, in the broad, support for the objectives of this bill. I note only our concern about privacy issues and wanting to be satisfied that these issues are properly worked through, including through the Senate committee process.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Sturt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:47</span>):  I join my colleague the member for Bradfield in expressing support for the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Information Disclosure, National Interest and Other Measures) Bill 2022, but I'll put on the record a few points about caution in this area.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To begin with I'll mention, very proudly, that Fivecast, a business from my electorate, was successful at the Australian Export Awards held here in Parliament House last Thursday night. That business does a lot of work with law enforcement agencies as far as receiving data and using publicly accessible sources to help and support law enforcement agencies in a variety of things that they do. One really heartening example of things they are a part of is the recent search for the little girl in Western Australia who was kidnapped and, thankfully, found safely some days later. They were involved in supporting Western Australian police by providing them with intelligence services that led to the location of that little girl. One of the things that was helpful was mobile phone data and information.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We certainly agree that there's a need to change the law to give better, clearer and cleaner access to data that can help save lives. Obviously, there's complete unity in this chamber on that objective. My brief word of caution is that, every time we have these bills to modernise laws regarding new and emerging technology that can be used to help law enforcement do their job, we should be wary that there's the right justification for providing those powers, and that they stop at the point that is necessary and don't ever creep further.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are talking about personal data and information about people which, as we all know, is extremely topical in this country right now. There is a lot of wariness about people's data falling into the wrong hands and then being used against people. Regrettably, right now we're seeing blackmail and extortion of people and companies. Customer information of a personal nature is taken from companies, and these companies are being threatened with significant consequences. The victims are not the companies; the victims are the people whose data is being released publicly with the object of embarrassing them. We've seen that with the Medicare and Optus matters, and unfortunately there is a significant risk of it continuing to happen into the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When we're adjusting the law, as we are in this case, to give smoother, cleaner and more comprehensive access to data on people that in the past has been protected, we want to do that for the right reasons. The reasons for these amendments are the right reasons, but we as a parliament always need to be vigilant and wary, when the executive—the government—the department and others put forward these proposals, that the changes, the new powers that are being asked for, meet the requirements we expect. I am wary about making sure that into the future we are always very careful about law changes that are going to put more information about people into the public realm.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those concerns have been outlined by the Manager of Opposition Business. He has also made it very clear that the previous government was in support of this legislation. For that reason, we are very comfortable with supporting this amendment bill through the chamber. I clarify that we will always be very wary about requests to make it easier for information on the citizens of our country to be kept and passed on, but in this case the reasons for the change are valid and meritorious. We certainly hope that these changes will make it easier for our agencies to save lives. If we do nothing more than that in this place today, it will have been a good day's work at the office. I commend the bill to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Monash</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:53</span>):  Deputy Speaker, isn't new technology fantastic? It can do amazing things. I had a friend talk to me about a woman who was worried about her husband because he was late home from work and he had never before been late home from work. She rang the local police and said, 'I'm really worried about my husband.' Somehow, the police did a 'Where's my phone?'—I don't know how they do that—and located his car. He had pulled over near a beach—he must have been feeling unwell—and sadly, while he was overlooking the beach, had died of a heart attack. That was sad, but the new technology used by local police found him very, very quickly, and that side of the story is great.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I heard of a crime case in Melbourne, going back a few years now, where a person of interest was able to be traced by the cross-checking of phone towers to see where that person's phone had travelled on a particular day. That person was identified as the person that the police were looking for in regard to a murder or some other terrible situation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have not got a problem with using fantastic new technology for the benefit of society—and I say 'the benefit'. As the shadow minister pointed out in his remarks,145 people a day go missing in Australia. We charge our police and other emergency services to go out and, hopefully, find those people. They do so, hopefully, having full regard of the legislation that covers their responsibilities. It has been outlined by the government very clearly that there are safeguards in this, but in truth we are giving police and other emergency services more freedom to access people's data more easily. This is your data. You own this data. You own your phone. You hope you're being listened to or covered or identified. But I have maps on my phone. You can tell where I am any time you like by just looking at these maps to see where my car is or where my phone is. Deputy Speaker Vamvakinou, you can see whether my phone is next to your phone when you come to my office to have a chat, or I go to your office. People can tell where those two phones are at any given time, so everybody knows when we've met. We don't have to broadcast it or tell anybody because our phone data will tell people when we're having a discussion. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Are there enough safeguards in this legislation? Our Public Service and our government believe that, yes, they have covered the ground through the Privacy Act, or they have done their best to give direction to the agencies as to how they can act in this regard. This bill takes out the word 'imminent' if someone is under threat immediately or imminently. Taking it out gives greater freedom to the agencies to investigate a particular situation. We should think that's all good because it saves lives when it finds people. They might have found a man who had a heart attack earlier. Had they had found him, could they have saved him? Sometimes, yes, sometimes, no. But we'd have the ability to use this new technology in the best interests of our nation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I believe the drafters of this legislation have put in place safeguards for our nation's and our people's best interest. But they should remember that, in doing so, they have handed more power to police or other agencies to use this power for good. I believe that people will always use this for good in the best interests of investigating a difficult situation. But I also have in the back of my mind that there may be those who will not use this information in the nation's best interest when investigating difficult issues. They might use it to their personal advantage to find out about someone, their movements, where they go, what they do, which is entirely inappropriate. It could be seen by some as a creeping infringement on their right to privacy. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">How do you balance that? Well, I don't know how to balance that. You take the new technology and say: 'Here, we've got this fantastic new technology. We can now do things we've never been able to do before.' But is that a creeping interference on the freedoms of the individual in Australia—freedom of association, freedom of expression? Have we taken into account enough that, if we need a judge to make a decision as to whether someone can access someone else's privacy, that takes time? We can get a senior police officer to make a decision. Well, they're busy. They're going to say, 'Yes, tick. Do what you've got to do.' As an individual I am particularly concerned that, if these powers are not used correctly, it's a definite infringement on the privacy of the individuals concerned.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But when you have a situation where 145 people a day go missing in Australia, which I thought was a staggering number—145 people decide they're going to disappear in a day, in 26 million people—that's thousands and thousands over a year and over two, three or four years. Out of 26 million Australians some 20 million have a mobile phone or two, and those mobile phones can be tracked anywhere at any time by anybody, apparently—not by anybody, because my use of technology would not be able to find you in the building, let alone in the broader world.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But there are a number of pieces of legislation including digital identity, and now I find out that I have to have a particular digital identity for an individual business, as well as the director—as well as, as well as, as well as. So government seems to be encroaching on my identity in more ways than I consider reasonable at this time. Every bit of legislation that comes through this place has the best intentions. At the same time, I didn't need a digital identity six months ago to be a director of my self-managed super fund, small as it is, but now I have to have a digital identity. If I don't have it by the end of the month, I'll get a $13,000 fine for not having a digital identity, and I don't want this type of legislation to be encroaching and encroaching and encroaching, evermore.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Through this genuine legislation, people are saying, 'No, this is new technology. We can use it so well to find out where people are and what they're doing, especially if they're doing the wrong thing by the nation.' But then we've got to temper that with the freedoms that are so precious to the Australian people. You do that through legislation just like this, so we actually change it to address new technology. There'll be more new technology that comes through; there's absolutely no doubt about that. In fact, where we've come from, just in my lifetime, let alone my father's lifetime, massive changes have happened and are happening with a rapidity and an energy that I don't think any of us could have believed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When I first had a mobile phone, it was a brick battery about that high and sat in a great dumpster in the middle of the car. A close friend of mine rang me, and I said, 'Where are you?' He said, 'I'm just driving out of Darwin,' so here I was on this mobile phone in Cranbourne with somebody ringing me from Darwin in the car. I remember Peter Boyle had this joke. He used to get off the phone and say, 'Excuse me, my other phone's ringing in the car.' They were the days when we were just setting out. Now we do more with our smartphones than they did on NASA's first mission.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Here we stand today in the parliament trying to balance the privacy of the individual against the greater good. We need to be really, really aware of every piece of legislation that comes through that actually reduces the freedom of the individual. We need to be on guard for the protection of our children. My generation? Don't worry about us. But where will this lead to for our children and their children? Are they going to be under surveillance the whole time? Are they going to be recognised by their digital identity when they walk into a supermarket? Are they going to be recognised by what their phone is putting out or on what they purchase? Will it be total control or oversight of what we're doing?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So we as a parliament then have a direct responsibility to act on behalf of the Australian people, to act on behalf of those who cannot act on their own. They will say: 'Mr Broadbent, that's your problem. You're the legislator. You watch that on our behalf. That's what we elected you for.' They elected us on their behalf to watch over the legislation that comes through this place. Do we do it? Am I across every piece of legislation that is going to be passed in this building today, tomorrow or the next day? No. I take an interest in particular pieces of legislation like this one, but do I watch every piece? I watch every piece that is going to have a subtle effect on individuals' freedom in this nation because, if I don't defend it and this parliament doesn't defend it, nobody will.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This may be a cliche for you, but the men and women who died in the First World War and Second World War and all of the other wars that we have been engaged in died under the banner of freedom for this nation. People want to come to this nation by boat or aeroplane—anyway they can get here—because they see this nation as free and the nation they are fleeing from as not free. We are held up as a beacon of freedom. Therefore, in every bit of legislation that comes before this House we have to protect those freedoms. Are they out of hand because of new technology and legislation to then back up that technology? Yes. I don't think we can keep up with what is going on. This legislation is directly reflecting the fact that we can't keep up with new technology and how it may be used or will be used.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If it's used for the greater good, I am all for this legislation and we will be supporting the amendments of this legislation. But fallen into the wrong hands it could be used for the lesser good, not our best selves. That can happen at any organisation. We've seen data breaches over the last two to three months that would frighten anybody, and we are always fearful of that happening in government. So we are supporting the legislation, but we are making sure we have very close regard for the freedoms and privacy of the individuals of this nation.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="288713" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BIRRELL</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Nicholls</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Nationals Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:08</span>):  I am very pleased to rise to speak on the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Information Disclosure, National Interest and Other Measures) Bill 2022. I recognise the importance of this legislation and that in some circumstances access to a missing person's mobile phone location data, known as 'triangulation', can mean the difference between life and death. In fact, it was the coalition that rolled out advanced mobile location, or AML, technology. This technology is embedded in the operating systems of Apple and Android phones to provide greater location accuracy to 000 services, for example, during an emergency call from a mobile telephone. This bill further advances the ability of law enforcement and emergency services agencies to access mobile phone location data. That can be critical when somebody goes missing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This change is subtle but important. The Telecommunications Act includes general prohibitions on carriers and carriage service providers disclosing certain information or documents, including telecommunications data. There are some important exceptions, including where disclosure of this information is 'reasonably necessary to prevent or lessen a serious and imminent threat to life or health of a person'. The removal of the word 'imminent' supports recommendations from a number of state coroners and the Australian Law Reform Commission. The reason its removal was supported is that it set too high a bar for access to location data. So this bill removes the word imminent but also includes an important safeguard—that the entity or person being asked to disclose the information needs to be satisfied if it's unreasonable or impractical to obtain the other person's consent to the proposed disclosure or use.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What else does this bill achieve? The bill also authorises the use and disclosure of unlisted numbers—for example, some mobile phone numbers—and associated addresses for the purpose of dealing with matters raised by a call to an emergency service number. An example of how this will apply is where a caller can't provide the location of an emergency. The bill clarifies that carriers, carriage service providers and carriage service intermediaries will not be liable for damages where such entities are, acting in good faith, providing reasonable and necessary assistance to emergency services organisations. It makes some technical amendments, including clarifying the definition of a telecommunications transmission tower. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In principle, these measures are supported but we believe more work needs to be done. The opposition is concerned that the government has failed to adequately consult on the bill and address legitimate privacy concerns about a proposed change in the law that would make it easier to access somebody's mobile phone location data. Data security, particularly at the moment, is top of mind for many Australians. This year alone we've had a number of major data thefts, including from Optus, which has 9.8 million customers, and Medibank, which has 3.9 million customers. These are the biggest ones, but dozens of companies and institutions have fallen victim to hacking and data theft. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Scams are also flourishing. During Scams Awareness Week, earlier this month, the ACCC's Scamwatch revealed that losses from scams totalled more than $2 billion last year. This year it could reach $4 billion. Scamwatch received more than 166 reports, between January and September this year, showing a 90 per cent increase in losses to $424.8 million over the same period last year. The ACCC's deputy chair, Delia Rickard, said during the week:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Scammers evolve quickly, and their tactics are becoming increasingly sophisticated and unscrupulous. There have been hundreds of reports to Scamwatch in the weeks after the recent high profile data breaches and that is expected to continue … Cyber criminals have capitalised on the data breach by impersonating government departments and businesses to carry out identity theft and remote access scams.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians are being targeted relentlessly by these scammers. We believe the Albanese government must urgently pass new laws to combat scams on online platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and Instagram, including services such as WhatsApp and Messenger. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The former coalition government in December 2020 announced a new industry code, the Reducing Scam Calls Code, which requires telecommunications companies to detect, trace and block scam calls. In November 2021 the coalition made an important regulatory amendment, empowering the telecommunications sector, to identify and block SMS scams at the source. As a result of this work, new rules to identify, trace and block SMS scams came into force in July 2022. These laws have blocked an estimated 800 million scam calls and 48 million SMS scams. The Australian Media and Communications Authority, which administers the scam blocking, needs the power to force the global tech giants to detect, trace and block scams, ensuring companies like Meta, Twitter and Google are more accountable for the harm they are facilitating. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">No sector is immune from this type of behaviour and situations. In October, farmers and small businesses in rural and regional areas were urged to be cautious, particularly when buying heavy machinery, following a spike in scams targeting the agricultural sector this year. And there's concern about this in my own electorate of Nicholls. Reports to the ACCC's Scamwatch show that Australian farm businesses lost more than $1.2 million to scammers between 1 January and 31 August 2022, an increase of more than 20 per cent compared to the same period last year. They can ill afford that at any time but particularly not at the moment, with all the other challenges that regional and rural Australia are facing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians are increasingly sensitive about how their data is managed given the high-profile data thefts that have elevated the risk to millions of Australians of being targeted by scams. It is understandable that the management and security of data has become a top-of-mind issue. The accessing of Australians' data must be appropriately balanced with the need to ensure that their data is properly protected. Accordingly, the opposition is proposing that the bill be referred to a Senate committee for inquiry. It's important that anyone wishing to provide feedback or raise concerns about the bill, including civil liberties groups, has a proper opportunity to do so. So we must be as equally concerned about the misuse of data as we are about allowing access, even if that access is designed to protect people and save lives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition has got a strong track record in telecommunications: we funded more than 1,200 mobile base stations, delivering record investment to support regional connectivity, and improved telecommunications infrastructure for disaster resilience, including in the electorate of Nicholls. The coalition established the world's first eSafety Commissioner, through the Online Safety Act, which extends important online safety protections to adults. We also moved to hold global digital platforms to account, including under the news media bargaining code.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the October budget, Labor cut telecommunications funding and groundbreaking investments in regional connectivity, including in disaster resilience, which once again demonstrates Labor's disregard for rural and regional Australia. Those cuts include a $106 million program to boost resilience and telecommunications infrastructure for natural disasters in vulnerable locations, and a much smaller commitment of $30.4 million has been made for the Department of Home Affairs for resilience initiatives, including infrastructure. It's a heartless decision at a time when so many regional communities are in the grip of a flood disaster.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The $30 million under the coalition that was for various internet affordability measures in regional and rural Australia is now just $4.7 million, and the $5 million for emerging technology trials has been scrapped. The $418 million for open access or multicarrier mobile is now $400 million. The Mobile Black Spot Program has been cut by $37.5 million, the lowest level of investment since 2015. While adopting the coalition's plan to extend the Peri-Urban Mobile Program, or PUMP, to regional cities—as the opposition called for—Labor is providing only half of the $78.5 million amount committed by the coalition.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Rural and regional communities deserve better. We are a vast nation, but that's not an excuse for having a two-tier telecommunication system. I urge the government to ramp up investment in regional telecommunications because the regions are critical to our economy, our exports and our jobs. Blackspots, poor service quality and a lack of access to the latest telecommunications technology are the subject of frequent representations to my office and many offices in regional and remote Australia. Telecommunications in the regions is critical for business and for participation in the digital economy, and it requires constant investment, not cuts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In summary, I support the changes made by this bill, with some reservation regarding the protection of data and the level of consultation to date, and I reaffirm my urging of the government to keep investing in regional and rural telecommunications infrastructure. It's necessary for continuing the modernisation of our agricultural businesses, in moving people who want to work remotely from cities to the regions and for getting the population balance going in our country that we all want to see. I know the member for Bendigo agrees with that desire to see the regional cities in Victoria thrive. Thank you very much.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Casey</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:19</span>):  First, I must echo the sentiments of the member for Nicholls. Like him, we have regional communications challenges in Casey, and it's so important that we continue to invest in connectivity for our farmers and for our residents who live in those agricultural areas. As a regional and peri-urban area, Casey has those challenges. I definitely concur with the member for Nicholls's wonderful contribution.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But today I rise to speak on the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Information Disclosure, National Interest and Other Measures) Bill 2022. In essence, this bill will allow telecommunications companies to more easily provide assistance to law enforcement agencies and emergency service organisations in order to prevent crime and serious life-threatening situations. It's important that we get this legislation right. On a very basic level, these proposals do make a lot of sense, and there are a lot of strong arguments for why we need to implement this legislation, which is why the opposition is going to support these changes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's clear that it's advantageous for emergency services to be able to access location data as quickly as possible when people are missing. We know that, in situations when people are missing, minutes and hours make a significant difference, so it is important that emergency services have all the support they need to protect Australians when they're in danger. But we also need to recognise and acknowledge the threats that exist, particularly in the new digital world that we live in. I'll talk a little bit about the importance of this bill but also about some of the challenges we need to address, because this bill will confer civil immunities on telecommunications companies for the provision of reasonably necessary assistance to the Commonwealth, states or territories to respond during emergencies if a national emergency declaration is made. It's going to amend the existing requirements to record disclosures by telecommunications companies, so it will give more support and more data to those communications companies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've seen, clearly with Optus and Medibank, that our nation faces cybersecurity challenges in protecting our citizens, and we need to acknowledge that they are very real. Whether it's government infrastructure, business data or individual consumer data, the reality is that that data is being attacked every day, and we need to ensure that, if we're giving organisations a greater ability to access this data, it's going to be used in the right way.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, we need to acknowledge in this current environment that bad apples do exist. As much as we wouldn't like it to be the case, there can sometimes be people within organisations that will do the wrong thing and take advantage of having access to that data. We've seen many cases, particularly and shamelessly in domestic violence situations, where location data has been misused. We always need to ensure not only that we are allowing emergency services access to people's locations to find people when they in danger but also that there are appropriate safeguards so that people are looked after and that it's not misused. That's why we need to take our time to make sure we get this right. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is quite important because it highlights the challenges that we face in this House when we're drafting legislation, particularly and primarily regarding technology. It's something that I spoke about in my first speech, having spent the last three years working in the digital economy. The tech and digital environment moves at an extremely fast pace. As we're talking right now, there are a lot of smart people working on new technology and new opportunities that will provide benefits to us as a community, to citizens and to governments, but will also create challenges in this House. We, rightly, have important processes that we need to go through to protect our citizens, and that's why we need to continue to legislate as fast as possible. But we don't want to go too quickly, because, if we get it wrong—like the great old saying—there's no point locking the gate once the horse has bolted. That saying is very true for farmers and cattlemen—there's nothing worse than locking the gates once a horse is out—but it's equally true for technology and data because once your data is available on the internet or the dark web you can't get it back. That's the fact and the reality of what we're dealing with. So if we're allowing organisations to have easier access—even if they are emergency services—unfortunately, we know that there have been people within emergency services throughout history that have misused data before. We need to allow for that risk and to protect that risk, and that's why my belief and that of the opposition is that it is very important that we send this to a Senate committee so it can understand the privacy issues and the data issues. We absolutely support the need for this legislation—that's beyond doubt. What the question is, is: how do we protect our citizens that are missing but also give everyone else the benefit of what they need in terms of their security being protected? The power of this technology access can't be underestimated in terms of tracking where people are and what they're looking to do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill responds to several recommendations, including by the Australian Law Reform Commission and state coroners, about the current drafting of the act, which requires the threat to life or health be imminent. This has hindered the disclosure of information around the disclosure of the location of missing persons in the past, and can be determined by mobile phone triangulation. It's so important that we get that right, and what the definition of 'imminent' is. I know this was subject to a New South Wales deputy coroner recommendation. They wrote to the minister in October of this year, recommending amendments to the act following the inquest into the disappearance of a person in Sydney. There is a strong case for this, but it is important to understand and to recognise that the coroner is looking at how we can prevent this happening again, which is absolutely their responsibility, but they're looking through a very narrow lens of how we stop it happening again. This is the scope of their responsibility, but our responsibility and the minister's responsibility in this House when that recommendation comes in from an expert in a very narrow field is to look and understand what the intended and unintended consequences are of this decision and this change. The reality is that in this House every decision we make has consequences. Many we can predict, but history shows us that there are many unintended consequences. As I said before, we know with the digital world that if we get these things wrong and the unintended consequences happen, we can't change it. We can't go back in time and unlock that change. That's why it's so important that a Senate committee looks at this, hears from experts around the privacy challenges that we face and makes sure that we are protecting people at both levels of this process.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important that we do have access to missing people's mobile phone location data. Technology has allowed us to use triangulation to find people, and it is a great asset that we do have in the current modern world. That's why the coalition rolled out the advanced mobile location technology to provide greater location accuracy to triple 0 services during an emergency call from a mobile phone. That was something that the coalition were proud to pull out in their time in government to save lives and make a difference. This bill does build on that work by making it easier for law enforcement and emergency service agencies to access mobile phone data which can be critical. The Telecommunications Act includes the general prohibitions on carriers and carrier services disclosing certain information or documents, including telecommunications data. However, there are some important exceptions, including where disclosure of this information is reasonably necessary to prevent or lessen a serious and imminent threat to the life or health of a person. This goes to the heart of this discussion and how we get the balance right. This is a tricky conversation, because the world 'imminent'—which is the one that is being proposed to be taken out—does make a lot of sense and reflects the concerns of the state coroners and the Australian Law Reform Commission that the qualifier is creating too high a threshold on access to mobile phone location data.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also allows for the use of disclosure of unlisted numbers if someone calls an emergency services number and, for example, can't provide a location of an emergency. There are some really important initiatives here, clarifying that service providers and telecommunication providers and intermediaries will not be liable for damages when they act in good faith in providing reasonable and necessarily assistance to emergency services organisations. Notwithstanding that, the opposition is concerned that the government has failed to adequately consult—</span>

The latest terrible incident is the arrest and jailing of Chhim Sithar, the leader of the union at NagaWorld casino. I'm personally shocked by this. Sithar is a terrific young woman, who I had a coffee with only eight days ago in Melbourne. When she got off the plane in Cambodia, she was arrested on the pretext that she was not supposed to travel overseas, as it was a breach of her bail conditions. Of course, no-one had ever told her of this condition. It's nonsense.</span>

She was jailed for standing up for the rights of 1,300 workers illegally stood down from the NagaWorld casino, which is owned by a Malaysian billionaire with rumoured but unproven links to Blackstone, which own Crown casino. She was just asking for proper severance pay or reinstatement in vacant jobs for the few who still want to work there.</span>

When we had a chat she wasn't plotting the overthrow of Hun Sen's gangster regime and she wasn't trying to bring down capitalism or end corruption in Cambodia; she was simply chatting about being in Melbourne and the challenges that she shares with other trade union organisers worldwide.</span>

I acknowledge the emergency services volunteers in particular and those who are likely to have a very busy summer ahead—and I think all in this place would agree. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The volunteer bushfire and emergency services brigades are likely to face a really challenging summer ahead. They put countless hours into this role. And there are the marine rescue people, the fabulous St John Ambulance volunteers and our surf lifesaving clubs, who work so hard over summer to reduce coastal drownings. They are very involved in safety and rescues right around the coast. They spend countless hours on patrol to help keep us all safe. I look at the young people they bring through surf lifesaving. It offers a wonderful opportunity for those young people not only to become such an important part of our community but also to take an active role in helping keep other Australians safe. My Christmas message to everyone is to stay safe on our roads and in and around water this festive season. Please have a thought for the volunteers who will be working on Christmas Day, when, hopefully, most of us will be enjoying our day.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hasluck</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:35</span>):  Today I stand to speak in solidarity with retail distribution and transport workers across the country. In the wake of the Black Friday sales, I lend my voice in chorus with the SDA, the TWU and the entire union movement to say no to poor working conditions and low wages in Australia.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the weekend, we have seen Amazon workers hit the streets to protest their appalling treatment in Argentina, Austria, Bangladesh, Belgium, Brazil, Cambodia, Canada, Czech Republic, France, Germany, Hungary, India, Japan, the Netherlands, Poland, Slovakia, South Africa, Turkey, the UK and the USA. Amazon is global, and so are its horrifying workplace practices. Amazon squeezes workers. Real wages are going down while the corporation rakes in revenue of record proportions—$121 billion for the second quarter of 2022—all while doubling down on union-busting tactics. Amazon squeezes communities, for example by paying no income tax in Europe in 2021. Instead, Amazon was paid one billion euros in tax credits on 55 billion euros in sales. Amazon squeezes our planet. Despite including only one per cent of all product sales in its carbon accounting, the corporation's CO2 emissions rose by 18 per cent in 2021.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, I am proud to stand with the Australian trade union movement, which is standing up for a fair go for workers, because nothing is more important than a secure job and a decent wage. Make Amazon pay.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Indi</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:36</span>):  Today I'm reading a speech written by my Indi Youth Advisory Panel on behalf of our young people as part of our Raise Our Voice Australia program. Here is their message:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Affording to live is increasingly difficult. Prices of everything are going up, and everyone is grappling with this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Many full-time students cannot work the hours needed to subsidise these soaring costs, particularly those on low wages. They are fed up with the rapidly increasing price of uni accommodation—not to mention essentials like fruit and veggies.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">NEVER has there been a more legitimate reason to live off the two-minute noodles.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Young people are concerned for their futures—experiencing a lack of hope and ambition. The social divisions and economic brackets are restricting our access and eligibility to various benefit schemes designed to help us.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We feel that governments have lost focus on preparing Australia for future generations when it comes to the 'cost of living' issues. Not enough people or communities are thriving in modern Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">So, Mr Speaker, young people call on this parliament to get a grip on the economic challenges that are impeding the prosperity of future generations. And to act immediately to raise benefit schemes like Rent Assistance and Youth Allowance in line with inflation.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Boothby</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:38</span>):  November is Lung Cancer Awareness Month. Lung cancer is the most common cancer in the world and the most common cause of death by cancer. Over 14,000 Australians will be diagnosed with lung cancer this year, resulting in over 8,500 deaths. The five-year survival rate for a diagnosis of lung cancer is only 22 per cent. Smoking is associated with up to 90 per cent of lung cancer diagnoses, but it's not the only cause. Other causes include exposure to asbestos, air pollution and workplace hazards, including fumes and dust particles from industrial processes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another risk factor is family history. This latter issue is close to my heart. My primary school best friend, Kathryn Esselbach, died last year from lung cancer, leaving behind her husband, Ed Latham, and two teenage children, Hayley and Peter. She was 54, and she'd been diagnosed only 18 months earlier. Kathy was not a smoker and had never been a smoker, nor was anyone in her household. However, her mother, who had also never been a smoker, died of lung cancer in 2009, aged only 64. Her only symptom was a mild upper back pain after a virus. Four months later, she had passed.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As with so many cancers, early diagnosis is key, but lung cancer can be symptomless until too late. I encourage listeners to support lung cancer research to stop this insidious disease.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Warringah</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:39</span>):  A number of schools in Warringah have invited me to hear ideas their students have for climate and environmental innovation. I visited Mackellar Girls Campus in Manly Vale to hear from the year 10 students who have been working on local solutions to global problems. I was most impressed with their presentations and concepts, including basalt sculptures to tackle ocean acidification, tackling microplastics on beaches and water management solutions for flood affected areas. I visited Redlands in Cremorne to hear from students in years 7 and 8 for their Red-X event. The year 7s were challenged to address the future of transport, talking on problems like road congestion, fuel options, safety and the environment. The year 8 students were tasked with developing concepts to tackle threats to our oceans, including pollution, ocean warming and overfishing. What impressed me most were the creativity, passion and can-do attitude as well as the solutions the students came up with. With students as passionate and engaged as these young people were, I'm excited to see where these talents will take them. No doubt we will see some wonderful researchers, marine scientists and social entrepreneurs amongst them. I encourage them to stay curious and continue to follow their passions. They absolutely will solve our problems of tomorrow. </span>

A fortnight ago I had the opportunity to witness Multicultural Youth Support Services' incredible homework club at Tulliallan Primary School in my electorate. This program helps to improve English, math and science scores at school and to reduce disadvantages faced due to their parents' limited experience with the Australian education system. MYSS focuses on addressing youth disengagement and barriers to inclusiveness among African-origin youth in the south-eastern suburbs of Melbourne. It was founded by Peter Aguto, a humanitarian entrant from South Sudan who wants to make sure other African-origin youth do not face the same difficulties he once did. This is through a range of initiatives aimed at providing holistic support which complements every aspect of an individual's life, including regular sporting activities, education about mental health and employment services such as resume help and information about job paths. For this incredible work MYSS was awarded the 2021 Community Group of the Year Award by the City of Casey. I was pleased to nominate them for funding through the Holt volunteers program. </span>

The Murray-Darling Medical Schools Network was announced in the 2018 budget, and included the establishment of a rural medical school in Wagga Wagga, administered by the University of New South Wales. I was proud on Friday to officially turn the first sod with the University of New South Wales Vice-Chancellor and President, Professor Attila Brungs. A rural medical school has been one of my primary goals since entering this place. Soon after being elected member for Riverina in 2010, I helped establish an implementation committee. On that committee were Gerard Carroll AM and Dr Nick Stephenson. They have been tireless in their efforts to help me and others to achieve this goal. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The very first thing I did when I became the Deputy Prime Minister was to establish the medical schools network, and this comprises schools in Dubbo, Orange, Wagga Wagga, Bendigo, Mildura and Shepparton. We know that, if students train in the regions from start to finish, they're more likely to practise in the regions, to stay in the regions and to be retained by the regions because they'll fall in love with the communities, they'll fall in love with the people and they might even fall in love with somebody in that community. That will be a reason for them to stay in the $21 million three-storey Wagga Wagga medical school. It will include undercover parking and will form part of the base hospital precinct. It's a great outcome for the regions and great outcome for Wagga Wagga. </span>

The VALO Adelaide 500 is the largest domestic motorsport event in Australia. </span>

South Australian Labor has a longstanding record of supporting motor racing in South Australia, first by bringing the Formula One to Australia in 1985, and then with the Adelaide 500, which has been going for almost two decades. I congratulate the South Australian Premier on delivering on his election commitment and getting the race back on track, which I know will bring so much excitement and so many visitors to Adelaide, with more than 250,000 people expected to attend the Supercars season finale. I have no doubt that all of those who attend will not be disappointed.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lindsay</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:45</span>):  I'm concerned about the rise of vaping that is sweeping through our schools. It's our responsibility as parliamentarians and parents to care for our young people, and that includes stronger policy focused on prevention strategies and campaigning with government, academics, healthcare professionals and teachers to stop vaping. Despite the huge uptake of vaping, there aren't many studies on its long-term impacts, unlike on the well-known damage and cancers caused by cigarettes. We do know that many vapes contain nicotine, making them addictive; we do know that vapes contain harmful chemicals that are often found in cleaning products, nail polish remover, weed killer and even bug spray; and we do know that kids are vaping in the toilets at school, in the playground and in the sports change rooms.</span>

                  </span>Earlier this year, the New South Wales chapter of the AMA, the Australian Medical Association, released a study of students, teachers and parents relating to vaping at a Western Sydney school. The study found that teachers believed between 20 per cent and 60 per cent of students were vaping. Students from all year groups were known to be vaping, and many were doing so at school. Direct social media marketing, peer pressure and seeing older students vaping is linked to a growth in students vaping. I'm hearing of smoke alarms being removed from the toilets at school and students corralling in the bathrooms to vape. The AMA study found that teachers locking toilets during class time reduced vaping. Schools should not have to use this extreme approach to curb— <span style="font-style:italic;">(time expired)</span></span>

The race to the bottom on wages and secure jobs is a global problem, with Amazon a leading example of it. Amazon drivers aren't getting minimum wage, have no rights and are pressured to drive dangerously overloaded cars just to not be sacked. While profits soar for Amazon, workers are left with little or no pay rises and working unimaginable hours. Workers are often too afraid to speak out or join a union, as they fear retaliation from the company.</span>

                  </span>As the unions representing Amazon workers, the SDA and the TWU are calling for an end to poor working conditions for these workers and are asking Australians to send Amazon a message this Christmas. The SDA has long worked to lift safety standards on Amazon sites, and the TWU is protecting safe standards for transport workers, including drivers. I want to give a massive shoutout to the national president, Ian Smith, from TWU SA/NT, for his work, including the big rally down in Adelaide recently. I support their call for Amazon to pay their workers fair wages and to provide safe working conditions. Just remember in the lead-up to Christmas: no-one deserves a serve for doing their job. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Flinders</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:48</span>):  The weekend's election result in Victoria has, again, many lessons for the centre-right side of Australian politics. While there is an argument that both major parties are losing their appeal at the ballot box, we have work to do in demonstrating to all Australians of all ages and backgrounds that we understand their needs and priorities. The standout result on Saturday night was secured by my friend Sam Groth. Before politics, Sam was a professional tennis player, and his spectacular sporting career gave him discipline, determination and endurance, which are a marvel to behold. He then joined the Australian media as a commentator and host of <span style="font-style:italic;">Postcards</span>, celebrating Victorian destinations, including the magical Mornington Peninsula, where he now resides with his beautiful wife, Britt, and their two delicious and hilarious twin boys, Mason and Parker.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Like so many of our fellow Victorians, Sam struggled with the Andrews government's approach to the pandemic, watching small businesses do it tough across Victoria, especially at home, where we found ourselves included in metro-Melbourne lockdowns despite our vast open spaces and low-density population. Sam reached out to the Liberal Party during the pandemic, and the rest is history. Over the last year, Sam has worked tirelessly in his pursuit to represent the people of Nepean, from Safety Beach, across to Merricks and down to the tip of Point Nepean National Park. He has been a ferocious advocate for infrastructure and health improvements, gaining commitments from a future Liberal government to $340 million for the Rosebud Hospital and $175 million for the completion of the Jetty Road overpass. On Saturday night, Sam secured a seven per cent swing to secure the seat of Nepean by 56.3 per cent. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macquarie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:50</span>):  I rise to express the Hawkesbury community's dismay at the torturous process of restoring Cornwallis and Settlers roads following damage from successive floods. Farmers and turf-growers relying on access via Cornwallis Road in Richmond have suffered nearly two years of misery, not helped by delays in repairing the initial damage last year which led to greater damage this year and land lost forever.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They're now waiting on a decision of the New South Wales government on the escalated cost. The decision has been imminent for weeks. It's impossible to describe the sense of helplessness that affected businesses and families feel. My message to the New South Wales government is: it's time to get this sorted.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many kilometres away at Wisemans Ferry is the landslide-affected Settlers Road. When I visited Settlers and Walmsley roads at the weekend, flood-damaged homes lay empty or were under repair. Their owners are trying to get back to some sort of normal. They live with the expectation that a proper repair of Settlers Road needs to happen and that access could be cut for many months.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've asked the mayor and the state member to investigate the viability of alternative access and water access to ease their pain. Commitments were made by the New South Wales Premier that he'd do all it takes to restore these communities' access. It's time to stump up. And I'll argue for whatever federal support is needed to make that happen.</span>

Every day we don't progress, it costs our community and our economy. For both, road infrastructure is critical. It costs our 777 Wide Bay healthcare businesses delivering care to the vulnerable, disabled and elderly, and our 2,472 construction businesses, which need to be on site to repair and build new homes. Our fight to fix this notorious section of the Bruce Highway will not be over until the four-lane Tiaro bypass opens to traffic.</span>

Sadly, this is not the only Americanism that Amazon is trying to adopt here in Australia. They've also tried to ship their dodgy and dangerous approach to industrial relations to our shores.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the US, Amazon has fought tooth and nail against their workers' right to unionise, in an attempt to keep pay and conditions low. Now, here in Australia, Amazon employees face a very similar attitude. For example, Amazon Flex drivers aren't even given a minimum wage, have no rights and are pressured into driving dangerously-overloaded cars. Amazon warehouse workers also face immense stress, and have, particularly over the past week. There has been enormous pressure to fulfil orders very quickly, despite workers often being employed insecurely by third-party labour-hire companies.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite efforts by Amazon to impede and monitor any union activity, the SDA and the Transport Workers Union—my union—have fought to improve pay and conditions by forming the Online Retail &amp; Delivery Workers Alliance. The SDA and the TWU are working to enforce and lift safety standards, improve wages and ensure that workers are protected in every step of the supply chain. I would like to thank both the SDA and the TWU for standing up for these workers and rejecting the Americanisation of Australian industrial relations.</span>

I've spent my time back home from this place in river communities, helping with flood mitigation efforts. But, as well as the water that's heading to the Riverland, there's another issue that will punish wine and grape producers there. The Riverland is the largest wine region by size, with 20,000 hectares of grapevines. The Riverland's almost 1,000 growers represent a third of the nation's crush.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I wrote to Minister Watt in September, requesting an urgent meeting with the Riverland grape and wine industry to discuss the red wine sector in light of the coercive action of the CCP. After a month of waiting for a reply, the minister responded but, conveniently, completely ignored my request for a meeting. On 16 November, the minister came to South Australia and met with others in the wine industry, but he gave the Riverland and its producers—who are going to be disproportionately affected—a very wide berth. As the federal minister also responsible for emergency management, I would have thought there was cause enough for Minister Watt to visit the Riverland at the moment—but, no. We need to stand shoulder to shoulder with the Riverland industry and its residents and businesses, not turn our backs on them. Minister, leaders are meant to take responsibility and turn up. So why won't you?</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macnamara</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:56</span>):  This weekend we secured an agreement to pass the Fair Work Legislation Amendment (Secure Jobs, Better Pay) Bill 2022. It's the first time in a decade that this place has done something meaningful to lift the wages of hardworking Australians, the first time in a decade that this place has done anything to close the gender pay gap and the first time in a decade that this place has tried to make work more secure for casual employees. These are great labour reforms. And, of course, there are some who cannot bring themselves to support them.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Leader of the Opposition has made it clear that he isn't on the side of working people. He's on another side—and it's not that surprising, given he's been doing some fancy travelling with a mate recently! Gina Rinehart has been the Leader of the Opposition's personal chaperone. On no less than four occasions, the Leader of the Opposition has been jetsetting with Ms Rinehart in her personal aeroplane, including for an exclusive dinner with former attorney-general Christian Porter. Apparently, flying around with Gina and dining with the bloke who hid a million-dollar legal bill from unknown donors are priorities for the Leader of the Opposition, but standing with Australian workers is not. It's clear where this bloke flies, and it's not with the hardworking Australians who deserve a pay increase. But we, on this side of the House, are going to deliver it.</span>

The parliament is not going to be sitting this Friday; instead, the parliament will be brought back by the government to sit on Saturday. And, apparently, one of the reasons is that the Australian Labor Party have organised a fundraiser for themselves on the Friday. It is called the Whitlam anniversary event. Now, isn't that extraordinary!</span>

This Saturday will be 12 months to the day since this Prime Minister first looked the Australian people in the eye and promised them that their household power bills would be reduced by $275. But I tell you what: they're not going to have a fundraiser for that anniversary! They won't be out there celebrating that. They will let Australian businesses and the Australian people live in pain, as they go and celebrate. That's the Labor Party!</span>

I did think he was reading out a list of all the supporters of our climate change policy when he went through that list of the Australian Industry Group, the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and the Business Council of Australia. He left out the National Farmers Federation, who also support our climate policy. I addressed the Australian Industry Group last Monday night for dinner. They were all there. I got seven questions. I got questions about the relationship with trade. I got questions about the Voice, which, by the way, the Australian Industry Group support. I got questions about the republic. Do you want to know how many questions I got about wages? One. This Wednesday night over in the Great Hall I'll be the guest speaker of the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, so if you're not doing anything Wednesday night, Pete, come past and you'll hear about our engagement with the business community. </span>

                  </a>  One of the things we know when it comes to economics and the big calls is that low wages have been holding back our economy. How do we know that? This is what people have spoken about. The RBA Governor—a fellow who might know something about the economy—said, 'The crisis is really in real wage growth.' When speaking about whether there would be higher wages in the future, he said, 'If that were to happen it would be a good thing.' He said that in 2017. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just to make sure it wasn't a one-off comment: in 2018 he said, in an address to the Australian Industry Group, 'These concerns are being brought into sharp focus by unusually slow growth in wages.' Then he went on to say, 'Wages growth has not responded in the way that it once did.' He went on to say, 'It is clear that the slow growth in wages is affecting our economy.' In November 2018, in an address to CEDA, he said:</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… flat real wages are diminishing our sense of shared prosperity. The lack of real wage growth is one of the reasons why some in our community question whether they are benefiting from our economic success. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We believe in an economy that works for people, not the other way around. It's a fundamental distinction that we have. We stand by our position and, indeed, the Leader of the National Party said just a couple weeks ago when asked if he would concede that wages didn't rise while he was in government: 'Well, real wages didn't, and that's structurally a challenge we're all facing. It takes structural change.' We're going to deliver that change. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

In our first six months we have moved Australia forward, after a decade of delay, denial and inaction under the previous government. Already we're delivering on what the Australian people voted for. We've made child care cheaper. We'll make medicines cheaper. We've increased the minimum wage and secured a pay rise for aged-care workers. We've established new climate targets. We've repaired our international relations. This week we're setting about delivering on more of our commitments.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just this morning we were able to pass through the parliament, having accepted the amendments of the Senate, the respect at work legislation. Two years ago women, in their many thousands, marched not only on parliament here but also around the country to say enough is enough, to say that we need to act to ensure that all workplaces are safe and respectful. Today's legislation will do that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This week we're also committed to advancing the National Anti-Corruption Commission legislation that has already passed this House. It may well be that the opposition and the minor parties combine to try to stifle that, but we're determined to have a National Anti-Corruption Commission based upon the legislation that passed this House, that this House unanimously voted for.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We'll also move to advance our secure jobs, better pay bill. We know those opposite, before they'd even read the legislation, decided to oppose it once they heard the title. They're not in favour of secure jobs and they're certainly not in favour of better pay. But what this will do is get wages moving. It will close the gender pay gap, it will ban pay secrecy clauses, it will advance the interests of working people and make sure that we have an economy that works for people not the other way around.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We'll also report to parliament this week on Closing the Gap and we'll report on the first annual climate statement in accordance with the legislation that we passed earlier this year. Australians have made it clear, after a wasted decade, that they want a government that won't waste a day, and that is what we are delivering. We're determined to be worthy of the trust that has been placed in us. We have a mandate to secure change. Australians voted for that change and that is what the Labor government will be delivering.</span>

Can the minister advise the House whether the Albanese government will provide direct financial compensation for small businesses to deal with this financial hit, or will Labor force small businesses to cop the bill themselves?</span>

I thank the member for the question. It's clear from the negotiations that have been going on for some time, and that continued over the course of the weekend, that this week the secure jobs, better pay bill will become law. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to take the House through some of the amendments that have been agreed to by the government in the negotiations both with the Greens and with Senator David Pocock. While consultation continues with all crossbenchers, I want to go through what has now been agreed and what secures passage of the bill. I thank the member for Melbourne and Senator Barbara Pocock for the negotiations that have been taking place, which will lead to amendments that make sure—with respect to some further amendments to the 'better off overall' test—that it will still be becoming simpler and fairer. These specific amendments will make sure there is no a guarantee that no worker can be worse off. I also acknowledge the amendments on something Senator Barbara Pocock has pushed for a very long time which is to improve flexibility at workplaces, including arbitration on unpaid parental leave.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments to the bill that Senator David Pocock has pursued go to a few areas, but many of them focus on the impact on small business. Taking the single-interest stream small business exemption from 15 to 20 employees means that 97½ per cent of Australian businesses are excluded from that stream, if they want to be excluded, but obviously the right to opt in remains there. There'll be a statutory review of the legislation within two years of the bill passing. I note that in two years we'll know whether or not Senator Cash was right and whether Australia has in fact been completely shut down, but we're bravely waiting two years to have the statutory review. There'll be an increase from six months to nine months from the expiry date, where there's a history of effective bargaining, before an employer can be brought into multi-employer bargaining. In the single-interest stream the Fair Work Commission will have to be satisfied that the various employers within there are reasonably comparable. Similarly, there will be an easier way for employers, if they don't want to be part of a multi-employer bargain, if they have fewer than 50 employees, to have that case have to be made by others to the Fair Work Commission, rather than the onus being on them.</span>

We certainly take seriously any allegation like this—and they were very serious allegations that were put forward—because it goes to not just the issue of honesty in an abstract sense; this goes to our reliability as a trade partner, a reliable and trusted exporter of energy, which Australia has the reputation of being, as well as other goods. It is critical that Australia's reputation for being reliable and trusted be maintained in the future, because it is so important for our relations with our major trading partners, including Japan and South Korea, but other nations as well. But it's also important for our economy because the Australian economy receives substantial benefit when we export our resources, and that is one of the facts that goes into paying for our schools and our hospitals and our other services.</span>

I'm pleased also to advise the member for Clark that the Department of Industry, Science and Resources is engaging with the relevant regulators and accreditation bodies to assess the matter. If there's sufficient evidence, relevant authorities should and will investigate. Integrity is the cornerstone of my government.

She is one of the 57 women in the Labor caucus and has a powerful back story that makes me proud and her family proud and should make us all proud.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an important issue, with crucial social and economic implications. The Albanese Labor government is deeply committed to advancing gender equality, and I am proud to be part of a team where 52 per cent of Labor members and senators are women and 10 members of cabinet are women—the most ever. Our reforms through the Fair Work Legislation Amendment (Secure Jobs, Better Pay) Bill will take long overdue steps to address the gender pay gap, get wages moving and support secure work for women as well as safety in the workplace. In 2022, none of these things should be beyond us as a nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill puts women at the heart of the Fair Work system by setting clear expectations that the Fair Work Commission must consider gender equality in performing all of its functions, such as setting the minimum wage, considering changes to awards and other matters. We are establishing a pay equity expert panel and a care and community sector expert panel in the Fair Work Commission, supported by a dedicated research unit. The bill will support improved wages and conditions for early childhood education workers, cleaners, community service workers and others in highly feminised sectors.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will also address the significant hurdles in the Fair Work Act. These hurdles often stand in the way of women in underpaid and undervalued industries obtaining equal remuneration. Our reforms will improve pay transparency and strengthen access to flexible working arrangements so that families can better share and manage their caring responsibilities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Where the previous government refused to act, this bill will prohibit sexual harassment under the Fair Work Act, a recommendation of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Respect</span><span style="font-style:italic;">@</span><span style="font-style:italic;">Work</span> report. I want to pay tribute, as the Prime Minister did earlier today, to the brave actions of the many women who brought this into the light.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These reforms are just one aspect of this government's ambition for Australia to be a leader on gender equality and our commitment to support women's economic equality and safety in the workplace.</span>

                  </a>  The question that the shadow Treasurer asks me, which Dennis Shanahan wrote two or three weeks ago, is based on a completely wrong premise. And it comes as a surprise to nobody on this side of the House that the shadow Treasurer has again got it hopelessly wrong. Let me explain it to the shadow Treasurer. It was not our policy then, and it is not our policy now, to have industry-wide bargaining. There are important differences between the question I was asked last year and our policy now, as outlined by the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, the Prime Minister and others. After industrial relations being such a central part of the political debate in this country for some time, the shadow Treasurer really ought to know the difference between the two concepts. So I say once again for the shadow Treasurer: it is not our policy now to have industry-wide bargaining; it was not our policy to have industry-wide bargaining when David Speers asked me in 2021.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll tell you what is our policy, Mr Speaker. It is our policy to get wages moving again in this country. And that's why I'm so pleased and why I congratulate the industrial relations minister, the Prime Minister, the colleagues in the Senate, Senator Pocock—and I thank him for his support—because for too long in this country wages have been stagnant. One of the reasons why we're on this side of the House and you're on that side of the House is that we take a very different approach to wages than you do. Nothing would make them happier than another decade of wage stagnation like the last decade, Mr Speaker, but we take a different approach. They get sent to this place to diminish and hack at the wages and working conditions of working Australians; we come here to get wages moving again. We're proud to do so, and that's what our policy is all about.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government has, from the time it was elected, been bringing people together to solve some of the very complex issues in our community. The Jobs and Skills Summit was one of those that brought together all sides of the community to look at how we boost economic participation. Over the weekend, the Prime Minister announced the next step in how we bring people together to tackle economic inclusion and how we ensure that the most disadvantaged in our community are supported. Of course, this comes off the back of the agreement we have got with our secure jobs, better pay bill, a piece of legislation that very much will support some of the lowest paid workers in this country.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, we need to also look at those who have been excluded from the workforce. Our commitment to establishing an economic inclusion advisory committee is the next part of ensuring we have a transparent process, run by an expert, legislated committee, to give this government important advice. This committee will be tasked with providing advice to government on economic inclusion, including policy settings, systems and structures, and the adequacy, effectiveness and sustainability of income support payments, ahead of every federal budget.</span>

While we know that there are many competing priorities in the budget and, of course, fiscal pressures that must be handled responsibly, it is the Labor way that in every budget we hand down we consider how we can support those doing it the toughest.</span>

The Treasurer and I will make these appointments with the committee, which is to be established, in an interim capacity to inform the 2023-24 budget before legislating this committee on an ongoing basis. High-level recommendations and findings of the committee will be released publicly at least two weeks prior to each federal budget. </span>

The first reason is in terms of common interest. To claim that a small shop like that has a common interest with a company like Woolworth really beggars belief. And if that's their concept of what a common interest is then they have no understanding of small business on that side. If their view of small business is, 'Oh, it's just the same as Woolies,' then that's a really extraordinary argument. The other concept, if they paid attention over the weekend, is one of the additional amendments that the government has agreed to as to whether or not businesses are reasonably comparable. So, even if you got over the hurdle—and I don't know logically how you could get over the hurdle—on common interest, to claim that they're somehow reasonably comparable would just beggar belief.</span>

Keep going, keep shouting at the moon—that's what they're going to do—but anyone who looks at this with common sense could not reach any of the conclusions that those opposite are trying to draw. </span>

In terms of what will change, it's clear that quite a lot will change because I heard from Senator Cash that these laws are, literally, the most radical changes that this country has seen. The most radical ever is what we're talking about. Two years after the entire nation went into lockdown, apparently people getting their wages moving is the most radical thing the country has ever seen. What will happen? Let me go through what will happen immediately on this legislation passing. Immediately, you will find that job security and gender equality become objectives of the Fair Work Act. That will happen straight away. The sunsetting of zombie agreements will start. We talk about zombie agreements: what are they? There are still people today working under AWAs from the Howard era. There are still people today working under AWAs, and what has happened is that, even though the hourly rate is protected, every penalty rate has disappeared. So there are people now under agreements that would never pass any form of no-disadvantage or better off overall test. They are working on sub-award conditions now. This bill about which those opposite say, 'Everything within it is terrible,' will make sure that people catch up again with what's meant to be the legal rate of pay in Australia. There'll be a ban on job ads which advertise less than the legal minimum rate. Apparently, those opposite think everything in the bill is terrible and that it's okay to advertise for less than the legal minimum rate. In the Senate, as they already have in the House, they'll be voting to keep that rort open.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the moment, if you have a pay equity case, you need to run the case on the basis that you can find a male comparator. So early childhood educators, in trying to argue that their work should be more valued, had to argue that their work was similar to being engineers. It was an impossible hurdle, and they failed. That's part of the reason that we continue to be unable to close the gender pay gap on these various awards. This bill will allow the gender pay gap to be closed, when you no longer have to argue using a male comparator.</span>

Under Labor's industrial relations changes, if a representative for fruit pickers from that farm and the neighbour's farm successfully applies to the Fair Work Commission to bargain a single-interest employer agreement, could all similar fruit growers be forced into multiple-employer bargaining?</span>

I will say two things on the example that's been given. First of all, in terms of the final line, people don't get forced. Either the employer opts in or the workforce vote to be part of an agreement. That's what happens. People don't get compelled in the way that he's just described. Those opposite think the only person at the bargaining table is the employer. That's essentially what's at the heart of this. That's why they can say 'forced'—because they fail to acknowledge the right of the workforce to be able to have a vote as to whether or not they want to be part of something.</span>

                  </a>  I don't blame the farmers for this. I don't blame the horticulturalists themselves, because, principally, they've been paying rates to labour hire firms that they had a right to believe were properly paying people. But what has been happening, the worst examples of people being underpaid that we've seen in Australia, has been in that exact industry. The Leader of the Nationals can scoff at it and say it doesn't matter, but, when people are being paid $4 an hour, it matters. When people are being paid as little as that, it needs to be fixed. When people are being paid absolutely appalling rates of pay, such that they end up fishing out of bins to get food at the back of supermarkets, yes, absolutely, we make sure that we will act on those areas. Those opposite, why don't you have one question at some point that encourages pay rises—just one. There have been plenty of questions on industrial relations but not one that has encouraged rates of pay in this country to go up.</span>

On Friday the first meeting of the Albanese government's investor roundtable was held in Sydney. I was pleased to co-host it along with my friend the Minister for Housing because what it did was bring together leading investors, major banks, global asset managers and super funds to promote stronger investment in priority areas. Friday's focus was affordable housing, and, more particularly, the housing accord that we announced on budget night, which is all about bringing together investors, state governments, local governments—like that led so ably by my friend Matt Burnett, the mayor of Gladstone, up there in the gallery—the building industry and others.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those in the room on Friday represented trillions of dollars of funds under management, all there to see how we can work together to address one of our nation's biggest challenges. I want to thank everyone who was there in the room: the CEOs of the major banks; the heads of Australia's leading retail and industry super funds; major institutional investors; the Future Fund; leaders in the property sector and community housing; and the ACT Chief Minister Andrew Barr, who was representing the state and territory treasurers. We worked through some of the barriers to large-scale investment in affordable housing, and we talked about financing solutions to encourage greater investment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At a time when we've got low vacancy rates and high rents, we need to do what we can to bring people together around the table to solve some of our big economic challenges. I'm really pleased that there have already been concrete outcomes out of the first roundtable. Just yesterday, the National Australia Bank announced that they've set a new target: to lend an additional $6 billion over the next six years to build more affordable homes across the country. That will be loaned to social and community housing providers, disability accommodation projects, build-to-rent projects and some of the government's housing programs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The CEO of NAB, Ross McEwen, said that he welcomed the opportunity to contribute to the discussion at the Treasurer's Investor Roundtable. We welcome this really important contribution from NAB as well as from other players: Aware Super, AXA, Australian Retirement Trust, HESTA, Cbus and others.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a terrific start, but it's just the start of our work to get more investment into affordable, well located housing so that people can live closer to where the jobs and opportunities are being created. It's just the start of our work to help make sure that we can harness trillions of dollars of Australian capital to deliver wins for investors, super fund members and the nation.</span>

Even though the climate crisis is the biggest threat to our environment, the Minister for Resources said last week that the decision on the future of coal and gas should be made by overseas boardrooms, not by Australia. Do you agree, or in next week's response to the review of our environment laws will you announce a climate trigger so that the impact of climate pollution has to be taken into account when considering new coal and gas mines?</span>

It goes to two issues. The first is the government's response to the Samuel review, which was looking at the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. Like many things those opposite did, they received the Samuel review about two years ago and never really responded to it. So, of course, we will respond to the Samuel review. The Samuel review found two things. The first is that environmental laws have presided over a worsening of our environment. We saw that with the <span style="font-style:italic;">S</span><span style="font-style:italic;">tate of the </span><span style="font-style:italic;">e</span><span style="font-style:italic;">nvironment</span> report that those opposite also kept secret, and it found that approvals processes were slow and cumbersome. We want to do two things. We want to give better environmental protections and faster, clearer decision-making, and our response will go to that.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the issue of coal and gas projects, what we have consistently said on this side is that they will be assessed on a case-by-case basis. They'll have to meet our environmental laws. They'll have to stack up environmentally and economically. That position hasn't changed.</span>

This week is set to be a historic week for this parliament. Australians are expecting this parliament to deliver the National Anti-Corruption Commission that they endorsed at the election. The passage of the two National Anti-Corruption Commission bills that are currently before the Senate will show that this parliament has listened and acted. The government's model for a national anticorruption commission contained in these bills is a strong watchdog with teeth. This body will have the powers of a standing royal commission. It will be able to commence investigations in its own right and accept anonymous tip-offs. It will have the ability to hold public hearings in exceptional circumstances and where it is in the public interest to do so. Importantly, the National Anti-Corruption Commission will have the necessary powers to root out corruption when it occurs. Just by doing its job it will have a strong deterrent effect on those who may engage in corrupt activity.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is in stark contrast to the model that was promised but never delivered by the Liberal and National parties. Their proposed body did not allow for public hearings at all. It could not receive anonymous tip-offs or initiate its own inquiries, and it could only investigate matters that reached a criminal threshold. In short, it was a model that was designed not to tackle corruption at all. The Liberal and National parties' model was described by integrity experts as, 'The weakest watchdog in the country that would hide corruption and not expose it.' But the Australian people didn't buy it. They knew that those opposite would never—</span>

The Australian people didn't buy the model that the Liberal and National parties had. They knew that those opposite would never a deliver a watchdog with teeth. But we will. We will do it this week. This government stands ready to deliver, and I call on the whole parliament to join us in that task.</span>

One of the Albanese government's greatest challenges is securing Australia's future submarine capability. There is no military platform that gives rise to a greater question mark in any adversary's mind than a highly capable submarine, which is why submarines matter, in terms of building Australia's strategic space for diplomacy and for trade. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no worse example of the lost decade that Australia has had, under the former coalition government, than the sheer negligence that they showed in the handling of future submarines, and the rot started very early. Former defence minister Johnston declared that he had no confidence that Australia could build a submarine. Indeed, he famously declared that he wouldn't trust the Australian defence industry to build a canoe. Prime Minister Abbott and defence minister Andrews sought to have our future submarines built by Japan as a bargaining chip to close the free-trade agreement with Japan. Talk about the tail wagging the dog! And in early 2015, the country was treated to the spectacle of Australia's future submarines being tossed around the former government's party room during the empty chair challenge on Tony Abbott. There is no moment where those opposite have shown greater contempt for Australia's defence or the Australian people than this. </span>

                  </a>  Then, in 2016, we saw those opposite prematurely down select the bidders for the future submarine to one, without competing on the design of the submarine—a decision which involved billions of dollars—so that they could have a slightly more convincing press conference on the eve of the 2016 election. What is consistent with all of this is that the Liberals love the politics of defence but have zero interest in defence policy. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the Albanese government things are very different, because we're not concerned about politics; we're only interested and focused on the national interest. There is a power of work underway, right now, with our partners in the United Kingdom and the United States about what will be the optimal pathway for Australia's future, nuclear powered submarine. We're on track to be able to make that announcement in the first part of next year, and building a nuclear submarine in this country will be one of Australia's great national endeavours. It will transform our strategic posture, it will build our sovereignty and it will empower Australia as a nation. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are currently negotiating with the European Union about a free trade agreement. As part of that, I met with the new Italian Prime Minister when we were together at the G20 meeting. It was the first meeting between an Australian Prime Minister and the Italian Prime Minister for some period of time, and, at that bilateral meeting, I put forward Australia's interest in advancing the free trade agreement. We know, in terms of the agricultural sector in particular, that nations such as France and Italy have been very protective of particular labels of products. But the truth is that prosecco is a product which is produced not just in Italy, just like how roses are grown in lots of places around the world and they're still roses. We will advance Australia's national interest and negotiate in good faith with the European Union, and I'm hopeful that the European Commission will send their leaders—Ursula and Charles—out here next year. I've invited them to come out and meet with business, including in the agricultural sector, next year.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is much to be gained by a free trade agreement with Europe. When we think about the issues that have been raised with free trade agreements, they often relate to labour laws and relative cost. When you're talking about Europe, you don't have those issues. You can have a win-win agreement. That is why the entry fee for negotiating with Europe was a decent climate change policy, and that was indicated very clearly by the European Commission—not just the Italian Prime Minister but also the Spanish Prime Minister, the French President and the German Chancellor.</span>

We understand that these are challenges and that the starting position of our friends in Europe is different from ours, but we'll negotiate in good faith, and we'll consult with industries, including with the agricultural sector, as we do it.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Suburban Rail Loop will be truly transformational to the state of Victoria. The first section—Suburban Rail Loop East—is a project that delivers twin tunnels with six underground stations at Cheltenham, Clayton, Monash, Burwood, Glen Waverley and Box Hill. It's due to open in 2035, and it will open up access to key education, health and employment centres in Melbourne's east and south-east. The benefit will also go people in the Latrobe Valley and Gippsland, who will be able to access Monash University, the newly opened Victorian Heart Hospital and Monash Children's Hospital, all without needing to head into the centre of Melbourne, saving them an hour on public transport for that trip.

Early works are already underway right now in Clayton, and they'll begin in Glen Waverley early in the new year. Preparatory works are also about to kick off at Burwood and Monash and Box Hill, ahead of construction of the new Box Hill Suburban Rail Loop station. The Albanese government has committed $2.2 billion to the early works of Suburban Rail Loop East. The detailed business and investment case of the loop, released by Victoria last year, demonstrated the benefit-cost ratio of up to 1.7, meaning $1.70 would be returned for every $1 invested. This is a completely transformational project for the state of Victoria. It's a project that has the support of our government, and it's pretty clear from Saturday that it has the overwhelming support of the Victorian community as well.</span>

It is unusual to receive a question from the shadow minister given the personal experience that he's had not just in service but in respect of this. I want to say up front that I very much acknowledge his service in Australia's Defence Force. But it's more than that—and he knows my feelings about this: the member opposite, in respect of this issue, is a very brave man. Australia owes him a debt of gratitude for what he has done on this.</span>

But what we can take encouragement from is that the Brereton inquiry, to the credit of the former government, is Australia dealing with its own issues. It goes to who we are as a people, and it is a fundamentally important report and one which needs to be treated with the upmost respect. I very much know that the honourable member knows that better than anyone in this place.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gorton</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Skills and Training</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:59</span>):  I thank the member for Swan for her question and her interest in the VET sector in her electorate and beyond in her great state of Western Australia. Can I say, as members know, that when we were elected we inherited not only a trillion dollars in public debt; we inherited a massive skills deficit across the economy. For that reason the Prime Minister called a Jobs and Skills Summit. From that summit we had an announcement of 180,000 fee-free TAFE and VET places, which is providing certainty for the VET sector to provide the courses that students and existing workers need to fill the skills gaps in sectors and occupations across the economy. Of course, the National Skills Commission's last report—and this does explain, I think, the scale and breadth of the problem—showed that there'd been almost a doubling of occupations on the shortage list in 12 months, from 153 to 286 occupations, which really does explain how important it is for us to get this right. The other metric that I think is important and relevant to the House is to look at the completed trade apprenticeships. In 2012 it was 57,000. In 2021, 20,000 fewer completed trade apprenticeships in the VET sector, which really means that we need reform in the VET sector, as well as supplying the investment to provide the courses for the skills that are needed in our economy.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm very happy to announce today the Minister for Education and Training, Minister Ellery, and I signed an agreement between the Commonwealth and Western Australia for that great state. It now has an extra 18,800 places in areas of shortage. That's right; we've got thousands more in aged care, agriculture, construction, hospitality, tourism and all those areas in the economy that are crying out for skills—a very important announcement by the Commonwealth and Western Australia. It really does speak to the need for us to work very closely with state and territory governments. When we came to office there was no national skills agreement in place between the previous government and any state or territory government. Not one government had signed up to a national skills agreement. We're getting on with the job. This is the third jurisdiction that has signed up. Many more agreements will be made prior to the end of this year. We are getting on with the job of supplying the skills in the labour market to employers that are desperate for those skills in this economy, and we'll keep doing that until we get it right. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

As I understand it, he's asking if there are any secret elements of any arrangements that were put forward as part of an agreement to pass our industrial relations legislation. Let me get this right: the political party that has a secret agreement as the basis of its forming of government, between the Liberal Party and the National Party, is asking, 'Are there any elements that are unknown?' They didn't even know who their ministers were. They had two Treasurers, two finance ministers, two health ministers, two industry, science et cetera ministers, and no-one was allowed to know—and they come in here and give a newbie a question like that? What a joke.</span>

He has been very upfront, as have I. That compares with the opposition, who, when it became known that we weren't aware of how many of these secret ministries were in existence, had a debate in their shadow cabinet and, according to one frontbencher, said, 'The view was we were best not to talk about it.' That's according to Niki Savva. That's not something in the past; that's about the way that they're operating now. When they were embarrassed when the Australian public found out how many treasurers and how many finance ministers there were, what they said was, 'We're best not to talk about it.' </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Burt</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Veterans' Affairs and Minister for Defence Personnel</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:07</span>):  I thank the member for Adelaide for his question and his advocacy for the considerable veteran community in his seat of Adelaide. As I know that he knows, the Royal Commission into Defence and Veteran Suicide handed down its interim report in August. In the interests of transparency, we made that report public the same day. In September I was proud to deliver the Albanese government's formal response to the report, responding to each of the 13 recommendations from the royal commission. The government agrees with the royal commission that urgent and immediate action is required. One of the key recommendations of the royal commission is to remove the average staffing level cap at the Department of Veterans' Affairs. As a Labor government, we know the importance of secure work. That staffing cap has already been removed. Many of the recommendations go to eliminating the claims backlog at DVA. At the election, Labor committed to employing 500 additional staff for DVA, and I'm proud that more than 200 of those staff have now been employed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The first Albanese Labor government budget also responded to these recommendations. In implementing the government's response to the royal commission, $233.9 million was put forward for engaging these additional staff. Also $87 million was allocated to modernise IT systems in DVA to improve claims processing. There was $24.3 million allocated to providing increased support to veterans who are having their claims processed and to improving modelling capabilities to manage the demand on DVA services. We've also committed $15.5 million to support DVA's continued engagement with the royal commission. The Albanese government also committed $9.5 million to developing a pathway for the simplification and harmonisation of veteran compensation and rehabilitation legislation. Work is currently underway on developing that pathway, which we will outline in the new year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The royal commission interim report also goes to improving Defence and DVA's release of information to the loved ones of deceased family members. The Department of Defence and DVA are working with an independent consultant to work with ADF members, veterans, families and representative cohorts to co-design a trauma informed implementation of these recommendations. Work on these recommendations is on track for completion by March 2023. After years of reports, too many deaths, too many lives changed for the worse and endless discussion, we're actually getting on with the job. Our government is committed to the task of saving lives and ensuring a better future for our defence and veteran communities.</span>

At the COP27 last week, every country in the world, every COP party, came together for this agreement. According to the Leader of the Opposition, he would have stood away with his arms folded and said, 'We're not in; we're not having this conversation.' On this side of the House, we believe that actually interacting with Pacific countries in particular about the impact of climate change on them is central to our agenda. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There have been some mistruths told by those opposite. Let's just run through them. They talk about China. Let's just call it for what it is. In fact, the agreement reflected in the cover text of the COP meeting says that this arrangement will be for the 'particularly vulnerable' countries. China is not one of those. Every country is vulnerable to climate change, but the most vulnerable are Kiribati, Vanuatu and Fiji. They are the countries that we deal with, and we are proud to deal with. The Leader of the Opposition thinks that the impacts of climate change on Pacific islands are just part of his comedy routine. It's not a very good comedy routine, but it's all he's got.</span>

I'm proud of the work we did together in Egypt, working with the prime ministers and climate change ministers of the Pacific. I'm proud of that. I don't run away from that. On this side of the House, we're proud of that too. Those opposite can take a different approach if they wish. They can hold the Pacific islands off to one side and say, 'Talk to the hand; we're not interested.' </span>

The Bell inquiry confirmed that the principles of responsible government were 'fundamentally undermined' because the former Prime Minister was not responsible to the parliament or the public. The inquiry described how this bizarre behaviour has had 'a corrosive impact on public trust and confidence in government'. The report states that the public didn't know 'something it was entitled to know'. My government will implement all six recommendations, and, later this week, we will introduce legislation to this House to make sure this can never happen again. I've already instructed the Secretary of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet to ensure that there is proper transparency should any appointments be made.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The actions of the former Prime Minister were extraordinary. They were unprecedented and they were wrong. They exposed a cult of secrecy and a culture of cover-up, which arrogantly dismissed scrutiny as an inconvenience. Members of the former government and the current opposition enabled this culture; they sat back with a cabinet committee of one and said that that was acceptable. The Leader of the Opposition has made excuses for this behaviour. He just doesn't get it.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Niki Savva's upcoming book reports the decision by the shadow cabinet: according to one frontbencher, the view was that it was best not to talk about it. Today, the Manager of Opposition Business has said that they won't vote for a censure motion on the basis that, according to him, the issue of the relationship between the former PM and his ministers is a matter for them.</span>

                  </a>  They still don't get it. It's not about you; it's about the Australian people and whether they have a right to know who the ministers are. It is about the Westminster system of our parliamentary democracy and whether it has been undermined. They just don't get it, but we'll give them the opportunity to have a say on that, and they will be held to account for it.</span>

They should never be called conservatives, because conservatives support institutions; those opposite undermine them at every single opportunity.

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Riverina</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:19</span>):  Recently the member for Tangney and I were asked to oversee the Vanuatu election process, which took place on 13 October. It was a short, sharp 10-day campaign followed by a snap election being called. Vanuatu has a 52-seat parliament serving a population of 300,000. Australia stood tall in these elections to help that process. I know the member for Tangney and I were very proud of Australia's involvement. Indeed, the Vanuatu Election Commission, normally staffed by just eight full-time officers, was assisted by contract staff as well as technical support offered by both Australia and New Zealand. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A major logistical operation was put in train, to support more ballot papers, overland by vehicle and small boats to coastal villages. I want to point out to the chamber the role that the Royal Australian Air Force played using C-27J Spartan. On many of those airstrips, which were barely wide enough to take the landing of such heavy aircraft, those pilots landed brilliantly, to make sure that the ballot papers were delivered to very remote islands. You had to see it to believe it. 'It is a bit difficult in Vanuatu,' the electorate office chairman Edward Kaltamat said. He added, 'We have many islands and not many roads.' I can tell you, Mr Speaker, and the member for Tangney would back me up here, many of those roads are simply impassable. They are unusable. But they got the ballot papers out. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a new parliament. Vanuatu's new Prime Minister, Alatoi Ishmael Kalsakau, said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I want to thank the government of Australia, who assisted us with swift support and facilitated smooth transportation of ballot boxes to remote places in Vanuatu,</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed, we also collected those ballot boxes. Gloria Julia King became the first woman to enter the country's parliament in 14 years. We should honour that, we should exalt it and we should absolutely be promoting it to other Pacific nations, for them to do the same. The Pacific has the lowest rate of female representation in parliament anywhere in the world, according to World Vision, but Ms King is going to lead the way, and we praise her for that. The Vanuatu Election Commission listed the names of 219 people contesting the recent election, with only eight females. So well done to Ms King for being elected. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the day, I went to polling stations right across Tanna Island, also known as Mount Yasur volcano island. I commend the member for Tangney for his bipartisanship. I commend him for the role that he played in this. I also want to especially thank First Secretary, Development, Kirsty Dudgeon, the High Commissioner to Vanuatu, Heidi Bootle, and the member for Tangney for his role and participation in making sure that the election was as democratic as it could be. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tangney</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:22</span>):  Thank you, member for Riverina, for your kind words. It was a privilege to be a political scrutineer for a federal election of Vanuatu, which took place on 13 November 2022. I want to thank Minister Wong for inviting me to participate in this important democratic process. In my few short days in Vanuatu I learned much. The people of Vanuatu are so kind. They do not have much, but they are genuine. They do not have many possessions, but they are grateful. I saw many people with no shoes but with big smiles on their faces. I was touched and humbled by their spirits. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A memory that will stay with me is the process to deliver the ballot box. Ballot boxes were delivered by police officers, from the police station, delivering the ballot box on foot. This involved walking for days, crossing rivers and streams, to get to remote communities so that people living in these communities could have their say. After votes were placed, the police officers had to carry the lot back to where they started their journey from. This goes to show how much work the democratic process can take in developing countries. We should never take this for granted in Australia. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The people of Vanuatu have a great deal of respect for Australians. There is a strong bond between our two countries. It is like a brother-sister relationship. Australia is proud to be Vanuatu's largest development, humanitarian and security partner. The people of Vanuatu recognise the support the Australian government provides to them. Our partnership is going from strength to strength. The ties within our Pacific family will continue to deepen. The Australian government will continue to offer support and assistance to our brothers and sisters in Vanuatu. Our region faces challenges, but we will face them together beside one another. I thank the people of Vanuatu for giving me such a warm welcome. I went to Vanuatu to work, but I came back with many friends.</span>

                    </a>  by leave—On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works and the co-chair, the member for Hinkler, I present the committee's fifth report for 2022. This report considers three proposals referred to the committee in September this year, with a combined value of over $549 million. Two of the three proposals are from the Department of Defence, for redevelopments at Robertson Barracks in Darwin and HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Harman</span> in the ACT. The third proposal is for a fit-out of the ABC offices in Parramatta and Ultimo, New South Wales.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The proposed works at Robertson Barracks in the Northern Territory will upgrade and expand the facilities and allow for future expansion, at a proposed code of $389 million. Robertson Barracks supports approximately 5,000 personnel, including an annual six-month rotation of about 2,000 US Marines. The scope of proposed works includes upgrades to the living and accommodation, messing facilities and water and electrical services.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second project is for redevelopment at HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Harman</span>, which is a navy base located in the Australian Capital Territory. <span style="font-style:italic;">Harman</span> is used as a communications and operational facility as well as providing all the administrative support for Navy personnel in the Canberra region. The redevelopment is needed to replace ageing facilities. The project covers improvements to the engineering, infrastructure and office accommodation. It will also give additional security to the base entry and refurbish the living and accommodation. The project will also provide a much-needed new gymnasium. The total proposed cost for the redevelopment is $116 million.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The third proposed work is smaller, with a proposed cost of $44 million, for a fit-out of the ABC offices in its Parramatta and Ultimo offices in Sydney. The ABC is seeking to expand the ABCs presence in Parramatta to reflect Parramatta's status as one of Australia's fastest growing areas and home to 2.6 million Australians. At the same time, the ABC will refurbish the Ultimo offices, which are owned by the ABC, and lease out some of the unused space. Both fit-outs will reflect an increased move to flexible working arrangements for ABC staff.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Public Works Committee would also like to extend its thanks to all those who provided written and oral evidence in support of these inquiries. We would also like to thank the personnel of both the Department of Defence and the ABC for their presentations on these projects. The committee was able to travel to inspect the proposed works at both Robertson Barracks and HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Harman</span>. These were valuable visits with comprehensive briefings from defence staff. For all three projects the committee recommends that it is expedient that proposed works be carried out. I commend the report to the House.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr BURNS:</span>
                    </a>  by leave—I'm pleased to present the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights <span style="font-style:italic;">Human rights scrutiny report</span>: <span style="font-style:italic;">report 6 of 2022</span>, which was tabled in the Senate on Friday 25 November. In this report, the committee has considered 23 new bills, one previously deferred bill and 188 new legislative instruments. The committee has commented on eight of these bills and one legislative instrument. The committee has also commented on a response it received from the Attorney-General in relation to the National Anti-Corruption Commission bills.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In its last scrutiny report, the committee made a series of recommendations to improve the human rights capability of this bill, and I'm very pleased to advise that the majority of these recommendations have been agreed to by the Attorney-General. In particular, the Attorney-General agreed to the committee's recommendation to modify the proposed non-disclosure notation power, to ensure that a person needing additional professional support to comply with a notice to produce or a summons can obtain this. This helps better protect the rights of persons with a disability. The Attorney-General also agreed to further strengthen journalistic safeguards in the case of search warrants (which better protects the right to free speech), and to remove a contempt provision for creating a disturbance near a commission hearing (which better protects the right to protest). I thank the Attorney-General for his careful consideration of the committee's advice. This is a clear example of how the human rights committee's analysis of legislation can ensure better protection of fundamental human rights in Commonwealth legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In this report the committee also considered the Fair Work Legislation Amendment (Secure Jobs, Better Pay) Bill 2022. The majority of the committee considered this bill would promote human rights, including the rights to work, just and favourable conditions of work, and equality and nondiscrimination. However, in relation to the prohibition on industrial action relating to cooperative workplace agreements and mandatory conciliation or mediation before industrial action is protected, the committee has drawn to the parliament's attention the restrictions on the right to strike, and recommends that the statement of compatibility be updated.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition, the committee provides its advice to the parliament as to the human rights compatibility of the Crimes Amendment (Penalty Unit) Bill 2022. This bill seeks to increase by 24 per cent the maximum available penalty for every Commonwealth criminal and civil penalty provision expressed in terms of penalty units across the Commonwealth statute book. In relation to civil penalties, the committee considers that this increase may mean some of these penalties engage criminal process rights, because civil penalties may be considered criminal in nature under international human rights law in certain circumstances, including based on how severe the penalty is.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, the committee has considered the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Information Disclosure, National Interest and Other Measures) Bill 2022. This bill would permit the disclosure of personal information to facilitate assistance provided by the telecommunications industry to law enforcement agencies and emergency services organisations. While the bill seeks to achieve the legitimate objective of protecting life and health, it also limits the right to privacy and further information is required to determine precisely how these measures would operate in practice. The committee is therefore seeking further information in relation to this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With these comments, I commend the committee's scrutiny report No. 6 of 2022 to the House. I wish all staff and the secretariat a very merry Christmas and offer them a very big thank you. They have done an extremely good job this year with the huge amount of work advising the committee. They are some of the very best public servants we have. I also thank committee members for the collaborative way in which they have gone about the important work of the human rights committee this year.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr COLEMAN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Banks</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:32</span>):  by leave—I rise to speak on report No. 6 of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights and specifically on the dissenting report that relates to the Fair Work Legislation Amendment (Secure Jobs, Better Pay) Bill 2022. The majority report takes at face value the government's assertions about the impact of the bill, particularly its impact on human rights. This in a sense highlights some of the limitations of the human rights law analysis process, because it is inherently subjective. The analysis of this particular bill is highly subjective. There are three points I want to make about that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">First, as advised to the committee back in 2015, under human rights law there is a right to an adequate standard of living. Nations are not meant to unjustifiably take any backward steps that might affect living standards. As you can see, what might have a negative effect on living standards is quite subjective. The government says obviously that this bill will have a positive effect on living standards; we say it will have a negative effect on living standards. It's not something that a human rights committee can definitively determine one way or the other, because it's inherently subjective.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In our view the bill will result in declining living standards, due to the impact of multi-employer bargaining. The likely increase in industrial action as a consequence of this bill will lead to loss of productivity in the economy and reduced investments by business, which in turn will put downward pressure on employment and wages growth, directly having a negative impact on the standard of living.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Similarly, the committee was advised in 2015 that, under human rights law, nations shouldn't take steps which will unjustifiably take any backward steps that might affect the right to work. Our view is that this bill will have just that effect because it's plain that the legislation will lead to increased industrial action that will flow into reduced economic activity and, consequently, employment, meaning that there will be less employment as a consequence of this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, under human rights law, legislation is not meant to discriminate on the basis of geography. This law contains a particular provision where businesses can be brought into the operation of this law based on their location under the common interest test. That means that two small businesses in different parts of Australia will be treated quite differently depending purely on where they're located, which is inconsistent with international human rights law. There are at least three aspects of this bill which are, in fact, negative from a human rights law perspective. That is different to the majority opinion report, and that is why we provide this dissenting report.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr WOOD</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">La Trobe</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:36</span>):  I rise to speak on the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Information Disclosure, National Interest and Other Measures) Bill 2022. This bill is all about saving lives and finding people in need who could potentially be putting themselves in harm's way or who, through other means, could have been put in harm's way. Each year there are 53,000 people who are reported missing. The great news is most of those people turn up safely within the first 24 hours. Sadly, there are times when they don't, and law enforcement and family members are trying to find them. I go back to my time in the police force many years ago, when someone would come to the counter and report a missing person. In those days we didn't have the luxury of mobile phones or the technology we're talking about today when it comes to triangulation. You'd basically say to the people, 'Let's see how they go in the first 24 hours,' and you'd go and speak to friends and relatives and everything else like that. But what would make a difference is when the person said, 'We found a suicide note,' or, 'The person has been suicidal in the past.' We had no option in that time apart from putting the car registration over the police radio so people could keep a look out for that person.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another example and a tragic reminder is Jill Meagher, a person who was murdered on Friday 22 September, 2012. Jill, as you might recall, was a person who worked for the ABC. The murderer was a person by the name of Adrian Bayley. The body was discovered six days later near Gisborne South. At that time, I was back in the Victorian Police in the crime department, and the homicide squad did the most amazing work when they looked at everyone who was using mobile phones and followed those people who went out of the CBD, to track them. The way it works is every mobile phone pings through a mobile phone tower. They were able to use this when they realised Adrian Bayley was a suspect, using the triangulation to work out where he'd driven down towards Gisborne South.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation will make great inroads into helping our emergency services workers to track down a person. That's why the coalition rolled out the advanced mobile location—or AML—technology, built into the operating systems of Apple and Android telephones to provide greater location accuracy to triple 0 services during an emergency call from a mobile phone.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Telecommunications Act includes general prohibitions on carriers and carriage service providers disclosing certain information and documents, including telecommunications data. There are some important exemptions, including where disclosure of this information is reasonably necessary to prevent or lessen a serious and imminent threat to life or person.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The great news about this legislation is that it removes the word 'imminent'. You can imagine someone going into a police station or contacting triple 000 and finding that the only way law enforcement can get information is by proving there's an imminent threat to that person's safety. That's now been removed, so the decision can be based on the circumstances—for instance, 'We now have a missing person.' I assume the way it would work in police circles is that they would make an application to an inspector or above in the police force—this is my assumption from the way other acts work in the police force—they'd get the authority, and the telecommunications company would provide the information to be used to track that person down. For example, someone worried about another person's safety or a risk of them causing harm to themselves could establish that person's whereabouts in a certain location and notify the local police, who could look out for a certain vehicle or registration number in the hope of finding that person before something bad happened. Another situation might be a person out in the bush, bushwalking or going somewhere, and their family not knowing where they are. Again, they could use that information.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill clarifies that carriage service providers and carriage service intermediaries will not be liable for damages when such entities are acting in good faith in providing assistance as is reasonably necessary to emergency service organisations. So there are safeguards in the bill. It makes sure that we don't get a situation in which the service provider doesn't provide the information to police. It also makes some technical amendments, including clarification of the definition of 'telecommunications transmission tower'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I should note that the opposition is concerned that one of the stated intentions of the bill, which is that the telecommunications companies would rely on law enforcement and emergency service organisations to determine whether the threat to life or health was serious, is not reflected in the way the bill is drafted. That's something the opposition would like to have clarified.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill responds to several recommendations, including from the Australian Law Reform Commission and a state coroner, about the current drafting of the act, which requires that a threat to life or health be imminent. This has hindered the disclosure of information about the location of a missing person, which could be determined by mobile phone triangulation. In cases where a person has been abducted, this would be vital information to make available to law enforcement agencies. When it comes to an investigation that is trying to locate a person, time is of the essence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In October 2022, a New South Wales deputy state coroner wrote to the Minister for Communications recommending amendments to the act following the inquest into the disappearance of a Sydney person. The inquest heard evidence from police that the 'imminent' qualifier was a barrier to progressing a triangulation request. In her second reading speech on the bill, the minister also made reference to a 2020 New South Wales coronial inquest which found that accessing telecommunications data to locate a missing person presented an unrealistic barrier. However, in a departmental briefing with the shadow minister it was confirmed that the government had not received a written request for amendments to the act prior to 2022.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Could I now talk about the coalition's record when in government. The coalition's rollout of AML technology built into the operating systems of Apple and Android telephones was completed in 2021. AML has provided greater location accuracy to triple 0 during emergency calls from a mobile phone, with the objective of saving lives and improving outcomes for mobile users across Australia. The coalition also funded 1,200 mobile base stations, delivered record investment to support regional connectivity, and improved telecommunications infrastructure for disaster resilience. It rolled out 99 per cent of the NBN; established the world's first e-safety commissioner through the Online Safety Act, which extended important online safety protections to adults; and passed new regulations to combat telephone scams.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Overall, this is a great piece of legislation. It will be used by law enforcement agencies to make their job of finding missing people easier.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Riverina</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:44</span>):  Just very briefly on that, and in response to the previous member: I fully concur and agree. You cannot place enough importance on the fact that mobile phone technology can be used to find missing persons—indeed, to find those people who may have been murdered and whose bodies may be buried in shallow graves somewhere in the regions. I can recall one such case: that of Stephanie Scott, a school teacher at Leeton High School, who was taken—abducted—and murdered. As to the perpetrator of this crime, the fact that we had mobile phone towers in the vicinity that were able to track the person's mobile phone meant we were able not only to identify that that person was involved but also, indeed, to find the body of Ms Scott. This was such a family tragedy, I can remember, for the entire Leeton community. Paul Mayton, the mayor at the time, led brilliantly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But this mobile phone technology is so, so important. I commend the minister opposite for what she has done thus far, in visiting the Riverina electorate and the Central West.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know we had a good record with rolling out mobile phone towers and installing 900 towers and funding more than 1,300 of them. But I would like to see the government continue this.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="159771" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms ROWLAND</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Greenway</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Communications</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:46</span>):  I thank those members who have contributed to the debate on the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Information Disclosure, National Interest and Other Measures) Bill 2022. This bill amends a range of telecommunications legislation. Among other crucial functions, these amendments are intended to help save lives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In response to recommendations from two coronial inquests, the bill supports telecommunications companies to better protect the safety and wellbeing of Australians in danger. Specifically, the bill removes the requirement that a serious threat to a person's life or health also be imminent before telcos are able to help law enforcement. Without this amendment, we risk the lives and safety of more Australians as a result of this, at times, unrealistic, standard.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There has been some valuable discussion around the privacy aspects of the bill. I want to make it clear: this bill increases privacy safeguards while improving the existing mechanism to help emergency services save lives. Disclosures will now only be permitted in cases where it is unreasonable or impracticable to obtain the consent of the person the disclosure relates to. Limiting disclosure to cases where it is unreasonable or impracticable to obtain consent provides an additional safeguard for the right to privacy, in cases where a person is reported to police as missing but wishes not to be contacted or found. This directly contemplates circumstances of family violence.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Furthermore, the bill also proposes a consequential amendment to the Telecommunications Act to curtail any secondary disclosures of information, unless it is also connected to preventing a serious threat to the person's life. As such, police agencies will not be permitted to disclose information about a person's whereabouts or contact information to third parties, such as family members, unless it is with the consent of the person involved—for example, once the person is found. My department understands that this is consistent with existing practice in missing persons cases. Police agencies do not disclose information about a person's whereabouts to third parties.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There is an important role for police and emergency service organisations in building the case that the threat to life or health is serious and that the consent of the person cannot reasonably or practicably be obtained. It is important to note that, as the explanatory memorandum makes clear, telecommunications companies would be relying on the representations of police and emergency service organisations in forming a view on whether a threat were serious, rather than on representations made by members of the public who claim to have some connection with the missing person.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important not to lose sight of the purpose of this bill. The bill seeks to carefully balance the right to privacy against the need to help police and emergency service organisations to find people where there is a reasonable belief of a serious threat to their life. The bill also further enhances public safety by making clear that unlisted telephone numbers can be disclosed to the triple 0 emergency call person, where it is unreasonable to obtain the person's consent. This will enable emergency services to do what is necessary to save lives.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also corrects an error from the National Emergency Declaration Act 2020, such that telecommunications companies are granted protections from liability for damages when acting in good faith during national emergencies. This amendment extends longstanding provisions in the Telecommunications Act regarding reasonable and necessary assistance in the national interest. The bill also enhances transparency and accountability in the handling of personal data by improving record-keeping requirements to include more details about the authorisation of information disclosures.</span>

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">That this bill be now read a second time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian government is committed to protecting the integrity of the Medicare program. Rigorous and effective health-provider compliance is a vital component of this commitment. The behaviour of individual practitioners remains a critical focus, but the government is adapting its compliance arrangements for corporations in recognition that they are increasingly involved in and influencing the provision of healthcare services.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill both strengthens and adds flexibility to compliance powers, especially the ability of the Professional Services Review to address the inappropriate practice of corporations. In essence, the bill extends provisions that are currently applicable only to individual practitioners to corporations and other nonpractitioners. The new provisions allow the director to come to an agreement with a body corporate or nonpractitioner as an alternative to a lengthy review by a committee. This is a valuable and practical addition to the PSR's toolkit, facilitating confidential agreements with corporations while still ensuring that the PSR properly addresses inappropriate practice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It must be emphasised, however, that, while the bill strengthens compliance arrangements in respect of corporations, it also protects practitioners employed or otherwise engaged by corporations that acknowledge inappropriate practice. To be clear, individual practitioners will not be named in agreements with corporations. To encourage compliance, the director of the PSR will have discretion whether or not to publish details of the agreement when its terms are not fulfilled.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's commitment to improved compliance is demonstrated through new sanctions, including civil penalties, to discourage behaviour that interferes with the ability of the PSR to review inappropriate practice and the Commonwealth's ability to recover debts formed in agreement between persons under review and the director. In addition, the director will be able to apply for court orders that require non-responsive corporations to comply with notices to produce information.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another important safeguard protecting the compliance terms negotiated in agreements is the extension of the government's ability to garnishee the bank accounts of persons and corporations that renege on agreements to repay a debt to the Commonwealth.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also clarifies that a referral to the PSR may be made where it appears there is the possibility that a person may have engaged in inappropriate practice in the provision of services. It is ultimately for the director or a committee to investigate whether or not a person has provided services and to determine whether the conduct of the person under review in relation to the rendering or initiation of services amounts to inappropriate practice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also addresses inconsistencies arising from the introduction of legislation in 2018 to improve debt recovery powers under the Health Insurance Act 1973, the National Health Act 1953 and the Dental Benefits Act 2008. The bill introduces amendments clarifying the application of debt recovery provisions, the use of financial information powers, the recovery of Commonwealth debts from estates, the recovery of interest on Commonwealth debt and the administrative penalties for debt under the Shared Debt Recovery Scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, the bill amends the National Health Act 1953 and the Dental Benefits Act 2008 to mirror recent changes to the Health Insurance Act 1973. The December 2020 amendments to the Health Insurance Act 1973 clarified that the Commonwealth may recover incorrect payments resulting from the giving of false or misleading information. I thank the members for their contributions to the debate on this bill.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="219646" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr McCORMACK</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Riverina</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:56</span>):  I rise to speak on the Health Legislation Amendment (Medicare Compliance and Other Measures) Bill 2022. This bill amends the Health Insurance Act 1973, the National Health Act 1953 and the Dental Benefits Act 2008. In broad terms, the bill aims to protect the viability and ongoing integrity of Medicare, including the Medicare Benefits Schedule and Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to place on record that Australia has a world-class health system. If you travel anywhere in the world, you can see how good our health system is. It is first class. Can it be better? Of course, it can always be better. Can it be improved? Yes, indeed. But we should be very proud of the fact that our health system is what it is. Certainly under the coalition government we did everything we could to ensure our health system was enhanced in taking over from the previous Labor government. I acknowledge all of the efforts—new bills and new drugs that any government, current or past, put onto the PBS—because they save lives. They, indeed, save lives. Our provision of health care for all Australians is the envy of most nations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But this is something we should never take for granted. We should make sure that we do everything we can to enhance it. When we were in government, we demonstrated our steadfast commitment to affordable health care for all Australians. We certainly did that in our nine years of government. I can remember the former health minister, the member for Flinders, being passionate about that. It was not just about health services and health care in Australia. During COVID-19 and the darkest days of the global pandemic—and we are still not out of it, by the way—there was the attention that he drew and the efforts that he made to ensure that Pacific island nations were looked after as far as vaccines, as far as health professionals and as far as making sure that we saved as many lives as we could.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am staggered by the fact that some of those opposite often ask, 'What did we get for the debt we are now in?' I know that the media has changed its tune in some sectors about where we are now and where we were just two short years ago. Some people have convenient memory loss as far as the situation that we were faced with. I was in those meetings when Professor Brendan Murphy said that we could lose tens of thousands of Australians in a matter of weeks if we did not act. We did act, and we made sure we did everything we could to get the vaccines rolled out, to get Australian lives put first and foremost, because that is the first priority of government. So I know the minister opposite is keen to ensure that this government also does what it should, builds upon the record we had and ensures Australians are looked after when it comes to their health system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also know that with Medicare and certainly bulk-billing we need to make sure, particularly in regional Australia and particularly in remote Australia, that Australians are looked after. Obviously we'll do everything we can, and I know the members with me here, Braddon and Barker, being regional members, know too how important it is to keep our health system front and centre, because regional Australians often don't get the health services and indeed the health professionals that they enjoy in capital cities. So anything that can be done by a Labor government or by the provision of bills and by the passing of bills to improve the lives and lots of those who live beyond the bright lights of our capital cities we should and we will indeed support, because our opposition leader, the member for Dickson, said—as did the Nationals leader, the member for Maranoa—that if there's good policy and there is good legislation put forward, we'll not only consider it but help the government pass it. Indeed we committed through our budgets $133 billion over four years to Medicare, including $31.4 billion in 2022-23, an increase of $7.3 billion compared to the 2021-22 budget, and we had those commitments going forward. Medicare and the PBS form the cornerstone of Australia's universal health system—a health system, as I said before, we should be very proud of. We saw record investment as a government in Medicare, and that was important for healthcare services no matter where people lived.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is drafted in almost identical terms to a bill introduced by the previous government in the 46th Parliament. It was not debated, and it lapsed upon dissolution of that parliament, prior to the 21 May election. This bill proposes to make a number of changes to the Commonwealth's health provider compliance program to strengthen the ability to recover debts owed by health providers who have engaged in inappropriate practice. We cannot have people engaging in inappropriate practice. I see the good member Dr Freelander up there, and I know he's going to speak next. I know how his constituents regarded his level of service when he was practising in his local area, and I commend him for the role that he played in that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The most significant amendments include new sanctions and increased maximum penalties for body corporates and nonpractitioners. Overall the proposed amendments appear to be uncontroversial and unopposed by stakeholders, although stakeholders have continued to raise broader concerns about the intricate nature of the Medicare system for healthcare providers and the challenges of complying with Medicare obligations in some instances. Importantly, this bill is comprised of one schedule, which is divided into four parts, and I'll just go through those for benefit of the House.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Part 1 amends the HIA to provide for a number of amendments to the operation of the Professional Services Review scheme, including allowing the director of the PSR to enter into agreements with body corporates. Part 2 amends the HIA, NHA and DBA to clarify that a person or body corporate owing a debt to the Commonwealth may make only one application to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal with respect to a reconsidered decision or notice of assessment of shared debt determination, even when multiple garnishing notices have been issued in relation to that debt. Part 3 makes a number of amendments to the HIA, NHA and DBE to clarify the Commonwealth's debt recovery arrangements following the passage of the Health Legislation Amendment (Improved Medicare Compliance and Other Measures) Bill 2018. Finally, part 4 amends the NHA and DBA respectively to replace references in those acts to making a false or misleading statement with references to the giving of false or misleading information.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These are all important. I note that the HIA, NHA and DBA set out a legislative framework for the provision of claiming of services and benefits with respect to the three major public health funding schemes: the Medicare Benefits Schedule, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and the Child Dental Benefits Schedule. That is good, and that is appropriate. I again place much importance on child dental appointments that parents should make. Before I became a parent, and certainly when I did become a parent, my mother always said to me that, if you look after your child's feet and if you look after their oral health, then the rest of it just about takes care of itself. That is important: put your kids in good school shoes, take them to the dentist every year and you can't go too far wrong. My mother, as always, was correct.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Medicare GP bulk-billing rate in the 12 months to June 2021, interestingly, was 88.8 per cent, up from 82.2 per cent in Labor's last year, that being 2012-13. I appreciate times change and practices alter, but it should be noted that that is a 6.6 per cent increase on what the Labor government achieved. And that is to be commended. That is a feather in our cap, when we were government. More than 152.2 million bulk-billed GP services were delivered in 2020-21. That was 46.4 million more than Labor's last year, in 2012-13. Sometimes those on this side get a bad rap when it comes to these things, but those figures do not lie; they tell a story. They tell a story about our commitment to a world-class health system. They tell a story about our commitment to Medicare GP bulk-billing and to making sure that GPs can offer that service and are doing well enough to survive and keep their doors open, particularly in rural and regional Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just last Friday I turned the first sod on the rural medical school in Wagga Wagga. That follows on from successful rural medical schools in other parts of regional New South Wales and Victoria, and that is going to make such a difference for the young people—and some not so young—who want to become GPs and want to do their training in a regional setting. If you train people from end to end, from start to finish, in a regional setting, chances are you'll keep them in that regional setting. Charles Sturt University, which is partnering with Western Sydney University in the rural medical school at Orange for their courses, generally claims that between 70 to 75 per cent of those students right across the spectrum of the course offerings they provide—given they are doing the tertiary education in a rural setting, whether it's Albury-Wodonga, whether it's Wagga Wagga or elsewhere—do actually stay in that regional setting. And they have an equally wonderful veterinarian course across the university's broad spectrum of offerings.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When I was Deputy Prime Minister, that was the first act I did—to make sure that rural medical school network was established. It's going to make such a difference. Already more than 20 students are at that UNSW course in Wagga Wagga. When they get the new three-storey building with the research and the educational components, it's going to make the world of difference. It's almost one of those cases of build it and they will come. If you build not only the right infrastructure but also the right services, put in place the right provisions in regional Australia, you'll get young people doing their medical training there and then staying there. It is so important.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That facility will open next year. It's not only going to be important for Wagga Wagga; it's going to be important for those smaller regional communities outside of even the Riverina electorate—places such as Deniliquin, Finley and Hillston and other areas that I do not represent. That's not what this is about. As a member of parliament, certainly a regional member of parliament, I should always be fighting for those services to be given to regional areas, because, my goodness, they do need them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the coalition March budget this year, we provided $66 million towards deregulating and expanding access to Medicare funded magnetic residence imaging, MRI, services in regional and—particularly importantly—remote Australia. We strengthened Medicare by making telehealth consultations permanent. That is a good thing. I don't ever want to see telehealth taking over wholly and solely from face-to-face appointments, because often general practitioners and other medical specialists need to see patients right in front of them to give them the correct diagnosis. But, certainly, during COVID lockdowns and the situation with remoteness, telehealth became very, very important.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the Riverina and Central West region, there have been more than 400,000 telehealth consultations funded through Medicare since the start of the pandemic. I thank people for their patience and for taking up this wonderful technological advancement. But I also thank the telehealth medical specialists, whether they're in a regional centre or a capital city, for being on hand to provide those services. In the year leading up to the March 2022 budget, the coalition government funded 2,414,195 free or subsidised medicines in the Riverina through the PBS. I know what a difference this made for long-term, long-time sufferers of debilitating illnesses. It makes such a difference when they can get that drug freely or when it is cheaply available to them. It changes their lives, and it changes their family's life.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">During the coalition's time in government, we made nearly 2,900 new or amended medicines listings through the PBS, and we should be congratulated for that. This is important proposed legislation, and I'm glad it's been brought to the House by the minister.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="265979" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr FREELANDER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macarthur</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:11</span>):  I'd like to thank the minister for bringing this proposed legislation to the parliament through the Health Legislation Amendment (Medicare Compliance and Other Measures) Bill 2022. It is important legislation, as has been noted. I'd also like to thank the member for Riverina for his kind words, and I understand that his community for some time has struggled to get access to high-level care and even primary care. He recognises, in an equitable manner, the importance of health care for his community and for the wider Australian community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is not by itself controversial. It strengthens the government's compliance powers with respect to inappropriate practice by corporations and improves the debt recovery process. It amends the Professional Services Review arrangements to manage and review the practice of corporations, not just single practitioners.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it's very important to look at the history of our national health insurance scheme to understand the Medicare compliance issues that have been made very prominent by the Nine newspaper group and media company's investigation. It's very important to understand that this is actually a system problem that relates to the history of the development of health services in Australia and the changes that have occurred in the last several decades. Medicare was based on the Whitlam government's first national health insurance program, Medibank, which was developed by Scotton and Deeble in the mid-1960s. Essentially, we are using the same system now that was developed in Australia in the 1960s.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, Medibank was removed by the Fraser government, and Medicare was introduced by the Hawke Labor government in 1984. In fact, I started my private medical practice in February 1984 in the same week that Medicare became available. For almost 40 years, my income relied on Medicare, and the process was very important to me. It meant that people in my community who had previously not been able to access care by a paediatrician or had been put on long waiting lists and sometimes missed out on accessing care could see a paediatrician, a general practitioner or other specialists in an equitable manner for themselves and for their families. It was a revolution, an absolute revolution. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Prior to 1984, the commonest cause of bankruptcy in Australia were medical costs. It's important to understand that Medicare changed that dramatically. It made a big difference to the ability of people in my community to access primary care and high-level care, and it was, as I said, a revolution. Practices changed over time, and in the last 10 years changes in illness patterns, changes in bulk-billing rates, changes in rebates have made our system much less equitable. There's been a collapse of the public hospital outpatient systems. Waiting lists now are sometimes measured in years, not months, and once again people are really struggling to access primary care. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The system is not designed to deal with the current age of chronic illness and an ageing population, so people are forced into non-compliance. Does fraud occur? Of course it does. This is a $50-billion scheme, and some people will not do the right thing. But those numbers are very small. Practitioners are almost forced into non-compliance with a scheme that doesn't deal with chronic illness, doesn't deal with patients with multiple system disorders, doesn't deal with the time it takes to deal with the social determinants of health—things like housing, medication costs, family issues, education. The medical system is not designed to deal with all these issues. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think that I am probably the only member of the House of Representatives or the parliament that really lived on Medicare repayments. I had a very high bulk-billing rate in my practice and tried to provide timely access to care for all of my patients, so I understand the system. We were subject to compliance checks—as we should have been—by regular review. I have never had a practice management review put in place because we spent a lot of time in my practice dealing with compliance issues, making sure we were billing appropriately, making sure we were not overordering pathology or radiology but rather working within the parameters that Medicare outlined. I think that is true for the vast majority of my colleagues. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian public of course has a right to know that every health dollar that they spend, or the government spends on their behalf using their taxes, is spent in the most efficient manner, and this is timely legislation because the other change that we've had in medicine over the last couple of decades is the increasing corporatisation of medicine. I worry about that a lot because often the publicly listed medical corporations have links to pathology providers, to radiology and imaging providers and to other health systems such as private hospitals et cetera. Again, that introduces a more complex addition to the simple visit to the local doctor. Many people that I see in my community do not have a general practitioner that they can name, and a recent survey at one of the public hospitals in my electorate's emergency department showed that almost 35 per cent of people presenting to the outpatient department didn't have a GP that they could name, and even more used the emergency department as their general practitioner. That's put enormous pressure on our health system. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the reasons is that the Medicare rebates were frozen by the previous government. Admittedly, it was started as a short-term measure by the Gillard Labor government to run for 12 months. This was extended to run for 10 years by the previous government. That has meant Medicare rebates have become less and less of the billing fee, which has meant there has been a disincentive for people to bulk bill and a disincentive for patients to see a general practitioner charging private fees, putting more pressure on our public hospital system. We know that our public hospital system has been under enormous pressure during the pandemic and afterwards.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also know that recently there has been real difficulty in getting medical students to train as general practitioners. Partly that relates to income, but it also partly relates to quality of practice and lifestyle. We need to look at ways we can encourage more people into general practice, which remains the cornerstone of our health service.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's great to have fellow medical practitioners in the House today: the member for Mackellar, a very experienced general practitioner; the member for Kooyong, a paediatric neurologist; the member for Robertson, an emergency doctor. It's great to have them here, and I think they will provide some extra insights into this legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would say that, whilst this legislation is important, it is even more important in this day and age to see this as a system problem and to see how we can refit the Medicare system to deal with the age of chronic illness and an ageing population. We've also heard talk of medical students being enlisted by the New South Wales government to work in hospital situations to provide some extra manpower. I think that's a good thing. It's good for the medical students, and I think it's good for our system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've also heard of trials using pharmacists to prescribe for certain conditions, and I have no problem with that. I think that it is important that everyone in the health system works to the maximum scope of practice. But I also see huge difficulties within the pharmacy system with restrictions on practice and restrictions on prescription, where people who may have been on medication for 20 years have to go into a pharmacy every month to get a repeat prescription. This is wrong; it's very inefficient. It puts extra costs in the system and I'm sure could be modified to make our system even more efficient.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think there are many ways that we can improve our health system if we look at how the health system itself deals with the new age. There are many issues also in our dental scheme, which is only very partially applicable. It's leading to severe inequalities in access to dental care: No. 1, particularly in children—my own specialty—but also in the elderly. Many elderly people have difficulty with nutrition, partly at least because of a lack of access to adequate dental care. Our system needs to be modified to deal with this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I've said previously, there is this tie-up with corporate medicine and pathology and radiology. I think that adds another possible area of difficulty within the system that needs to be really examined in close detail.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've heard from previous managers of the Medicare compliance section. Dr Tony Webber, who I know very well, is a very honourable and a very experienced general practitioner who has raised concerns about compliance issues with Medicare, and we would be right to listen to his concerns about this. The previous manager of the compliance system, Professor Julie Quinlivan, has also given some very good information about how the compliance system could be improved.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">From my point of view, as a still-practising paediatrician, the Medicare system has been vital to providing equitable care across our greater Australian community. Unfortunately, times have changed, illness patterns have changed and the delivery of health care has dramatically changed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There have been remarkable advances in digital medicine. I recently saw a digital stethoscope that can be placed on the patient's chest. It can do an ECG and record the heart sounds. This can all be transmitted remotely to the computer or even the phone of a GP or specialist. This is another remarkable advancement, and another way of looking at how we can best manage the telehealth system, which has been really important. We were more or less forced into it by the pandemic, but I think it is really important that we take full advantage—particularly in outer metropolitan, rural and regional areas—of the telehealth system, which should be expanded. We also need to see what advances can be made in keeping people out of hospital and managing their illnesses at home. There's much to be said for the hospital and home type of system, with better systems of managing things like heart failure, respiratory infection, asthma, diabetes and a whole range of different illnesses that can be safely managed at home with appropriate resources. It's really important for us as a new Labor government to make sure we take full advantage of these new advances.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our electronic health records in Australia are so far behind the rest of the developed world. We really need to look at how we can improve our digital health records and make sure that we take full advantage of the cost savings and the efficiencies that would cause. We should try to update our systems so they are all compatible across private and public medicine, across our hospital system, and among general practitioners. I commend this legislation, but it is only part of the job. I know that the Albanese Labor government will continue the changes in health care that we need to deal with our ageing and growing population.</span>

In fact, to all of those in the chamber from all sides, I recognise your contribution to the medical fraternity this afternoon. I rise to speak on the Health Legislation Amendment (Medicare Compliance and Other Measures) Bill 2022. The bill amends the Health Insurance Act of 1973, the National Health Act of 1953 and the Dental Benefits Act of 2008. In broad terms, the bill aims to protect the viability and ongoing integrity of Medicare, it includes the Medicare Benefits Scheme and Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia has a world-class system. Our provision of health care to all Australians is the envy of most nations. But this is something we should never take for granted. Medicare is something that we must protect. The Liberal and Nationals government demonstrated our steadfast commitment to affordable health care for all the Austrians during our nine years in government. Even during the most significant economic and health crisis that our country has seen in over 100 years, our commitment to provide health services that Australians expect remained resolute. The coalition was able to continue to invest in our nation's health services, even during dire economic headwinds, because our economic response to COVID and the pandemic was also world-leading. In March, the coalition delivered the largest and fastest improvement in the budget bottom line in over 70 years, and this improvement allowed us to commit to the largest investment health services in history. This was demonstrated through our ongoing commitment to Medicare.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Liberal and Nationals government was committed to investing $133 billion over four years in Medicare, including $31.4 billion in 2022-23—an increase of $7.3 billion compared to the 2021-22 budget. We committed $32.3 billion in 2023-24, $33.9 billion in 2024-25, and $35½ billion in 2025-26. The coalition oversaw record investment in Medicare. Importantly, this investment ensured that all Australians had access to healthcare services, no matter where they lived, whether they lived in the city or the bush, and no matter how old they were.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Medicare and the PBS form the cornerstone of Australia's universal health system. Medicare provides free or subsidised access to most healthcare services for all Australians. The Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, PBS, delivers affordable life-saving medications to all Australians. In fact, in our term of government, we delivered around 2,900 new or amended listings on the PBS at an overall investment of around $16½ billion. Where I live, we used to call it the 'PB-Yes' rather than the PBS. The coalition's commitment to list every recommended drug ensured that Australians had access to affordable, life-saving medications that would otherwise cost thousands or sometimes hundreds of thousands of dollars without the PBS subsidy. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to the bill, this supports the integrity of the Medicare Benefits Schedule, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Schedule and the Child Dental Benefits Schedule by addressing inappropriate practice, protecting payment integrity, encouraging compliance with claiming requirements and supporting consistency. This bill is the same legislation introduced by the former coalition government, in the 46th Parliament, by the Health Legislation Amendment (Medicare Compliance and Other Measures) Bill 2021. That bill was not debated and it lapsed upon dissolution of the parliament. Our bill reflected the coalition's commitment to protecting the integrity and financial viability of Medicare, ensuring that all Australians had access to our world-leading health system. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to acknowledge our hardworking, dedicated health professionals, as I did at the beginning of my address. They work tirelessly to continue to provide the care our local communities so desperately need. That care is often given in the face of enormous challenges whilst, in the vast majority of cases, much more than they can ever be remunerated for. There are a very small number who do not. I acknowledge that sometimes oversights and administrative errors occur. I want to assure our healthcare sector and all those hardworking folk I just described that this bill is not striving to correct minor oversights. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We must be careful, in this conversation we're having right now, that we don't paint every hardworking general practitioner with the same brush. In fact, our government had a strong track record of supporting hardworking healthcare professionals and peak bodies to correctly claim healthcare payments, with a clear focus on education, engagement and consultation. But we need to weed out our fraudulent or abusive practitioners who take advantage of our nation's Medicare system. Australians rightly expect that their hard-earned tax dollars are being used appropriately and effectively, particularly when they are spent in our health system, which is facing increasing pressures. To safeguard the ongoing viability of Medicare, however, we must ensure that our compliance system is rigorous enough to identify those who choose to abuse the system. We must protect, at all cost, the integrity of the Medicare system. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The primary intention of the bill is to strengthen the compliance and powers of the Professional Services Review, the PSR, which is the agency responsible for reviewing and examining possible and appropriate practices relating to Medicare or the PBS, and add a degree of flexibility to the PSR's ability to address any inappropriate practice or practices. The bill proposes to make a number of changes to the Commonwealth health provider compliance program to strengthen the ability of the Commonwealth, to recover debts owed by healthcare providers and those who have engaged in inappropriate practice. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The most significant amendments include new sanctions and increased maximum penalties for body corporates and non-practitioners. The bill comprises one schedule that is divided into four parts. Part 1 amends the HIA to provide for a number of amendments to the operation of the Professional Services Review scheme, including allowing the director of the PSR to enter agreements with body corporates. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Part 2 amends the HIA, NHA and DBA to clarify that a person or body corporate owing a debt to the Commonwealth may only make one application to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal with respect to a reconsidered decision or a notice of reassessment or a shared debt determination, even when multiple garnishees notices have been issued in relation to the said debt. Part 3 makes a number of amendments to the HIA, NHA and DBA to clarify the Commonwealth's debt recovery arrangements following the passage of the Health Legislation Amendment (Improve Medicare compliance and Other Measures) Bill 2018. Finally, part 4 amends the HIA, NHA and DBA to replace references in those acts to making a false or misleading statement, with references to the giving of false or misleading information. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, it's one of my greatest privileges to regularly meet with representatives of our great healthcare sector. They are always willing to take on the heavy lifting. They are always there in our time of need. Over the past three years we've called on their services like never before. Day in, day out they have been there on the front line of the COVID pandemic. Their dedication cannot be overstated or repaid, and it is important to note that this bill in no way impacts our incredible health providers who are practising legitimately. I want to recognise that most are going above and beyond to provide the level of care that their patients so desperately need, often forgoing their own full wage or personal time in order to deliver that care. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But we must be continually mindful of further burdening our already overstretched healthcare providers with additional regulation or complexity in an already complex Medicare system. Therefore I acknowledge and welcome the government's commitment that they will continue to support the coalition provided practitioners and healthcare organisations who comply with their obligations, with a focus on education as well as ongoing engagement with peak bodies. However, where benefits are incorrectly or fraudulently paid, it is vital to the public interest that the Commonwealth expenditure is protected and that those debts are recovered. This will support further investments in health initiatives that all Australians will benefit from. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Once again the Albanese Labor government is demonstrating its commitment to passing copies of coalition legislation. In doing so the government has recognised that the coalition were leaders when it comes to this important healthcare policy and improving the sustainability of Australia's world-class health system for the benefit of all Australians. The opposition will support the passage of this legislation. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr RYAN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kooyong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:38</span>):  I rise to speak to the Health Legislation Amendment (Medicare Compliance and Other Measures) Bill 2022 as a relatively new member of this House but also as a medical clinician with long professional experience of Medicare. This amendment in and of itself is appropriate. It's not particularly consequential, but my concern is that it reflects several aspect of the systemic malaise of our public healthcare system. Many of these aspects were spoken to earlier by my friend and colleague the member for Macarthur. I wish to take the opportunity to note my concerns in the House today. Medicare is an extraordinarily important part of the Australian healthcare landscape. The fundamental principles of the Medicare system are true to what the Australian people want, need and deserve: universality, shared Commonwealth and state responsibility for public hospital care and a universal insurance against medical costs, including via bulk billing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Health Insurance Act, National Health Act and Dental Benefits Act set out the legislative framework for the provision and claiming of services and benefits with respect to all three of our major public health funding schemes: the Medicare Benefits Schedule, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Schedule and the Child Dental Benefits Scheme. The Medicare Benefits Schedule is Australia's most important health insurance scheme. It subsidises the cost of selected medical services for eligible patients provided by eligible practitioners.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the PBS, the Australian government subsidises the cost of medicine for most medical conditions. Services Australia administers MBS, PBS and CDBS on behalf of the health department and makes its payments. The purpose of the Professional Services Review scheme is to review and investigate the provision of services by practitioners and to determine whether those practitioners have engaged in inappropriate practice. To overcome issues with inappropriate billing for services, this parliament has already in recent years passed three other bills aimed at improving health provider compliance arrangements. These were the health legislation amendments of 2018 and 2019 and the Health Insurance Amendment (Administration) Bill 2020.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill before us today includes a single schedule divided into four parts, which includes several amendments to the Professional Services Review scheme, changes around appeals to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and revisions to the Commonwealth's debt recovery arrangements for the HIA, the NHA and the DBA. Put broadly, the intent of this bill is to extend the scope of the Professional Services Review to enter into agreements with corporate entities and to ensure consistency across the health administration sector on the Commonwealth's debt recovery processes and in relation to the giving of false or misleading information.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We all know that the Medicare system is not perfect. In the 2018-19 financial year, the Australian National Audit Office reported that Health recovered $49.3 million in claims which should not have been paid and $123 million in estimated savings through changes in the claiming behaviour of providers. All principled medical professionals will support measures aimed at preserving the integrity of Medicare and optimising the use of our limited healthcare resources by preventing wrongful claiming.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are, however, concerns which have been expressed by the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners amongst others about the proposed procedural fairness and the transparency of this expansion of the PSR scheme as proposed in this bill. Firstly, this bill proposes that the director of the PSR should be able to enter into agreements with non-practitioners and bodies corporate. While most general practices are privately owned by GPs, there are many other ownership models, including shareholder owned, publicly listed companies.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government needs to have different regulatory expectations of corporate entities of varying sizes and resources as compared to smaller individual practices. There is with this bill a real risk of increased compliance burden on smaller practices, particularly in rural areas, which could reduce the capacity for those doctors to provide high-quality care to patients while their practices are under investigation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Similarly, the increased penalties in this bill for the refusal or failure to produce documents or information suggests a focus on cost recovery and punitive approaches to compliance, which may exacerbate existing concerns in the profession about the intent of compliance activities. Expansion of the power of the director to publish information about a person who has not fulfilled their obligations under a section 92 agreement is a breach of privacy which could have a significant impact on individual practitioners. The increase in sanctions and the broader debt collecting powers prescribed by this bill reflect a really punitive approach to compliance, rather than an educator focus helping practitioners to bill correctly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The truth is that anyone who has engaged with this process will tell you that Medicare billing is extremely complex. There are innumerable legal instruments around Medicare billing. These add up to more than 7,300 pages of acts, regulations, determinations, rules, directions, terms and conditions, schedules, website pages and guides. This excludes private health insurance medical fee schedules, the state and territory health acts, the contents of the MBS Online website and various other sources.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Feedback from GPs tells us that increased Medicare compliance activities and the fear of being audited are distracting them from their primary focus, which is and should always be the delivery of high-quality, patient-centred care. This fear creates a significant conflict between the administrative obligations that GPs need to adhere to, as set out by this legislation, and their commitment to patient care.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">GPs are the foundation of our healthcare system. General practice provides 177 million services a year to approximately 24 million people in Australia. There has in recent years been unprecedented demand for healthcare services as our population ages and rates of chronic disease and psychological stress increase. Hospital and emergency department demands continue to skyrocket, resulting in ambulance ramping, suboptimal healthcare delivery, poorer patient outcomes and increasing secondary and tertiary health expenditure. Decades of significant underfunding and cost cutting have left our general practices on the verge of collapse. Almost half of our practising GPs have indicated that it is no longer financially sustainable for them to continue working in general practice. The proportion of bulk-billed GP services recently dropped for the first time in two decades. Experts predict a shortfall of 11,390 GPs, or almost 28 per cent of the GP workforce, by 2032. Medical student interest in general practice as a career is now at a low of just 13.8 per cent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The COVID-19 pandemic, recent natural disasters and the health and mental health issues resulting from them have compounded these issues, highlighting the gaps and inequities in the current delivery of primary care, exacerbating workforce burnout and draining resources within general practices. It was a peculiar, cruel insult that the previous government did not consider GPs to be frontline workers, although they were in the vanguard of the COVID-19 pandemic response. In addition to the increasing costs of living, out-of-pocket costs for patients accessing their GPs have increased by 48 per cent in the past decade, reflecting how Medicare patient rebates have failed to keep pace with the growing cost of delivering health care. We need to support our GPs. We have to make general practice more attractive to medical graduates.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to stop accusing overworked, often underpaid professionals of widespread systemic abuse of the Medicare system. There have been recent claims of widespread Medicare abuse by doctors and other healthcare providers made by the <span style="font-style:italic;">Sydney Morning Herald</span>, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Age</span> and the ABC which suggest that the realities of ambulance ramping, public hospitals not coping and general practices being in tatters are all due to doctors defrauding Medicare. In fact, instances of proven Medicare fraud are minuscule. The most recent report of the Professional Services Review itself found fewer than a hundred instances of proven inappropriate practice in 2020-21. The sum total of these ill-gotten gains, all of which was recovered, was $24 million, a far cry from the fanciful $8 billion claimed by a gotcha media culture concerned less with the truth than with a cheap, demeaning headline.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In fact, a recent Healthed survey confirmed that most doctors actually deliberately underbill. More than two-thirds of doctors surveyed underbilled most days. GPs, especially female GPs, spend as much as 14 per cent of their time on non-billable activities. These non-billable activities include patient care, arranging tests, arranging referrals, consulting specialists, talking to allied health professionals, renewing medications and providing advice and education. If the true cost of under-billed services was included in this accounting, the figures would show that in fact Medicare is rorting our GPs, so we should not be surprised, when our GPs were asked about the impact of that recent media coverage on their view of their own practice, that they described it as soul-destroying, disappointing and insulting. Many felt that the conflation of unintentionally incorrect billing, mostly due to very understandable confusion about Medicare rules, with intentional rorting was a very serious flaw in the media representation of why Medicare is failing GPs and the public. I received a letter from a GP in my own electorate of Kooyong that called these claims 'damaging' and 'sensationalist'. He said that he will continue to be 'scared to bill appropriately for fear of appearing to rort the system'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendment we're debating today is a small thing. It's just a tinker on the edges of a very large problem. There seems to be no appetite or vision from this or other governments for what we need, which is large-scale generational reform of our healthcare system. Medicare is 50 years old. We need our federal government to work with our states and territories to provide better primary care across our jurisdictions. We need to prevent health care from being just another political football between the federal government and state jurisdictions. We need to protect our GPs. We need to treat them with respect, not suspicion.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need Medicare—that wonderful universal scheme—to be better, smarter, more generous and more suited to the 21st century. We need to stop tinkering around the edges. We need a better and clearer vision of what we can achieve together. I commend this bill to the House.</span>

We've been here for 15 years. For the entire period that I've been here, I have been on about the disparity in health services between regional and rural areas and the city. Despite enormous effort—I note the member for Kooyong's comments, and I'm not suggesting here that there is large-scale Medicare fraud—there are some very low value medical services being offered in places. We know Medicare item numbers are accessed in the city at double the rate they are in the country. I'm not saying for one instance that we need twice as many doctors in the country as we have now, but I guarantee you that we need more. I would also say that, on the other hand, there are definitely more services. Medicare is being debited more often in the city than it should. That's not to say the service is a fraud. But is it really necessary? That's a question that I think we have to deal with.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the 2018-19 budget, the coalition put the 10-year, $550 million Stronger Rural Health Strategy in place. I understand it delivered 700 extra GPs and 700 extra nurses in the first two years. Out where I live, you'd have to ask where they are—but I'm told those are the numbers—and it's getting worse. We've had a plethora of programs designed to address this issue of GP under-servicing in the country. We have the Rural Health Multidisciplinary Training program, and the 2019-20 budget delivered $62 million to establish and deliver the National Rural Generalist Pathway as well. We have the Australian General Practice Training Program and the Rural Junior Doctor Training Innovation Fund. We've injected $65 million into the rural bulk-billing incentives, which started in January this year. The Workforce Incentive Program, of around $390 million per annum, provides incentives to deliver primary healthcare services in rural, regional and remote Australia. We have the Rural Health Outreach Fund and the Rural Locum Assistance Program.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All of these programs are in the tens of millions of dollars, and I'm here to tell you that the services in the country are still going backwards. It's not through a lack of trying, a lack of effort or a lack of money, but, somewhere along the line, the programs aren't hitting the spot and aren't attracting enough doctors to the country. Not only are they not attracting enough doctors into the country but also they're not attracting enough doctors into GP services—into a GP specialist service, if you like.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I come from the north-eastern Eyre Peninsula. There are five major towns across the northern Eyre Peninsula—Streaky Bay, Wudinna, Kimba, Cleve and Cowell—with an estimated total population of about 7,500. Currently, we have three full-time-equivalent resident doctors, so that is a ratio of about 2,500 to one. I heard some news on the weekend—some bad news, I'd have to say—and I rung up the community where the doctors live. Two of them have announced that they are leaving. That will leave us with one doctor for 7,500 people. I would say that is worse than a crisis; that is an absolute train wreck.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">SA Health is trying to fill the gaps with locums. They are way too expensive. Locums can be paid up to $3,000 a day, way beyond what a local resident practitioner would get. We need to get more local practitioners on the ground to address this bleed-off of health funds. There's another problem with locums. God bless them. When I need one, I go to them and I am very grateful that they are there. But it would be fair to say that, if I had a long, ongoing illness, it would be impossible to build up a familial link to that doctor. Every time you go to a new doctor, you have to explain your situation again. Is there any real incentive for a locum to get to the bottom of what is a long-term, difficult issue? It is so much easier to flick it down the road, quite frankly.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll come back to the Medicare items and the fact that they are accessed at double the rate in the city to what they are in the country and how we need to do something about it. In 2019, I convinced Greg Hunt that it would be a very good idea to come to South Australia. We did a series of workshops around the Grey electorate. When we came to Eyre Peninsula, in Kimba, my hometown, he met with the Northern Eyre Peninsula Health Alliance. That was September 2019. Disturbed by the severity of the problem, he left $300,000 on the table for NEPHA to come up with a solution built from the ground up. That report was delivered to Greg Hunt in the early weeks of this year. He was very impressed. He said it was the best report he had ever seen developed by a local community to try and address their own problems. But it required a state contribution and, in the way of elections and our democracy, we hit the South Australian state election first and then we had the federal election and we didn't manage to land a deal between the two governments before we went into caretaker mode.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I gave that report to Minister Butler soon after he was appointed health minister, and NEPHA also sent him a copy and requested a meeting. I have written to Minister Butler. I've spoken to Minister Butler. Six months into the job and he has still not found time to meet with this organisation that was provided with $300,000 of public funds to come up with a solution to a problem where we are now facing down the barrel of 7,500 patients to one doctor. I'd say that's an emergency, and the health minister, who's from South Australia, needs to get himself acquainted with this good mob of people from South Australia to discuss the issues on Eyre Peninsula, which I think are at the pointy end of the stick of doctor shortages around Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We had a restricted pipeline through the early 2000s and it led to the situation where we were importing a lot of doctors into Australia. It was one of those things where the choke was kept on too long after the overservicing of the 1990s. But, in any case, numbers have ramped up again. They're turning out about 4,000 a year. There are 30,000 GPs or thereabouts practising in Australia. With 4,000 a year, even if only half of them wanted to be GPs, that should be enough to backfill the problem, to fill up the shortage. But we are finding that less than 15 per cent of medical graduates actually want to become GPs. Why is that? We could talk about status. We can certainly talk about money. If only 15 per cent of medical graduates want to become GPs, it stands reason to me—and I did maths at my rural school—that means 85 per cent of them want to be specialists. How is it that there can be enough money in the Medicare system to support 85 per cent of those graduates to go on and become specialists, unless something is going wrong in the payment system? That's why I support this legislation. Maybe it doesn't go far enough. I'm not saying that there is widescale rorting going on, but there is certainly the misapplication of public funds, because we are funding services and overservicing where we don't need them. We don't need 85 per cent of our medical graduates becoming specialists. It would be a far better ratio if, in fact, we had 85 per cent wanting to be GPs. Even 50 to 50 would be a huge improvement on where we are. That over specialisation, that referral system that sits within our medical system at the moment, is a complete drain on taxpayers' funds and it is a waste of money. There is a whole lot of low-value medicine going on here, and, if we're going to actually do something about this shortage, which is delivering one doctor for every 7½ thousand people, we're going to have to get to the nub of those problems.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just to reiterate, we couldn't be in this position unless there was financial incentive for it to occur. As we know, most of the money that is earned in the health sector comes from the Medicare system. It draws and holds GPs to the city for lifestyle reasons. It's enticing medical graduates into the specialist stream for reasons of finance—and perhaps prestige and working hours. Either way, we need a workforce that is fit for duty. We need to fashion this workforce completely differently, and I don't think we can do it unless we attack those fundamental levers which are providing the financial incentives in the system. In this case, the Health Legislation Amendment (Medicare Compliance and Other Measures) Bill 2022 is about making sure there is less illegality in the system. I hope it also goes the distance to inquire where and how taxpayers' dollars are being spent and if they can be spent more appropriately to bring about a fairer result.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cooper</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister for Health and Aged Care</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:02</span>):  Further to my remarks earlier, I would like to add that the Labor Party has no prouder legacy than our contribution to universal health coverage in Australia, most importantly through the two key pillars in Medicare and the PBS. The Albanese government is committed to protecting and strengthening our world-class Medicare system. I'd like to thank the members for Riverina, Macarthur, Braddon, Kooyong and Grey for their important contributions to this debate today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia's universal healthcare system, Medicare, provides free or subsidised access for all Australians to most healthcare services. The Health Legislation Amendment (Medicare Compliance and Other Measures) Bill 2022 strengthens Medicare compliance powers and will assist with the investigation and recovery of debts associated with inappropriate Medicare billing. Medicare, including the Medicare Benefits Schedule, or the MBS, and the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, or the PBS, will continue to provide Australians with access to free hospital care and more affordable health care and medicines. The Child Dental Benefits Scheme, or the CDBS, provides access to dental services for children. The Australian government's expenditure on the MBS, the PBS and the CDBS is projected to be nearly $44 billion in 2021-22.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As stewards of this investment in the health of Australians, the government are committed to protecting the integrity and financial viability of Medicare, ensuring that Australians may continue to have access to our world-class health system. While the vast majority of healthcare providers do the right thing when claiming Medicare benefits, there is unfortunately a small number that do not. In most cases, these are a result of mistakes and administrative errors, but, in some cases, these are a result of incorrect or inappropriate claiming and, at worst, fraud. The Department of Health and Aged Care supports practitioners, healthcare organisations and peak bodies to correctly claim health payments with a clear focus on education, engagement and consultation. However, ensuring rigorous, effective health practitioner compliance and identifying healthcare practitioners that are not doing the right thing are vital to protecting the integrity of Medicare.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Historically, compliance activities have concentrated on the behaviour of individual practitioners, on the principle that practitioners are ultimately responsible for what is billed under their Medicare provider numbers. While this principle remains critical, the government needs to adapt its compliance arrangements to an environment where corporations are employing or otherwise engaging practitioners and are increasingly involved in, and influencing the provision of, healthcare services.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The primary intent of this bill is both to strengthen the compliance powers of the Professional Services Review, or the PSR, and to add a degree of flexibility to the PSR's ability to address the inappropriate practice of corporations. The bill is in four parts. Part 1 amends the PSR scheme, part 2 amends certain debt-recovery decisions, part 3 amends miscellaneous debt recovery arrangements and part 4 amends the giving of false or misleading information.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The PSR addresses the behaviour of practitioners that may have engaged in inappropriate practice through review by the director or by committees comprised of professional peers of the person under review. As an alternative to lengthy, resource-intensive reviews by a committee, the director may enter into written agreements with practitioners who are prepared to acknowledge their inappropriate practice and agree to specified actions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The PSR may also review the practice of corporations that have knowingly, recklessly or negligently caused or permitted their practitioners to engage in inappropriate practice. Currently, such conduct by a body corporate may be reviewed only by a committee. The bill amends section 92 of the Health Insurance Act 1973, which authorises the making of agreements with the director, to ensure all persons under review have the opportunity to negotiate an agreement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There can be significant consequences for an individual or body corporate referred to a committee, including publication of findings. However, agreements made under section 92 are confidential, and this encourages cooperation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In essence, the bill extends provisions for written agreements currently applicable only to individual practitioners to include a practitioner who personally renders or initiates services; an individual, who may be a practitioner, who employs or otherwise engages practitioners; an officer, who may be a practitioner, of a body corporate which employs or otherwise engages practitioners; or a body corporate which employs or otherwise engages practitioners.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The new provisions allow the director to come to an agreement with a person under review, including a body corporate or nonpractitioner, who acknowledges inappropriate practice and agrees to specified actions. The specified actions for bodies corporate may include repayment of Medicare or dental benefits paid for services that were rendered or initiated during the review period, a reprimand by the director, counselling by the director, and a requirement for the body corporate under review to provide remediating education to persons that it employs or engages.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To be clear, a corporation's acknowledgement of inappropriate practice has no bearing on the practitioners it employs or otherwise engages. Individual practitioners will not be named in agreements with corporations or other persons who employ or otherwise engage practitioners, and such agreements are themselves confidential.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In entering into an agreement with the director, a body corporate or other person who employs or otherwise engages practitioners would acknowledge that they engaged in inappropriate practice by knowingly, recklessly or negligently causing or permitting one or more of its practitioners to engage in inappropriate practice. That acknowledgement is not binding on any individual practitioner, nor does it result in any findings being made in relation to individual practitioners.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If an individual practitioner were the subject of a separate referral, they would have the option to seek an agreement with a director or to proceed to review by a committee. The acknowledgement by the person who employed or otherwise engaged the practitioner would not be put before the committee, and a finding of inappropriate practice could only be made following an examination of an appropriate example of clinical records and evidence from the practitioner or any other witnesses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a consequence of the new provisions relating to corporations, and to maintain its peer review function, the bill adjusts the composition of the determining authority so that it may include additional members of the same profession as the relevant practitioners engaged or employed by the person under review.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's commitment to improving compliance is embodied in new sanctions against behaviour that stymies the government's ability to review inappropriate practice and to recover Commonwealth debts created by agreements between persons under review and the director.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill creates an exception to the general rule that agreements made under section 92 are confidential by giving the director the discretion to publish details of an agreement where the person under review has not fulfilled their obligations. The person under review will have an opportunity to make submissions about their compliance or otherwise. To further protect the integrity of the scheme against persons, particularly corporations, reneging on agreed terms, the government will have the ability to garnish bank accounts, bringing repayments under section 92 agreements in line with other debt recovery provisions currently permitted under the Health Insurance Act 1973. Garnishee notices will only be issued if persons under review do not promptly engage with the department on repayment or breach an agreement to pay the debt by instalments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Access to information is essential for the PSR to carry out reviews. The bill introduces offences for persons under review that fail to appear at committee hearings or fail to give evidence or answer questions where required by committees. Maximum penalties for noncompliance will be fines of 150 penalty units, or $33,300 at current rates, for bodies corporate and 30 penalty units, or $6,660 at current rates, for non-practitioner individuals.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also provides for an offence where a person, other than a person under review who is a practitioner, fails to respond to a notice to provide documents to the director or to a committee with fines of up to 30 penalty units. The PSR will also be able to take court action seeking a civil penalty of up to 30 penalty units, currently $6,660 each, for each day that a body corporate contravenes the Health Insurance Act 1973 by failing to respond to a notice to provide documents. Further, the director will be able to apply for court orders for a body corporate to comply with notices.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Following recent observations of the Federal Court regarding jurisdictional fact, the bill also clarifies that a referral to the PSR may be made where it appears that there is the possibility that a person may have engaged in inappropriate practice in the provision of services. Under the PSR scheme, it is ultimately a matter for the PSR to investigate whether a person has provided services and whether the conduct of the person under review in relation to the rendering or initiation of those services amounts to inappropriate practice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also addresses inconsistencies arising from the introduction of legislation in 2018 to improve debt recovery powers under the Health Insurance Act 1973, the National Health Act 1953 and the Dental Benefits Act 2008. The bill introduces amendments clarifying the application of debt recovery provisions, the use of financial information powers, the recovery of Commonwealth debts from estates, the recovery of interest on Commonwealth debts and the administrative penalties for debts under the Shared Debt Recovery Scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, the bill amends the National Health Act 1953 and the Dental Benefits Act 2008 to mirror recent changes to the Health Insurance Act 1973. The December 2020 amendments to the Health Insurance Act 1973 clarified that the Commonwealth may recover incorrect payments made as a result of the giving of false or misleading information. Maintaining universal access to health care through Medicare is a priority for this government. The bill protects the integrity of Medicare for all Australians, and I commend the bill to the House.</span>
                </p>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="HWT" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ROBERT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fadden</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:16</span>):  While the government will ensure passage of the bill, we find ourselves in an extraordinary circumstance that I've not seen in 15 years—I doubt if the honourable ministers opposite have seen it in 15 years. It's to do with schedule 5 of the Tax Law Amendment (2022 Measures No. 3) Bill 2022, where amendments were moved by the opposition to strike out faith based super. We did that having met with APRA to work out if there were faith based communities that could not invest in various products because of their faith. That would limit it to approximately two per cent of the listed Australian share market as one example of an investment strategy, and a faith based fund would still have access to 98 per cent of the market. On that principle alone, the opposition took a principled position that Australians of faith should not have a lesser form of retirement because of their faith. The minister of the day, who I see is not here defending this extraordinary situation, said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I might not share the religious beliefs of Australians who choose to invest their superannuation in a particular fund, but I 100 per cent support their ability to choose that fund—</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">by the way, so do we—</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">and I don't think it should be the role of the Australian government to shut that fund down because that fund happens to operate in accordance with religious and faith based investing principles. I might not agree with them, but I will defend to my last breath, as the saying goes, their right to hold those beliefs and to invest in accordance with those beliefs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, the minister's fight to the last breath lasted all of five minutes, because rather than the government voting on the opposition's amendment in the Senate, the minister put in his own amendment—exactly the same as the opposition's—to strike out the schedule on faith based super. They just put it first so the Senate would have to vote on the government's amendment to strike it out, and then there was no need for the opposition's amendment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When the Sergeant Schultz of the Senate, also known as the Minister for Financial Services, was asked, 'Isn't this exactly the same as the opposition's amendment?' he answered, after some blustering and some yes and some no, 'Yes, it is.' It is extraordinary that when an amendment came up from the opposition it was fiercely voted down in this House, and the minister said 'I might not agree with them, but I will defend to my last breath'—well, that defence went tumbling down when the government brought in exactly the same amendment as the opposition. They snuck it in first—as is the right of the government—so that the government wouldn't have to say they lost a vote on the floor of the Senate. The government's pride wouldn't allow them to say that they'd lost the first vote in the Senate, so they replicated to the word, to the jot and to the tittle, to quote the Good Book—it's Hebrew, Minister—</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberInterjecting">Ms Catherine King:</span>
                    </a>  Yes, I know.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="HWT" type="MemberContinuation">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr ROBERT:</span>
                    </a>  those two smallest Hebrew characters exactly so that they wouldn't lose a vote. Therefore, they put their own amendment in that exactly matches the opposition's to knock out faith based super. This could be the first time I've ever seen a government knockout one of their own election commitments after defending it on the floor of the House and then putting their own amendment in. It is a blue or black or some letter day because I haven't seen it before.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So I say to the minister, who is not here—he's left it to his junior Treasury minister, who is an accomplished academic, no less—to actually fight this one out, because the minister was saying that he would defend to his last breath the right for those funds to invest in accordance with their beliefs. That is, until that breath was required of him in the Senate.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The opposition will of course support passage of the TLAB Bill No. 3 through the floor of the House because it contains a number of important provisions. But I do say to the House: we took a principled position that all Australians, regardless of age, sex, creed, race, religion or otherwise, should have the same access to a quality retirement and that everyone should have the same set of rules when it comes to their retirement. Super should not have carve outs based on any provision, but all Australians, all created equally, should have the same right and the same provisions. The opposition will support the passage of the bill.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Shipping services are vitally important to Australia and the wellbeing of our economy. Australia is the fifth largest user of shipping services in the world. Ten per cent of the world's sea trade passes through Australian ports, with international shipping carrying over 99 per cent of Australia's imports and exports by volume. A critical component of Australia's domestic freight task, around 15 per cent, is also carried by coastal shipping.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The environmentally safe use of the seas, including in Australian waters, by that large shipping task is equally important to Australians. We take our responsibilities for safety and environment protection in maritime very seriously.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Over time, the global shipping standards-setting body, the International Maritime Organization, has progressively improved marine environment pollution standards for ships through the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships and the International Convention on the Control of Harmful Anti-Fouling Systems on Ships, amongst others.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As Australia is a signatory to both these conventions, we have an obligation to bring our domestic maritime environment protection legislation up to date with globally agreed amendments.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our domestic implementation of international marine environment protection regulations demonstrates our longstanding commitment to the protection of the marine environment and our active participation in the IMO as the means to achieve that protection.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Firstly, it will introduce controls for ship discharges that are known as 'persistent floaters'—substances that can form surface slicks on water, such as some grades of vegetable oil or paraffin-like substances.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These controls, which include cargo tank cleaning, pre-wash and discharge procedures, apply in certain environmentally sensitive areas in Europe, specifically in north-west European waters, the Baltic Sea, western European waters and the Norwegian Sea.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, the bill will ban the use, and carriage for use, of heavy fuel oil by ships in Arctic waters from 1 July 2024. This mirrors the ban already in place on the use of heavy fuel oil by ships in the Antarctic.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Thirdly, from 1 January 2023, the bill will ban ships from applying anti-fouling systems that contain the chemical biocide cybutryne, which is highly toxic to marine organisms.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also includes some minor editorial changes to replace 'orders' with 'marine orders' in both acts to be consistent with the Navigation Act 2012.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important to understand that an Australian-flagged ship is an Australian workplace and, therefore, subject to Australian legislation wherever it is in the world.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These amendments are not expected to have any significant impacts on the Australian maritime industry. Currently Australian-flagged ships that undertake international voyages are unlikely to operate in north European and Arctic waters. However, should they do so, they will be treated the same as any other vessel operating in those areas of the world.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The inclusion of cybutryne as a harmful anti-fouling substance has a transition period consistent with a ship's normal dry-docking cycle for inspections and cleaning. Hence, owners will not incur additional costs from having to take their ships out of service sooner than usual.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="240756" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PASIN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Barker</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:28</span>):  Before I begin, I acknowledge the member for Spence, a former seafarer, given that we are addressing the Maritime Legislation Amendment Bill 2022. The coalition, as does the government, takes Australia's international obligations to protect the marine environment from pollution from ships seriously. The bill aligns Australia's domestic legislation with Australia's international obligations that will support effective and consistent global regulations to protect the marine environment regarding pollution from ships. The International Maritime Organization progressively improves maritime environment pollution standards for ships, and this bill aligns Australia with recent changes to international regulations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill aims to do three things. Firstly, the bill introduces a control for discharges of residues of noxious liquid substances known as persistent floaters—substances like certain grades of vegetable oil or paraffin-like substances that can form surface slicks. Ships will be required to meet new cargo tank cleaning, pre-wash and discharge procedures for persistent floaters. The new regulation applies to northern European waters and comes into effect on 1 January 2023. It specifically applies to north-west European waters, the Baltic Sea, western European waters and the Norwegian Sea.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, the bill bans the use of heavy fuel oils, or HFOs, by ships in Arctic waters from 1 July 2024. A similar plan already is in place for the Antarctic. The ban aims to reduce environmental impacts on sensitive Arctic environments caused by higher emissions of harmful air pollutants from ships burning HFO. The heavy fuel oil ban also reduces the risk of oil spills.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Thirdly, the bill extends controls on ships' harmful antifouling systems to include the chemical biocide cybutryne from 1 January 2023. This chemical is chronically toxic for marine organisms. According to the APVMA, the use of cybutryne as an antifouling agent has never been registered or approved for use by ships in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill brings Australia's regulations in line with the international standards setting body, the International Maritime Organization, which seeks to improve marine environment pollution standards via the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships 1973 and the International Convention on the Control of Harmful Anti-fouling Systems on Ships 2001. While Australian ships are subject to Australian legislation wherever they are in the world, this legislation is not expected to have any significant impacts on the Australian maritime industry. The Australian shipping industry has been consulted on the legislation and is supportive of the alignment of regulations with the international body.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Joint Standing Committee on Treaties has also considered the amendments to MARPOL relating to the cargo residues and tank washing of persistent floating products, to the prohibition on the use and carriage of HFO in Arctic waters and to the HAFS convention relating to the controls of cybutryne. The committee supported the amendments and agreed that binding treaty action could be taken. As such, the opposition will be supporting this bill.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="300129" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BURNELL</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Spence</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:32</span>):  I rise today to give my support to the Maritime Legislation Amendment Bill 2022, after receiving it from the other place. The passage of this legislation may not make it to the front pages of the national broadsheets, but I don't want to be too needlessly pessimistic. Bipartisanship rarely attracts that level of attention.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite this fact, this bill is important. It is deserving of our time to consider it, as I'm sure we all have while waiting to see if or when the House would receive this bill. It's also worthy of support from across this chamber, and we are closing in on doing just that today. It's importance—the need to maintain and look after our oceans—makes perfect sense; as a nation, we are girt by sea. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As those who were present for my first speech would know, I was—a number of years ago—a seafarer out on open waters before continuing my career's journey to election to this place. It is due to this time at sea that I feel especially responsible to ensure that everyone is doing their bit to look after the sea that looks after you. Out there, though, that phrase doesn't always ring as true as you'd like it to.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill brings us in line with our international obligations, which is something that Australia should be taking seriously, to show that we are leaders in this area and model international citizens. Further to that, this takes us one step forward in demonstrating to the world that we take our marine environment seriously and we take the world's marine environment seriously. I'd also like to note the candour of Senator Bragg during the debate in the other place. We've not been early movers in fulfilling our international environmental obligations for quite some time. These obligations are taken seriously by the Albanese Labor government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill amends the Protection of the Sea (Prevention of Pollution from Ships) Act 1983 and the Protection of the Sea (Harmful Anti-fouling Systems) Act 2006 to ensure that Australia is meeting what it has committed to do in line with the International Maritime Organization and its conventions, of which we are a signatory. The first of these international maritime conventions is, namely, the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships, also known as MARPOL. Those that deal with the subject matter on a more regular basis, or if you've been on my staff listening to me talking about the issue passionately over the last couple of weeks, will know Australia is in, in fact, a founding member of the International Maritime Organization, which is a specialised agency of the United Nations. The second of these conventions is the International Convention on the Control of Harmful Anti-fouling Systems in Ships.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Particularly the amendments to the convention on harmful anti-fouling systems on ships outlaw the use of the toxic chemical cybutryne, a substance that my staff in their research discovered is definitely not the home world of the Transformers, which is of course Cybertron! However, their research also uncovered that this substance, according to the Australian Pesticides and Veterinary Medicines Authority, has never been registered or approved for use as an anti-fouling agent for ships in Australia. Anti-fouling agents such as cybutryne are often applied to the hulls of ships to prevent molluscs, barnacles and the like from attaching themselves to those hulls. Whilst it's true the aims of these chemicals are to increase fuel efficiency and improve the performance of vessels, it is the case with these particular substances that the risk of damaging the marine environment and other marine life in the process is unacceptably high. I look forward to these chemicals being phased out in the not-too-distant future. We may not utilise them here, but we must show that we are acting on these changes to the convention so that other countries may follow suit.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also aims to limit the discharge of what are known as persistent floaters. For those of us unfamiliar with the terminology, it refers to slick-forming substances. Certain grades of vegetable oils and paraffin are examples of that. The reason why they are called 'persistent floaters' is that in the event of a discharge or spill into the ocean they can mix with other materials, such as plastic debris, to form a floating crust on the water or sink to later be washed ashore to cause more damage to the environment that has been unfortunate enough to find itself in their path. By strengthening any provision out there that protects our marine environment we will all benefit from a cleaner ocean. This is also achieved by more countries doing the same by ratifying these conventions into their domestic laws in the same way that we are doing here today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We all share custodianship of the ocean. The oceans, after all, do not exist solely for the purpose of trade, cargo and shipping goods across the continents. The oceans also provide a rich canvas for: scientific research; fishing stocks, which provide a cheap, stable form of protein for many across the globe; and tourism, an industry that is worth billions to Australia each year alone.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some stretches of the ocean that are intended to be included in this bill are the pristine waters of the Arctic. We can only hope that they remain this way, and this legislation will help to ensure that. It will do this by banning the use of heavy fuel oils across these waters after 1 July 2024. A similar ban has been in place throughout Antarctic waters since 2011. It is about time we ban heavy fuel oils along both the waters surrounding our north and south poles. That's as it should be. These fuels pose such a significant threat to the marine environment, sticking to surfaces like sea ice or wildlife in the event of a spill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also note that the shipping industry has been aware of these amendments in advance through negotiations at the International Maritime Organization in order to develop these new controls to prevention pollution from ships. In fact, the exposure draft of this bill was published on the website of the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development, Communications and the Arts on 24 August 2022. Ultimately, the exposure draft was met with no strident opposition, just a willingness to engage and see that we are falling into line, effectively, with the vast majority of the world that are signatories to the treaty. If the altruistic urge to preserve our environment was not going to garner the requisite support, I think those reasons above will go a long way towards winning hearts and minds.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also like to thank the previous speaker, the member for Barker, for his contribution—from one South Australian in this place to another. We can achieve great things when in lockstep, and, in that spirit, I thank those senators for their contributions to this debate in the other place on Thursday. For these reasons, I am pleased to commend this bill to the House, and I hope it receives support from all sides of this chamber. </span>

The Australian government is committed to best-practice maritime environmental protection. This bill will bring Australia's maritime legislation in line with the latest globally agreed amendments to international maritime conventions that Australia is a party to. The bill will: further strengthen our marine environment protections by introducing, as I said before, provisions to control the discharge of noxious liquid substances known as persistent floaters in certain European waters that come into force on 1 January 2021; extend the current ban on the use of heavy fuel oil by ships in the Antarctic to encompass Arctic waters from 1 July 2024; and ban the use of ship antifouling systems containing the toxic chemical biocide cybutryne from 1 January 2023. </span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr TUDGE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Aston</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:44</span>):  The purpose of the Higher Education Support Amendment (2022 Measures No. 1) Bill 2022 is to give effect to two changes which were previously introduced by the Morrison government. The first is a substantial initiative for rural, regional and remote Australia, which is to give effect to the coalition's HELP for Rural Doctors and Nurse Practitioners measure announced in the 2021-22 MYEFO. This measure provides a partial or full higher education loan program, known as HELP, debt deduction for rural doctors and nurse practitioners who reside and practise in regional, rural or remote Australia once they complete their studies. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition introduced this measure to encourage doctors and nurse practitioners to relocate to rural and regional Australia by reducing their outstanding HECS-HELP debt. This is a substantial incentive, given that the HECS debt for doctors can be up to $100,000. The need for health professionals across regional and rural Australia is particularly important, though, with around one-third of our population—around eight million people—living in rural, regional and remote areas. It's of great concern that this group of Australians experience poorer health outcomes than those in metropolitan areas. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">According to the OECD <span style="font-style:italic;">Health at</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> a </span><span style="font-style:italic;">g</span><span style="font-style:italic;">lance</span> report in 2017, Australians have one of the highest life expectancies in the world. But when we dig deeper into the data the life expectancy rates between people in metro areas and those in regional and remote areas differ by about five years, with even greater differentials for Indigenous Australians. Much of this is attributed to less access to preventative health services, such as GPs and nurse practitioners. Around 20 per cent of people in regional Australia report not having access to a general practitioner nearby. In fact, around 65,000 Australians have no access to GP services within an hour's drive of their home. Consequentially, they access less care and are at greater risk of death from preventable and treatable conditions, such as diabetes and heart disease. Overall, there's a 20 per cent increase in disease compared to those living in metropolitan areas. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This measure will go a long way to addressing this by providing access to essential health services. We hope that around 850 GPs and nurse practitioners will take up this initiative. The value of debt reduction applied will be guided by where eligible doctors and nurses locate to, using the Modified Monash Model. This model depicts the remoteness of a location on a scale, with category MM 1 representing a major city and category MM 7 representing a very remote location. The locations for this measure will be in the areas of MM 3 to MM 7. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For example, doctors and nurse practitioners who choose to work in a rural or regional area will need to provide a minimum of 24 hours a week of Medicare billed services for a period equivalent to the duration of their whole degree. For doctors, this is usually around eight years. For nurse practitioners, this is around three years. These areas include locations like Dubbo and Lismore in regional New South Wales or Busselton in Western Australia. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Doctors and nurse practitioners who choose a remote area to work in will need to provide a minimum of 24 hours a week of MBS billed services, for a period equivalent to half the duration of their degree, to have their full HECS-HELP debt waived. This would equate to around four years for doctors and 1½ years for nurse practitioners, so these are very substantial incentives. I'll repeat that: a doctor who's graduated goes and works in a remote area for half the duration of their degree—let's say it's an eight-year degree—they do it for four years and they have their entire HECS debt waived. Gone. It's the same for a nurse who does that. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These areas include Alice Springs in the Northern Territory, Mallacoota in my home state of Victoria or Bruny Island in Tasmania. They are real, great incentives for new doctor and nurse graduates to go to these regional and remote areas, and we think they'll have a sizeable impact. That's exactly why we introduced this measure into the parliament at the end of last year. Unfortunately, the parliament was prorogued before the measure could pass. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The measure itself will be backdated as per the coalition announcement in the 2021-22 MYEFO, and eligibility and retrospectivity commence from 1 January 2022. This measure builds on the coalition's significant investment in health, be it through Medicare and high bulkbilling rates, more listings on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, record hospital funding or more mental health services. We will be moving an amendment, and I'm happy to table that amendment. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our amendment seeks a review of the policy, which we would have done in government as a normal part of reviewing new policies. The review seeks to assess the policy's implementation, take-up and effectiveness in filling those particular workforce shortages across regional, rural and remote Australia. But a critical part of the review, which we have in this amendment and which we hope will get the support of this parliament, is to specifically assess other skills shortage areas in those regional and remote areas to see if a similar style of policy could equally be applicable for those skills shortage areas. It might be, for example, in mental health services. It could be engineers, which we often lack in regional or remote areas. Possibly, we can investigate having those HECS waivers for new graduates going into those areas, as well. That's what we're arguing this review should do in our tabled amendment. I urge the government to support this amendment to ensure that we can continue to provide Australians who live in regional, rural and remote areas with the services they need and should have access to.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also changes the definition of a grandfathered student to clarify the grandfathering arrangements under the Job-ready Graduates Package of reforms to higher education, known as the HELP grandfathering measures. These measures meant that, when the job-ready graduates program came into place, most of the fees for students went down or stayed the same. But there were some courses where the fees went up, and these grandfathered arrangements were put in place to ensure that, if you'd already started a degree at a certain price point, that price point would be maintained for the duration of the degree.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This particular amendment ensures that an honours year of study at the end of your degree is also considered to be part of the overall degree, as far as the grandfathering arrangements are concerned, rather than being a new degree which consequently attracts a higher fee rate. It's a very straightforward, clarifying amendment. That was always the intent of the job-ready graduates program, but this will absolutely make sure that those students who started their degree under the lower rates will continue all the way through to the completion of their honours year under that rate, as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend the government and Minister Clare for re-introducing this bill. I particularly commend the government for adopting the coalition's policy—a very good policy which we introduced towards the end of last year—of providing those HECS and HELP waivers for the doctors and nurse practitioners who go and work in the regional and the rural areas. We think it will make a difference. We're confident it'll make a difference. It will make a difference in getting more doctors and nurse practitioners out to more regional and remote areas. In doing so, it will make a difference to the health outcomes of all of those Australians who live in those locations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank the government for reintroducing the coalition's bill. I commend the amendment which we have put down, which will reassess how this is all going after a couple of years and take a look at whether or not any other skills shortage areas should additionally have the benefit of these types of HECS and HELP waivers, applicable through this bill for doctors and nurses. I commend this bill and the amendment.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr GARLAND</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Chisholm</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:53</span>):  This House has heard me on a number of occasions talk passionately about my love of strong health systems, universal health care and a robust higher education sector that provides opportunities to all. I'm really delighted to speak today on a piece of legislation that will deliver great health outcomes and encourage the education of health practitioners in our regions, because that sector matters to Labor and it's clear we have a problem there.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation, the Higher Education Support Amendment (2022 Measures No. 1) Bill 2022, protects students from experiencing unfair financial hits due to the changes to higher education fee structures introduced by the previous government in the Job-ready Graduates Package, in cases where students have already commenced a course or are forced to change courses for a range of reasons out of their control. The legislation also provides a real incentive to doctors and nurse practitioners to work in regional and rural areas, by providing a reduction of 50 or 100 per cent in their HELP debt, the figure depending on the time they spend in an eligible rural, remote or very remote location and on whether the location is rural, remote or very remote.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation ensures that there are grandfathering measures for HECS-HELP arrangements, to ensure that students are not disadvantaged by the Job-ready Graduates Package introduced by the previous government. It's important that, when students are undertaking honours courses, they are not unfairly hit with higher costs due to a change in higher education policy that was introduced after they had begun their course of study. Given I have both Monash and Deakin universities in my electorate, this has the potential to impact many students in Chisholm. It is really important that we protect those students from the financial hit they would suddenly experience if we did not grandfather the HECS-HELP provisions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This measure also protects students who, through absolutely no fault of their own, have had their courses discontinued or restructured or have been forced to change courses by their education provider. It would be unfair to deny these students grandfathering protection, so that is one of the very good reasons we are introducing this legislation. I'm really pleased that the government have recognised this problem in the system and that we are taking this very important step of grandfathering HECS-HELP obligations for students who otherwise would perhaps be unfairly hit with a financial penalty.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Deputy Speaker, we know we are in the midst of a jobs and skills crisis. Indeed, that's why our government made it a priority to host the Jobs and Skills Summit here in Canberra just after we were elected, just over six months ago. I ran a local forum in my beautiful community in Chisholm too. We've heard, through these various fora, about the acute shortage of professionals in the healthcare system and the grim impacts that that is having across communities right around the country. At the recent jobs and skills round table that I hosted in Chisholm, I heard about the importance of general practitioners as the load-bearing scaffolding of the health system. I know this really well. I was raised in a family with a father who was a general practitioner running his own business and doing so much work to support our community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've met with Deacon and Monash universities about this issue, and I'm really grateful for their insights and expertise in this area. Both Professor Christina Mitchell, from the Faculty of Medicine, Nursing and Health Sciences at Monash University, and Professor Iain Martin, Vice-Chancellor of Deakin University, have generously shared with me their valuable thoughts on what we can do to meet our current and future workforce needs. I look forward to continuing to meet with them and listen to their expertise in advocating for evidence based solutions to problems we face as a community and as a country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't know if the House is aware of this, but I was born in Traralgon, and we were living there because my dad, a doctor, and my mum, who was a nurse, had relocated from Melbourne to complete their training and assist with a workforce shortage in the region at the time, working at the local hospital. So there unfortunately have been shortages in our region for some time. It's critical that governments invest to attract to the regions health practitioners, especially GPs and nurse practitioners, who can help relieve some of the pressure experienced in hospitals and emergency departments, which happens when we don't intervene in health issues early. We know that, more often than not, early intervention leads to better outcomes for patients and is better for the economy too.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm really proud to be part of an Australian government that understands the problems facing communities in the regions and wants to provide real solutions—real outcomes for Australians and our communities. I'm really pleased that we're getting on with delivering the policies and solutions we need to build a better future. That's why ensuring that we establish a HELP debt reduction program for rural doctors and nurse practitioners is really important—that is, extending this incentive beyond what was introduced previously and came into effect on 1 January this year. This will ensure updates to outstanding HELP debts processed annually through the taxation system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are investing a significant amount in incentives for eligible doctors and nurse practitioners, and it is really important. This legislation will pay off doctors' and nurse practitioners' loans if they work in these communities, and I think that's a fantastic thing. This will make a difference both to communities and to those who would otherwise be carrying a significant HELP debt, often when they are at the beginning of their working life. The aim here is to attract students to fill the critical shortage of health workers in regional areas, and we've heard the Rural Doctors Association of Australia say that that numbers in the thousands. Eligible doctors and nurse practitioners will be encouraged to live in these areas. This will reduce their HELP debt significantly. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are so many benefits to this for the individuals who are able to utilise this scheme and for our wonderful regional communities. We know that rural GPs are more likely to be able to provide in-hospital care as well as private consulting room care. We know that more GPs in rural areas provide after-hours services. We know that they engage in the public health roles expected of them by their communities where there often may be few doctors to choose from. They can engage in clinical procedures and emergency care. They are able to provide real holistic support to the communities that they serve, and I've seen this firsthand in my own family.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Although my electorate is not a rural area, the Monash medical school students who study in my electorate will more easily be able to choose to practise in remote areas of Victoria and Australia. I've met with some outstanding medical and nursing students at Monash University in Clayton. It is clear they are passionate about the work they do and love learning on the job. This program will give them the chance to practise in remote and regional areas and develop expertise in new communities or will allow them the opportunity to serve communities that they already had ties to before they moved to Melbourne to study.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This means people can start their careers and not have what is sometimes a real financial worry—HELP debt. I know that my parents as young health practitioners benefited from building a community as they were building their careers in Gippsland. When we moved to Melbourne a few years later to be closer to my grandparents I know the experience that they had in regional Victoria was really important for our family. They really got a lot out of being able to develop their skills and contribute their skills to the people who needed them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation does a number of things. I'm really pleased that we've introduced it to the parliament. It importantly protects students from the changes made to higher education fee structures that would have unfairly impacted those who commenced courses prior to its introduction or who were forced to change courses due to the external factors described in the legislation. It provides a real boost to our medical workforce, particularly in regional Australia, which is very dearly needed.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr WEBSTER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mallee</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:02</span>):  I rise to support the Higher Education Support Amendment (2022 Measures No. 1) Bill 2022. It builds on what we on this side of the House know was a good piece of legislation. The original bill introduced by the coalition in the 2021-22 Mid-Year Economic and Fiscal Outlook has been reintroduced and encourages the relocation and retention of eligible doctors and nurse practitioners by reducing their outstanding HECS-HELP debts. This measure also allows for the waiver of indexation on outstanding HELP debts for eligible doctors and nurse practitioners while they are residing in and competing eligible work in rural, remote and very remote areas. HECS-HELP debts for doctors can be up to $100,000. Any reduction in that would certainly be an incentive and enticement for a graduate to move to the country—at least that's my hope in my electorate of Mallee.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Any incentives that boost our regional and rural health workforce are certainly worth pursuing and are supported by this side of the House. In Mallee, as in many regional centres across Australia, access to health care is at crisis point—and I don't say that lightly. This amendment bill will expand this policy beyond the health workforce to other sectors in the future, which would mitigate the dire workforce issues that we face in our regions. We need to ensure that everything possible is done to bolster skilled, unskilled and semiskilled workforces in rural Australia. This is for every industry—be it agriculture, education or manufacturing. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Access to health services is a key issue for people who are considering a tree change. Whether young teachers or older retirees moving to the region, knowing that there is quality health care matters. For parents of a young family who are teachers considering taking jobs at a local school, they're less likely to do so if there are no GPs available to support their family. If we don't ensure country workforces have a sustainable supply of essential services, such as health, these communities will be unsustainable in the long run.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Mildura, in the north-west of Mallee, is an example of a town with a struggling health workforce. Most GPs in town have closed their books to new patients. Some, like my husband, who is a GP, work 60-plus hours a week. In the recent <span style="font-style:italic;">G</span><span style="font-style:italic;">eneral </span><span style="font-style:italic;">P</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ractice</span><span style="font-style:italic;">: health of the nation</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> 2022</span> report, I note he is one of a small number who work those hours. And he is one of the 40 per cent of Australian GPs, or nearly 50 per cent of Victorian GPs, who will retire in the next few years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This dilemma has had terrible outcomes. People leave this pristine area because they cannot find a doctor. This is true not just for Mallee but for towns across Australia. It means hospital emergency departments are overflowing, struggling to manage the number of people who are unable to see their GP. Even worse, people simply stop trying to deal with their health issues and, sadly, that increases the morbidity statistics in the regions. How long can this situation go on?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It highlights the disparity between city and country. Nearly nine million people live in rural areas across Australia, yet these people often experience poorer health outcomes than their city counterparts. This is something that needs to change. It must change. We can change it by ensuring health workforces can meet their communities' needs. Providing incentives to bolster the uptake of not only general practitioners and nurse practitioners in the regions but other essential medical professionals, such as psychologists, psychiatrists or physiotherapists, assists in ensuring that no matter where you live you have access to adequate medical care. Beyond that, through this amendment we can bolster the workforce in other industries.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This amendment calls for a review of this bill in two years time in consultation with the National Rural Health Commissioner and the Regional Education Commissioner. It will provide sufficient time to monitor the implementation of the existing measure for doctors and nurse practitioners. With this knowledge, we can determine other priority areas relevant to rural and remote Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, initially, this bill was a piece of sound legislation introduced by the coalition, and it is pleasing to see it being recognised by this government—that we can do more for the regions. As a proud representative of a regional electorate and a strong advocate for regional and rural Australia as a whole, amending this bill to support other industries is the right way to provide support for all Australians, no matter their postcode.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gilmore</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:08</span>):  I'm incredibly excited today to speak in support of the Higher Education Support Amendment (2022 Measures No. 1) Bill 2022. I am pleased that this bill is helping to support students with fairer grandfathering provisions for job-ready graduates. As a former TAFE teacher, I know how important education is. We need to make sure that our rules are fair and clear. Students shouldn't be lumped with fees that they weren't expecting because our laws aren't clear enough or because their university made decisions to change or cancel their courses. So that is an important change.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But what I'm really excited about with this bill is the new provision to encourage the employment and retention of doctors and nurse practitioners in rural, regional and very remote areas of Australia. This fantastic bill is taking real, innovative action to address the GP shortage we are facing across regional and rural Australia but in particular in my electorate of Gilmore on the New South Wales south coast. What it means is that doctors and nurse practitioners will be incentivised to live and work in regional and rural Australia by having their university debt waived if they stay long enough. It's not just if they come for a short while but if they come for a long while. Medical degrees certainly don't come cheap, but the Albanese government is working to reduce that cost. The only catch—not that I would call it a catch—is that you have to work in regional Australia. As someone who has spent their whole life in regional Australia, I can tell you that is not a bad deal at all. The south coast is the most magnificent place on earth—why wouldn't you want to live and work there?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is truly something to be celebrated, but to really understand why this change is so important, I think it's important to understand the scale of the problem we are facing. I want to talk a little bit about the difficulties local people have had in accessing a doctor. The shortage of doctors in regional and rural Australia has been escalating for years. Local GPs are overworked and struggling to cope in a system that isn't supporting them, with a hospital system that is broken, and with an ageing population that increasingly needs more care and support. The major hospitals in my electorate are in desperate need of upgrades. The Eurobodalla has been waiting for a new hospital for years. We have been fighting to make it a level 4 hospital against a state government that has continually played down the health needs of this community. The Shoalhaven hospital is chronically at the top 10 of a number of lists, but nothing to celebrate—it's top 10 in the state for the longest emergency department wait times and the worst hospital for rostering. Only 46 per cent of its patients have their treatment start on time, and only 47 per cent leave within four hours. The list goes on.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There has been chronic underfunding from Liberal state and federal governments for years and years. The trouble is, it's a negative feedback loop. The fewer GPs, the more pressure on hospitals, and the more pressure on hospitals means more pressure on GPs—a system that can't cope. Local people have to either travel great distances or, in many cases, go without, leading to more serious health complications. We need more GPs. Local doctors in our community have been demanding change for a long time, pointing out, quite rightly, that the incentives for getting GPs in regional areas have just not been fit for purpose.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When I was first elected to parliament in 2019, I joined with many members of the Tuross Head community to raise concerns about the closure of the Queen Street Medical Centre in Tuross Head. The wonderful Tuross Head Progress Association presented me with a five-page submission on the negative impacts this decision would have on the local community, and on the domino effect the closure would have on retail businesses, patients and the broader community. Queen Street Medical Centre has its main centre in Moruya, at the time had satellites in Broulee and Tuross Head. When the local doctor left, they struggled to recruit a new one. There weren't enough incentives or reasons to attract doctors to small places like Tuross Head—hard to imagine, given how beautiful the area is—not to mention the pressures the former government's Medicare cuts were placing on GP practices. We're working on that, too, another big but important task. So, sadly, the Tuross Head practice closed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an ageing population, with more people over 65 than under, but all too often they have to travel great distances for medical care. Now they have to travel just to see their GP. The flow-on also means local people don't use the local pharmacy, stop by the local bakery or grab a coffee from the local cafe. Instead, they do all of this in a larger town, putting even more pressure on the small local Tuross Head shops. These are the flow-on impacts, all from the loss of a doctor. As an ageing population, many also don't drive. This means many people might avoid or delay seeing their doctor, which we know leads to more health complications. It's just simply not good enough.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I along with many others was relieved when in 2020 a doctor from Sydney finally came to the rescue, opening a practice once more in Tuross Head. This doctor could see the huge need in regional communities and was spurred into action after the COVID pandemic. At his own cost, he took a decision that actually didn't make business sense but acted for the good of others. I can tell you that is an attitude we know well on the south coast—a truly selfless community. We welcomed this new doctor with open arms.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly, Tuross Head is not an isolated example. Last year Sanctuary Point lost its last GP because the amazing Dr Kate Manderson, who runs a few centres around Shoalhaven, could not find a doctor to replace the retiring GP there. As many of her GPs retired, she had just been unable to find and recruit new ones. I have met with Dr Kate on many occasions to hear her views on how we can address the issues facing local GPs. She has lots of great ideas, and we are connecting those through to the minister for health, who is very receptive to how we can improve regional and rural access to GPs. I always appreciate the time Dr Kate takes to share her thoughts with me on important local issues. Annette Pham, who runs another set of local practices, also had the same issue at her practice. They have struggled to recruit and keep local doctors. They could see the problems and have so many ideas to fix the issues.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Both Annette and Dr Kate advocated strongly to improve incentives for recruiting and retaining GPs in regional areas like ours. They advocated for years to have the Distribution Priority Area updated for our community, and I joined them in that fight. The former government removed the DPA status of Nowra-Bomaderry and Sussex Inlet three years ago, and the case for undoing that was clear from the start. I advocated strongly to the former minister about this, raising that concern here in the parliament, writing to the minister and begging him to change our status. We were absolutely thrilled to see that change finally happen in February this year—a huge win for our community, a hard-fought win. But it was a long fight, and that one change is not enough to make up for the loss of doctors in our community. A lot of damage was done in that time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Dr Kate and Annette continue to be fierce advocates for how we can address this issue. Together we also managed to advocate for a reintroduction of Medicare item 288, video/telehealth psychiatry consultations, in regional and rural Australia. The former government removed this important bulk-billed service. It was a heartless decision that many local doctors and patients raised concerns with me about. People told me how they had been put into a dark place because they couldn't afford to see their psychiatrist anymore. They could no longer afford to get their prescriptions renewed. They were abandoned by a government who did not understand the healthcare needs of regional Australia. Together with local doctors and patients, our advocacy saw that reinstated by the Albanese government. I was so delighted about that, and many people contacted me to say how relieved they were.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So the voices of local doctors really do make a difference to the policies that we deliver. I was pleased to welcome Annette, her husband, Dr Hao Pham, and other advocates from their service to Parliament House last week to meet with the health minister and continue their advocacy. They want to see more doctors becoming GPs. They want to see bulk-billing increased again after years of cuts. They are fighting for vulnerable people, and our government is listening. I will be welcoming Dr Kate very soon as well so she can share her thoughts on GPs and aged care, because I know their voices are crucial to getting this right. I sincerely thank them and every local doctor, nurse and medical practitioner for their advocacy on these crucial issues.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my time as member for Gilmore, literally hundreds of people have contacted me to say they can't find a GP. People are travelling hours in the wrong direction just to see a doctor or ending up in our already overloaded hospital system. GP access has been spiralling out of control for far too long, made worse by cuts to Medicare and a decade of mismanagement by a Liberal government who wouldn't prioritise access to health care. Fundamentally, they did not believe in Medicare, so I am absolutely delighted that today we are taking one more serious step in the right direction to recruit and keep doctors in our regional communities. Once again I like to think that it is the ideas of our community on the South Coast that have contributed towards this important reform. In my recent Jobs and Skills Summit Survey, conducted in the lead up to the summit in September, many people suggested that removing or reducing education debts for people who work and stay in regional and rural areas was the way to go. Juanita said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Provide subsidies for relocation and providing HECS relief to those who commit to staying and working in rural communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Gina said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… reduce the HECS debt of bonded medical students who come to the regions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">These were two amongst many similar suggestions. Well, Juanita and Gina, that is exactly what this bill will do. If this bill passes, from 1 January next year, eligible doctors and nurse practitioners will have their HELP debts reduced or wiped if they live and work in areas like the South Coast for the equivalent length of their degree. Doctors and nurse practitioners who meet half of the time requirements will be able to access half of the HELP debt removal. This is fantastic news.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Moving to regional and rural Australia is no easy task for someone who has never lived here before, so we need to encourage them, not just for a short time but for a long time. We need to encourage them to put down some roots, build a network of family and friends and live their lives here. Zero HECS debt is a strong incentive for a young doctor or nurse practitioner to try regional Australia, particularly in this economic climate, and I know that in a beautiful area like the South Coast there are more than a few reasons to stay. This is one step in the right direction, one part of a suite of changes we are working on to address our GP crisis across regional Australia. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm delighted that the recent budget is also delivering a Medicare urgent care clinic for the Batemans Bay region. Providing bulk billed medical care in this community will make a huge difference to local people. We hope to see more of these clinics rolled out over time, but I am really pleased that Batemans Bay will be one of the first. The Albanese government is going to continue to work hard to improve health services and health outcomes for regional and rural communities like ours on the New South Wales South Coast. This bill today is so incredibly important. We need to incentivise more doctors into our communities, and I say to any studying doctor or nurse practitioner, if you want a free degree, why not come and live on the sunny South Coast? We have beaches, mountains, valleys, even a rainforest, and we have the best community in Australia. We will welcome you with open arms, so give us a shot. I commend this bill to the House. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is in the midst of a GP crisis, both because the rising cost to see a GP is a barrier to many Australians accessing health care and because of a widespread shortage of GPs across the country. With an ageing GP workforce and not enough new medical students choosing to specialise in general practice, the problem is set to only get worse as GPs retire over the next 10 to 15 years. Only 14 months ago I was working as a GP myself during the COVID pandemic. During this time, we faced not only the COVID-19 pandemic but the increased incidence of eating disorders, mental health issues, addictions and chronic disease management. Our practices also faced the challenges of being used as COVID call centres. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know first-hand the pressures GPs across the country, including in my electorate, are under. I've spoken to many practices on the brink of financial collapse, a position supported by research conducted by the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners which shows 48 per cent of GP practices are in the same position. Very few GP practices in my electorate offer comprehensive bulk billing to all their patients. Many have had job ads up for months and can't fill GP positions. This parliament is on notice that we are facing a breakdown of Australia's primary healthcare a system. It is now an emergency and in need of intensive care. Currently, the situation is worse in our rural areas where people are waiting months to see a doctor. The doctor they eventually see is working up to 80 hours a week, day in, day out, to cope with the demand. We desperately need more doctors and nurse practitioners in rural and remote areas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I welcome this bill which seeks, amongst other measures, to incentivise doctors and nurse practitioners to move to and service rural and remote areas in exchange for eliminating or reducing the higher education loan repayment debt. I also note that this measure was recommended by the Royal Australian College of GPs, the Australian Medical Association and the Australian College of Rural and Remote Medicine. However, there is no definitive evidence that reducing or eliminating the HELP debt will drive an increase in the numbers of GPs working in these areas of need. Firstly, the financial benefit conferred by this bill may be substantially offset by the lower wages received in those areas compared to metropolitan and urban areas. Secondly, there is a concern that the incentive may become an ineffective bonus if it is given to people who intended to move back to rural regions anyway. The government's modelling suggests that this measure will help 850 doctors and nurse practitioners move to regional and rural areas per year. If that number is correct and it does consist of medical practitioners who would not otherwise have moved to rural and remote areas, then it is good policy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite welcoming this measure, I must acknowledge that this is the equivalent to placing a bandaid on a gaping arterial wound. The GP crisis is not a rural and remote one only; it is a crisis that impacts every electorate across Australia. In order to assess the success of this policy, we need to track and review it; however, in this legislation there's no planned review, and this is concerning. Good policy and governance depends upon evidence of effectiveness and success, particularly when the benefits are conferred upon individuals. We have had schemes like this before, but, due to a lack of evaluation and evidence, we are unsure of their benefit. We need to evaluate this initiative to determine its effect.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This measure shouldn't stand alone. We know that changes to general practice need to be comprehensive. The Australian Medical Association has an 18-point plan for supporting equal access to health care for rural communities. It includes measures to drive the rural medical training pipeline, such as by delivering a strong rural training pathway, and measures for retaining existing medical practitioners. The Royal Australian College of General Practitioners has a targeted investment plan to support patient access to general practice care.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2021, the Senate Community Affairs References Committee commenced an inquiry into the provision of general practitioner and related primary health services to outer metropolitan, rural and regional Australians. They released an interim report but never a final report, noting that there was merit in having the matter re-referred to the committee under the 47th Parliament. The interim report that was issued under that inquiry was extensive; it made recommendations that mirror the calls from professional bodies such as the AMA and the RACGP.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In early October of this year, the RACGP also convened a GP crisis summit here in Canberra with GP groups from around the country. Again, recommendations from that summit called for greater investment in and planning and reform of general practice. Those recommendations are not piecemeal, stand-alone measures, nor are the ones called for by professional bodies. They call for structural reform and a multifaceted approach to address the GP crisis and reverse the falling trajectory of new GPs entering the workforce. Today, only 13.8 per cent of medical students are choosing general practice as their specialty. We need to get that back to 50 per cent. Today, we face a year-on-year decline of GPs, with a 15 per cent decline in urban areas and a 27 per cent decline in rural areas. This is coupled with almost doubled demand. We are on track for a GP deficit of over 11,000 GPs by 2032. These figures are incredibly concerning, and GPs in my electorate are already feeling the impacts of doctor shortages, as are all GPs around the country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The outcomes of the recent GP summit are clear. The pool of GPs must be increased. Reinstating GP rotations for junior doctors will help increase the number of junior doctors who choose to specialise in general practice. It is also necessary to reduce the red tape for international medical graduates to be able to participate in general practice. We need to ensure that general practice is a sustainable career path by introducing measures to, for example, increase the Medicare rebate and bulk-billing incentives, and to support GPs to spend more time with patients, which will, of course, also deliver better patient health outcomes. We also need to strengthen the role of GP team members, including nurse practitioners, practice nurses and allied health.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians have endured the COVID-19 pandemic and experienced the impact of a healthcare system in crisis. They have seen what happens when we fail to take the risks to the system seriously enough to plan and mitigate. We can't make the same mistakes again.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week many MPs were visited by passionate and dedicated GPs who shared their experience of the GP crisis and called for it to be urgently addressed. I thank the Parliamentary Friends of General Practice, of which I am a co-chair, and the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners for organising this initiative. I also appreciate the minister for health's acknowledgement that general practice is indeed in crisis, describing the low number of medical graduates applying to specialise in general practice as the most terrifying statistic in health care.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I now call on the government to prioritise this reform, plan for it in the May budget and, at minimum, deliver recommendation 6 of the Community Affairs References Committee's general practice interim report to substantially increase the Medicare rebates for all levels of general practice. I commend this bill to the House.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms TINK</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">North Sydney</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:30</span>):  I want to thank the member for Mackellar for moving this very important amendment that we have in front of us at the moment. The reality is that our healthcare system is in crisis. Whether it's in the hospital system or through to the community system, what we know without a doubt is that there are plenty of people who are looking for healthcare services and, sadly, are unable to access them. I was fortunate to be one of the members of parliament who was visited last week by people who were representing the GP workforce across this country, and I was horrified to learn that of the students who finish medicine these days at university just under 14 per cent of them are choosing to go into general practice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As somebody who grew up in regional and rural Australia, where the general practitioners in our community were considered to be amongst the highest of the citizens that we had, it's heartbreaking to see that medical students are not choosing to lean into this pathway as a career going forward. There is no doubt that as our population ages we are going to need general practitioners who have an ability to look at a person and see them as an entire health puzzle. There is no doubt in many medical situations that having a good relationship with a general practitioner actually enables your health to be managed more effectively. As someone who has advocated very loudly in the area of mental health, I think this is particularly important.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To this end, I commend the member for Mackellar and agree with her that we do need to recognise that the financial benefits currently being offered under the Higher Education Support Amendment (2022 Measures No. 1) Bill 2022 in many cases will not be sufficient to drive what we need to see—a significant influx of talent into this professional area. I also want to reiterate the member for Mackellar's call that we are going to be 11,000 GPs short by 2032. Knowing that there are so many other industries across our nation who are also seeking talent, it's imperative that we move as quickly as we can to find these resources and close this gap. I understand from both the member from Mackellar and those who visited me last week that GP training is something that needs to be included in the fundamental training program of healthcare professionals, and I would encourage the federal government to step into that to exert pressure where they can.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also ultimately recognise that there's been minimal movement on Medicare rebate, which makes it very difficult for general practitioners to provide the level of support that their patients are ultimately expecting from them. You cannot take care of the health of a whole human being when your business model forces you to try and get through as many people as you can by focusing on a five-minute consultation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to fundamentally embrace the knowledge of members such as the member for Mackellar and the others who make representations in this chamber to ensure that we are building a healthcare system that is not just fit for purpose now but fit for purpose well into the future. I commend the member for Mackellar's amendment to the House.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr ANANDA-RAJAH</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Higgins</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:34</span>):  From Coffs Harbour to Orange, Gladstone, Bunbury, Rockingham, Burnie, Armidale in New England, Katherine, Darwin, Geelong and Warrnambool, my medical degree served as a ticket to travel and experience the joys of working and living in regional Australia. I loved my time in these communities. People were genuine and so grateful to have a doctor, often travelling long distances to seek help. The medicine was great. It sharpened my skills because, with limited diagnostics or specialist support, diagnosis came down to your smarts. I learned to study faces, bodies or the quiver of a voice for clues. Was that tinge of yellow a liver problem, the ruddiness of the face a problem with drinking or a lung cancer, listlessness the sign of an underactive thyroid or the fluid around ankles a sign of protein loss through the kidneys? Could a loss of sensation in the legs be due to spinal cord compression? A chronic cough with weight loss in an elderly person with X-ray changes might have been reactivating tuberculosis or swollen glands under the armpits a sign of lymphoma. Young farmers with dislocated shoulders or arms swollen from a fracture sat stoically, waiting to be seen after having sometimes driven themselves miles to get to hospital.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Perhaps most fulfilling was the continuity of care. My mentors in these places got to know their patients over years and decades. They were wedded to them. Aside from the patients, there was an unmistakable sense of community. As junior doctors, we were invited to colleagues' homes for barbecues. The practice nurses looked out for me, like procuring a bike to help me get around town. Everyone knew who I was. The anonymity of a big city was replaced with the warmth of care. Importantly, I never felt unsupported. Specialist help from a city hospital was always only a phone call away.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite all these attributes, I ended up, like so many graduates, back in the big smoke. It is an enduring regret that I was not more deliberative in my choice of practice. My internship was at a big city hospital, and once I got on that treadmill I never got off. I also incurred a big HECS debt which took around a decade to pay off.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My story is, sadly, the norm rather than the exception and partly explains the unequal distribution of clinicians, with an excess seen in metropolitan areas compared to a scarcity in the regions. Analysis by the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare in 2020 showed that there were more than 386,000 full-time-equivalent clinicians working in major cities, compared to 132,000 in all other regional and remote areas combined. The Medical Deans Australia and New Zealand survey of 2021 found that among final year students just under a third considered working outside of a capital city. I despaired that at a major hospital I worked at I could count on one hand, over my 13 years there, the number of junior doctors who ended up in general practice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is heartening, then, that we are at least doing something about this. Our amendments to the Higher Education Support Act will reduce or waive HELP debt for rural doctors and nurse practitioners to encourage them to live and work in the regions. Eligibility commences from 1 January this year, retrospective, with applicants required to work at least 24 hours per week. In order to have 100 per cent of the relevant HELP debt forgiven, those in remote and very remote communities are required to work for half the length of the course. Those in small, medium or large rural towns are required to work for the full length of the course. So, Dr Sheridan, who is three years or more post graduation, will be eligible for 100 per cent of HELP debt forgiveness if he works three years—that is, for half of his six-year medical degree—in a remote community like Cloncurry. If he works in a small, medium or large town, like Wangaratta, forgiveness of his HELP debt would occur after working for a minimum of six years or the equivalent of his degree.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The classification of rural and remote locations is based on the Modified Monash Model. It is expected to help around 850 doctors per year. HELP forgiveness could equate to a benefit of approximately $46,000 to $68,000 for students who studied medicine and around $8,000 for nurse practitioners, based on 2022 student contribution amounts. This bill will also waive indexation on HELP debts for the time spent working in a regional or remote area. Refunds will occur through the taxation system after the 50 per cent or 100 per cent work milestones have been met. In 2018-19, those who studied medicine were estimated to take, on average, 10.5 years to repay their HELP debt—much like I did. It's the longest repayment time of any field. Those who studied nursing repaid their debt in an average of 7.7 years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Outside the remit of the Higher Education Support Amendment (2022 Measures No. 1) Bill 2022 are other initiatives to support the regional health workforce. We know that financial incentives are often not enough, which is why we are investing in a mentorship program. We are expanding the prevocational doctor training program to 1,000 places by 2026 through a $5.6 million investment so that more junior doctors have an opportunity to experience rural primary care at an early stage of their career. This is part of the $185 million workforce package to attract more doctors, nurses and allied health professionals into the regions. We all need good mentors—wise heads with grey hair who have seen it all before and are generous with their time—and there is no shortage of them in regional communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to correcting the maldistribution of health professionals, every little nudge helps. When cost-of-living pressures are biting, it makes a real difference for doctors and nurses to consider moving to the country. I wish I had joined the docs all those years ago. My advice to juniors is: don't be seduced by the city when wide-open spaces with a great lifestyle and a fulfilling career beckon. I commend this bill to the House.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr KATTER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kennedy</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:40</span>):  The previous speaker referred to Cloncurry, which, of course, is my home town. It was my father's home town and my grandfather's home town. My father and his two brothers were the three Katter boys; there were three boys in the family. My uncle Norman died from an injury in rugby league. This was before the Second World War. The Qantas plane was in Longreach. If it had been in Cloncurry, they could have flown him out of Cloncurry and straight to Brisbane. But, by the time it came back from Longreach to Cloncurry and then went to Brisbane, he had died. He died as a result of the tyranny of distance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In a terrible piece of irony, my father, who had cancer, was supposed to go down for an operation, and the airline strike hit. Even though the government supplied Air Force planes to ferry people—after three or four months, I think it was—he stood in the queue. He didn't feel it was his right to jump the queue. So it ended up that he got down for the operation some seven or eight months after he should have, and the cancer had gotten away and he died. So two of the three Katter boys died as a result of the tyranny of distance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's a shortage of doctors in the country areas. The previous speaker made mention of the fact that they don't realise the opportunities in country centres. If you drive into Charleville, there's a huge statue to Dr Louis Ariotti, whom people in Charleville and the area considered next to a sainthood. If you drive into Cloncurry, you drive in on Harvey Sutton highway, which is a tribute to the great doctor that lived in our community and saved so many of our lives. I'm sure that they'll have one to Dr Murphy in Longreach in the not-too-distant future! These men were not only leaders who set a wonderful example for their communities; they were great and committed doctors. They didn't just treat you when you came in to be treated; they alleviated your misery and pain and did everything humanly possible to ward off death in these areas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the early days of Qantas, there were many lives lost. Whilst they say Qantas has never had an accident—and that's true of the modern Qantas—the original Queensland and Northern Territory Aerial Services, as it then was, had many deaths. But the effort to overcome the tyranny of distance was so great that people took those risks. You can reflect upon the fact that Ernest Henry, the founder of my home town of Cloncurry, found some heavy rocks there when he was prospecting on horseback, and he rode off to Rockhampton to get them assayed because he thought they were very valuable copper. It turned out they were worthless iron ore, and it had taken him seven months to ride to Rockhampton, get the assays done and go back to Cloncurry. That's the tyranny of distance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My father mentioned on many, many occasions the great Reverend Flynn, who's on one of our banknotes. He brought the mantle of safety to bush with the Royal Flying Doctor Service.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To turn to the present day, for the first time in my life there was no doctor in Julia Creek, there was no doctor in Cardwell and there was no doctor at Mission Beach. Heavens, how could you not find a doctor at Mission Beach! For two years in a row it was voted one of the four most beautiful places on earth. If you go into my offices, as you have on many occasions, Acting Deputy Speaker Vasta—I call them the Mission Beach mafia because most of them come from Mission Beach. You can't get a doctor to go to Mission Beach? There is something seriously wrong out there.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to pay very great tribute to my own doctor, Dr Rod Catton, at Innisfail. I want to pay great tribute to Dr Grant Manypenny, who has worked 70- and 80-hour weeks, continuously, in the latter years of his life to provide us with a vital private medical service in Mareeba. You could say, 'You can go to the hospital,' but you can only go to the hospital for emergencies now. Outpatients at hospitals in Queensland have ceased to exist. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The great 'Red Ted' Theodore, the most important person in Australian history—not my words; they're the words of Paul Keating and Malcolm Fraser—introduced the free hospital system in Queensland. For my entire lifetime, until the ALP got elected in 1990, you could walk in off the street, any time of the day or night, even Christmas Day, 24 hours a day and get service in an outpatients department. Outpatients does not formally exist in Queensland. If you want a graphic illustration of that, my now home town of Charters Towers has a huge sign at the outpatients department saying 'Closed'. On the other side of the aisle is the inpatients department, and that is open. Outpatients is closed permanently. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Lisa Fraser is a very young doctor filled with the enthusiasm of youth and gifted with an excellent intellect. Grant Manypenny has been desperately trying to retire. Rod Catton has worked well after the time he should have stopped working, and we pay great tribute to Rod's self-sacrifice. The three of them came to Canberra. They asked for four things and got all four things. I'm still in a state of shock over it. I've never seen anything like it in my life. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The first thing they asked for that day was the writing off of the HECS debt. The second thing they asked for was more money for GPs in private medical centres. The third thing was foreign doctors coming into Queensland. The restrictions were just a little bit too strict in Queensland and they asked for a liberalisation. The federal government put a second body in that could authorise doctors to become GPs in Queensland. So they're three of the four items. I'm having enormous difficulty remembering the fourth item, and I feel very embarrassed that I can't remember it. I'm at a loss to remember what it was. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was an extraordinary achievement by those three practitioners. They came down at their own expense and lost a lot of money that they would have earned if they'd been up in their own home towns during that period. The time and research they put into those representations was extraordinary. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Quite frankly, there is no answer to this problem. You can give them all the money in the world, every concession in the world that you want to get them, but unless, to become a doctor practising in Queensland, you have to do rural service, nothing short of that is going to overcome this problem. It is a matter of forcing them to do it. You want to become a doctor in Queensland? You have to spend some time in a maybe not so salubrious centre. That was the law in Queensland for as long as we were in government in the state of Queensland—up until 1990, when the ALP took over. They changed that arrangement and now we haven't got doctors. They got rid of the outpatients.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You can spend hundreds of millions of dollars in the state of Queensland or tens of billions of dollars solving the world's planetary problems with respect to the atmosphere and what they call climate change, but people don't realise that there's not enough money to go round. That is something that has never occurred to what we used to call socialist governments. You could hardly call the Queensland government a socialist government—it's anything but. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">People don't understand this. They think that the ALP is representing the have-nots. The complete opposite is true. They slither out of a university into a trade union office, where they are given their proper job of answering the telephone—they're not worth anything more than answering the telephone. But in answering the telephone they get to know all the delegates in Queensland and, when positions come up, they get elected to those positions. They are very articulate and slither in their slippery suits from Sydney universities. Of course they become the owners of Australia. The superannuation funds invest $170 billion every year in the Australian economy, so they are the haves; they are the ruling class; they are the ownership class. They are not very nice people.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What has this got to do with doctors? I'm trying to explain that in Queensland you thought that by electing an ALP government you were going to get looked after. Now your outpatients are closed and towns all over Queensland are without any doctors. The whole system is collapsing underneath you, because there's no money being put there. We're too busy saving the planet. I don't know that it's a very significant contribution there either, with the only proposal coming forward in this House and the state parliament in Queensland is putting windmills in the ocean. I don't think any of you would be game to walk into a hotel and say, 'We're going to solve the world's climate problems because we're going to put windmills in the ocean.' Yet you're game to say it in here; you're game to impose that upon us.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a choice: you can spend money on your fantasies and things that you think will get you re-elected or you can look after the people. I'm proud to say that, for my entire time in the state parliament in Queensland, you could go to the hospital—24 hours a day every day of the year, including Christmas Day—and be attended to by a doctor and a qualified person and every single town in the Kennedy electorate—and there are 120, but you could argue there are 142, depending on your definition—had a resident doctor. That is not now the case. I don't know how many towns are not being serviced now because the doctors are simply not there.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I had the great honour and privilege of calling the first meeting to try to secure a medical school in Townsville. Seven years later, the committee that was formed that day broke through and got the first medical school. I take some considerable pride and congratulate myself on that wonderful achievement. Kudos was given to my daughter Mary Jane Streeton, as she is now, who had been the secretary to the organisation; to Professor Wronski, who was the driving force at all times; and to Lady Pearl Logan, who was an incredible woman—I think the greatest woman of the last century in Australia. She was a lady, a knight of the realm, and had an honorary doctorate from the university. Every day of her life she used to take out her Gospels and read to us. She was a very deeply committed Christian. She was a very devout Presbyterian. Those three people enabled us to get the first medical school built in 44 years in Australia. I am told that some 18 universities have now walked through the door that those three great heroes opened for us.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The irony of this—and it gives me no joy to say this—is that in spite of 200 doctors a year coming out of the Townsville University, and in spite of incredible efforts by Professor Ronski and the dean of the faculty, who are doing everything humanly possible to get those doctors to service the regional centres, we still can't supply the doctors to these places. You can offer half a million dollars a year on top of what they're getting, and I still don't think you're going to get them to go there until you make it compulsory that they go there before they can practice as a GP.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr STEVENS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Sturt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:55</span>):  I rise to support the second reading of the Higher Education Support Amendment (2022 Measures No. 1) Bill 2022, which has two elements—both former measures from the previous government—the second one of which has been the focus of people's contributions for ways in which we can better support young students to take up opportunities in regional and remote settings. This bill provides a significant incentive through dramatic relief to student loans—in fact, the complete extinguishment of them up to a certain amount, depending on where you go and how long you go for.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a good example of a debate on a topic that we don't discuss that regularly in this chamber. I absolutely love Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane, our three great metropolises. The three of them combined are home to the vast majority of people that sit in this chamber. If you take the greater urban areas of those three centres, they house the vast, vast majority of the population of this country. When we're discussing national policy, sometimes it is important to think about whether or not there are different opportunities and different forces at play in our economy and our society depending on whether you're in those three mega urban areas or somewhere else.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am from the City of Adelaide—not a remote or regional area but a city of about 1.3 million people and second biggest urban area, after Perth, following those three mega areas. The state of South Australia is really a city state, so we have only about another 300,000 people in the state that don't live in urban Adelaide. If you got a compass on a map, set it to 100 kilometres and drew a circle around Adelaide from the GPO, you'd capture almost the entirety of the population of South Australia. Even though France and Germany could very easily fit within the boundaries of the state of South Australia, outside of that 100-kilometre radius from the City of Adelaide, we are a very sparsely populated state. Even though the challenges that this part of the bill is targeted to don't necessarily relate to the delivery of services my electorate, it's a bill that's extremely important to my state and to any Australian that cares about all Australians getting proper equity of access to services not just in health but across all services.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In this case, we're talking about health. The issue with the way in which our population is distributed is that in areas like health—and other areas like migration—we have a situation where those three major urban areas tend to be the magnets that attract people from a wide variety of points of view. The economies of scale in the big cities, particularly the cultural ones, lead many people to decide that, if they have the choice, they'd prefer to choose the life in the big cities than the other options available to them. I know that people who sit in this chamber who represent communities that aren't in the big cities very proudly dispute the enjoyment of life in smaller communities being less than in bigger ones, and I think they've got a lot of credibility in what they say. But that is invariably the reality of the challenge that we seek to address.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Previous speakers who represent electorates with regional and remote communities have talked about the personal impact of struggling to attract general practitioners and other medical practitioners to their communities. The member for Kennedy obviously talked about some direct impacts on his family. It's obviously quite tragic and very regrettable that, in his view, which I'm sure is accurate, the tyranny of distance for medical services led to the premature death of two of his family members.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I lived for a couple of years as a child on Norfolk Island. That is an extremely remote place to live. It wasn't very difficult to get a GP to do a couple of years posting on Norfolk Island for reasons that I believe I shouldn't need to outline. Nonetheless, we had that one GP on the island for a population of about 2,000 people in the South Pacific. In the 1980s there was not an aircraft sitting there on the airstrip waiting to medevac people to any other care facilities at the drop of a hat. So the GP there was obviously very much the guardian of life-or-death medical emergency issues. At least back then, we had a small hospital capability but obviously not one much beyond emergency issues. The general practitioner was really just working absolutely full time. If something happened in the middle of the night and you needed medical assistance then she got the call. So it's difficult. I know we have some medical professionals in the room. Being on call permanently means you don't get to enjoy a glass of red wine on Saturday night at a dinner party because at any point you could be called and asked to provide some assistance. For me, as a young boy of five, six and seven, my very first memories of a country GP were of what dedicated service they give to the community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is regrettable that we find ourselves in the challenging circumstance in the 2020s where it is becoming more and more difficult to attract people across a variety of allied health professions but particularly GPs in a permanent way to regional towns. My colleague the member for Grey very regularly raises this issue in this chamber. I absolutely defer to his experiences in his electorate. He represents the vast majority of the state of South Australia, where I am from. I know they have ongoing significant challenges all the time with attracting GPs to certain towns in his electorate, including his home town of Kimba. That has been quite a challenge in recent times.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is one measure that we can pursue to make it more appealing, through the forgiveness of student loans, for more younger people to take up the opportunity of working in regional areas. Apart from the service that they might give in that community, it might take three to six years to qualify for the complete eradication of their student loan. We also hope that in that three or six years they fall in love with the community that they have gone to work in. I think that's a very reasonable expectation. That will probably happen in many circumstances. Certainly, that's the ultimate outcome—that someone goes to a regional community to be their GP for a few years, supported through this scheme. It might make the difference between taking that opportunity and not. Hopefully, it's not three years. Hopefully, it's 20 or 30 years because they find that they have fallen in love with the community and the lifestyle and they see that community as somewhere for them to make a future with their family. That's the hope of the main measure in schedule 2 of this bill, and certainly it's something that we intend to put in place in government. It's not a silver bullet. It's not by any means going to exclusively solve the challenges—far from it. But I think solving the challenge of these workforce shortages is going to mean multiple measures, of which this can be one of many, that come together to make sure that we are doing all that we can to provide the very best of health services to every Australian. Every Australian deserves equity of access to all services that government provides, but none are more important than access to the highest standard of health care. With those comments, I certainly commend the bill to the chamber and look forward to the passage of this legislation so the benefits of it can start to be felt in regional and remote communities in this country as soon as possible.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr YOUNG</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Longman</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:05</span>):  I'm pleased to rise to speak on the Higher Education Support Amendment (2022 Measures No. 1) Bill 2022. The reason I am so pleased to speak on this bill is that it finalises the bill which was first introduced by the coalition in the last term. Unfortunately, due to the election, the previous bill lapsed. I'm pleased the current government has acknowledged its value, and it will hopefully be passed in the near future. It will achieve great outcomes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the greatest challenges facing rural and remote regions in our country is an inability to attract and recruit professional people such as GPs, nurse practitioners and teachers to those communities. This means our people in the country, including many of our Indigenous citizens, are not receiving the care that they need. The coalition identified this issue, and a policy was formulated to address this via means of financial incentives. This bill will mean that doctors and nurse practitioners that make the decision to relocate to regional or rural areas with a Modified Monash, or MM, rating of MM 3 or higher will have their university HECS-HELP debt either reduced or completely waived depending on the Modified Monash rating of the community where they provide the service.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that when people are exposed to these remote and regional locations a percentage of them will make the decision to permanently settle there. Some will fall in love with the town, the community. They may find their future spouse and start a family there. Whatever the reason, this would not happen unless they first moved there. This bill encourages them to do just that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For those GPs and nurse practitioners who choose to return to their original places of residence, their communities will also benefit as just about every community across our nation is screaming out for more GPs. So everyone's a winner. The community then benefits by having a resident health practitioner looking after their health needs, which is very important, as the data tells us that individuals living in regional Australia experience poorer health outcomes than their city counterparts. This is attributed to the fact that they have less access to healthcare professionals. The added bonus is that these communities will have new residents that will contribute to the local economy. Another benefit is that students contemplating which degree to pursue may choose to select medicine or nursing, knowing that their university tuition will be heavily or fully funded.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill also rectifies the anomaly around grandfathering arrangements under the job-ready program to ensure that honours students remain eligible for the grandfathering arrangements where their course started pre 2021. This was another coalition initiative in the last term of government and, again, I'm pleased that this government has continued to run with it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To be eligible for this program, doctors and nurse practitioners will need to work in a community with a Modified Monash rating between MM 3 and MM 7. They will need to provide a minimum of 24 hours a week of MBS billed services for a period equivalent to the duration of a full degree. The other great news is the measure will be backdated as per the coalition's announcement in the 2021-22 MYEFO, and eligibility will retrospectively commence from 1 January 2022.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The HECS-HELP debt for doctors can be up to $100,000. According to the AIHW report <span style="font-style:italic;">Australia’s health 2022</span><span style="font-style:italic;">,</span> GPs living in regional Australia experience greater job satisfaction than those living in urban areas—another great reason to make the move. This bill will hopefully help address the issue of only one in seven graduates in medicine choosing the path of general practitioner. If this issue is not addressed and rectified, then we will continue to see greater load put on our already struggling and overloaded emergency departments or, even worse, people simply won't bother to seek medical treatment at all, which will lead to poorer health outcomes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In speaking to people in my electorate of Longman, there is a great appetite to see the return of the family GP, where your local doctor looked after you and your family's health needs, sometimes for generations. Many people are tired of using the public system and the larger corporates, where they often don't see the same doctor twice. This bill will hopefully go some way in returning to this method of health care. I look forward to seeing the outcomes of this bill, and, if successful, I would like to see it implemented in other demand vocations, such as teaching, for regional communities. This is a good practical bill—first developed by the coalition—that delivers numerous benefits. I commend the bill to the House. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Indi</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:11</span>):  I'm very pleased to rise in support of the Higher Education Support Amendment (2022 Measures No. 1) Bill 2022. This bill aims to encourage the employment and retention of doctors and nurse practitioners in rural, remote or very remote areas of Australia by reducing all or part of their outstanding university HELP debt. I'd like to pay tribute to the member for Lyne, who was very much an architect of this work in the previous government, and likewise the member for Mallee, who's been a very strong supporter of nurse practitioners.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's well known that across Australia we have a shortage of health professionals, but rural areas are disproportionately suffering from this shortage, and we know this has been a longstanding challenge. Our higher prevalence of chronic disease, including asthma, diabetes, cardiovascular disease and cancer, is higher than that of metropolitan centres. This is a chicken-and-egg situation, where we have less early intervention for chronic diseases driving greater and greater demand for health professionals. Doctor-patient ratios are twice as high in remote regions as they are in our cities. Patients simply can't get in the door, and our doctors, nurses and allied health professionals are under enormous pressure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This isn't a recent phenomenon, and, over the years, successive governments have introduced programs such as the departments of rural health and the Rural Health Multidisciplinary Training program to train doctors, nurses and allied health professionals in rural areas. I spent over a decade working at the University of Melbourne department of rural health and experienced the great satisfaction of seeing our students graduate and take up roles as rural doctors in local communities, where they're leading incredibly fulfilling careers and making such a difference to those local people. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's plenty of evidence to show the success of these programs. However, we know that the strongest evidence for attracting and retaining doctors in rural areas is in recruiting young people with a rural origin to enter the medical field. There are some structural barriers for rural students choosing a career in health care, one of which is the cost of education, which goes to the object of this legislation. Additionally, there's the cost associated with leaving home, both from a financial perspective and also from a social perspective. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Programs established under the previous government, such as the Murray-Darling medical program, go to this issue. This program—set up by the previous government, and for which I congratulate them—provides medical training in the regions for students who are from the regions. The network includes La Trobe University in Wodonga—part of my electorate of Indi—where they undertake undergraduate studies in biomedicine before students go on to the Doctor of Medicine program run by the University of Melbourne's department of rural health, based in Shepparton.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When I met with participants in the program earlier this year, I was struck by their stories of why they wanted to be doctors and why they specifically wanted to be doctors in regional and rural communities. Growing up rurally, they told me, they had experienced health struggles in their own families and long hours in the car to go to and from medical appointments in major cities. They spoke of the difficulties and hardships that this created, and it galvanised their resolve to become rural doctors. The students told me how much better it was to be able to attend university and stay living on their home farm, indeed, in their local town. The students I spoke to came from small towns like Milawa and medium sized towns like Wangaratta, Benalla and Wodonga. They were all studying locally at La Trobe University's Wodonga campus. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The program at Latrobe is led by Dr Cathryn Hogarth, who told me there'd been hundreds upon hundreds of applications from students who could have been accepted into the program. They had the marks, they had the aptitude, but the university simply isn't funded for the places. It has the teachers, it has the facilities, including wet labs, and, as I've just indicated, it truly has the demand from young people wishing to study rural medicine. But there are just 15 places in that program at La Trobe each year. The university told me they could take three times as many students, so I would say here is a real opportunity for the Albanese government to expand programs like this with proven models to further increase the number of doctors studying and working in regional Australia. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I support this bill as a measure to get more much needed doctors and nurse practitioners into rural and remote Australia, and importantly encourage them to stay. We need them at the disease prevention end, and we need them at the treatment end—basically, we need them. Health professionals, though, are team players. They must be, and that's why I'm encouraged that this program includes nurse practitioners as well as doctors because, compared to other countries, we have completely underutilised nurse practitioners in Australia, so this bill is a very important endorsement of their skills and their contribution and, more importantly, their potential to do much, much more. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Nurse practitioners are highly trained. They bring years of clinical experience and expertise. They have masters-level specialist education. They can diagnose, prescribe and undertake early intervention and they often work in very hard areas of concern—areas which are hard to reach and very poorly resourced such as aged care, palliative care, wound care, drug and alcohol treatment. But their practice has been hamstrung for years by very poor and inadequate Medicare rebates. This desperately needs reform to unleash their skill in what are really very, very stretched areas of primary care. Again, I call on the Albanese government to address this issue as well, Medicare rebates for nurse practitioners. This is truly an opportunity that we could grasp if we had the will to do so. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislation is as yet untested in the field, so crucially, as this program rolls out, we must monitor its progress. Therefore, I support the member for Mackellar's amendment to review the scheme in 2026 and again in 2029. A review of this bill will help us see how well the scheme is working to attract and retain doctors and nurse practitioners in rural Australia and, really importantly, how it can be improved. I'm pleased to hear that the government will support this amendment, and I hope they consider any recommendations made by the reviews. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to pay attention, importantly, to what's missing in this bill, and what's missing is a kindred program for mental health professionals. One of the biggest challenges facing rural and regional Australia and my constituents in Indi is accessing appropriate, timely mental health support. We had a problem before the pandemic, but now that need is truly and greatly exacerbated not just in the high-prevalence issues of anxiety and depression but also in the very traumatic area of eating disorders where access to evidence based care and help is under enormous strain in the cities but nigh on impossible to access in most rural areas. Local psychologists in Wodonga tell me they simply cannot cope with the demand for their services for eating disorders. They tell me that they need to clone themselves. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While I support the government's measures to increase the rural health workforce through this bill, this is incomplete unless and until we do the same for our rural mental health workforce. I speak in support of this bill, but I believe we need to do more, and that's because of what I see every day in my community, what I hear from my constituents and what I know from my many years of experience as a clinician and researcher in rural health. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I support the government's budget initiatives to address mental health, including the commitment in the budget to restore the 50 per cent loading for telehealth psychiatry services in regional and rural areas. Telehealth psychiatric services were an especially important service to people in regional and rural areas before, and during, the pandemic, and concerned constituents contacted me after they were cut. So it's right and proper to see that the government is restoring the loading for these critical services.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was also glad to see in the budget the government's expansion of the headspace centre network. The communities of Indi worked so hard to get a headspace in Wodonga and Wangaratta. It's such an important support for young people in regional and rural areas, but we need to increase the capacity of these services, and that means encouraging young people to study mental health sciences and to work rurally. That's why, while this bill is good, it could be better, by offering mental health professionals who come to work in the regions the same level of debt forgiveness as doctors and nurse practitioners.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Around 22 per cent of rural and remote residents are living with a mental health or behavioural condition. Benalla, in my electorate of Indi, has double the state average of people experiencing mental ill health. Despite people in the regions being more likely to experience this mental ill health than people in the cities, we are 26 per cent less likely to see a psychologist. That's because the services simply are not there. Indeed, it would take 5,000 mental health workers in the regions to give us the same level of access to care that our city cousins have right now. There are no full-time mental health workers for young people in Myrtleford, and, where there are mental health services, like headspace in Wangaratta, there are lengthy waitlists. It is the same in towns like Alexandra, where local people often must travel miles away to Melbourne or Shepparton, disrupting school, work and family.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2019, 90 per cent of headspace centres reported major challenges in meeting demand for their services, with the main reason being workforce availability for mental health clinicians, GPs and private practitioners. This massive shortage of mental health services was compounded again after the devastating 2019 Black Summer fires and followed by COVID-19 lockdowns. Many communities struggled to come together to heal, and the mental health impacts can have, and have had, serious long-term impacts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my first term of parliament, I fought hard to secure more funding for mental health services in Indi. After the 2019 bushfires, I lobbied the former government to secure $800,000 in funding for mental health programs, including for mental health nurses in Corryong and drug and alcohol responses, but, again, the issue was trying to get the workforce to carry out that work. I'll continue to advocate for improved services for those in the community suffering from eating disorders, which, sadly, increased in prevalence again during COVID-19.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Constituents are constantly contacting me about mental health. They are constantly contacting me about the challenges they face in getting the right help for themselves and their loved ones, about the impact it has on them, their community, their work and their relationships, about the high cost of mental health care and about the long distances they need to travel to access that care. Mental health workers have told me about the alarming increase in demand for their services, and they're struggling to meet it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to acknowledge their hard work, and I also want to applaud the community members who are working in community connection and prevention, including the Grit and Resilience Program in Wangaratta, led by Bek Nash-Webster. This program is a community led suicide prevention program that focuses on social and environmental determinants of health. It does this by creating opportunities for people to connect through social groups, like the women's tables and the separated dads group, and events such as street parties. It promotes inclusion in the community. The Grit and Resilience Program is so successful that it hopes to continue with future federal government grants and possibly expand to other communities, such as Mansfield.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As an Independent, I can recognise good work wherever it's done, but I can also recognise where more work is needed. I will always be an unflinching voice for rural Australians. This bill will help address the need for doctors and nurse practitioners in rural Australia, but the government can do more to recognise and address the dire state of mental health. That's why I'm calling on the government today to include, in their next budget, provisions for mental health workers to be included under this scheme. This would allow psychologists, mental health nurses, psychiatrists and social workers to have all or part of their outstanding university HELP debt reduced when they reside and work in rural and regional Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I recently met with the Minister for Education and was glad to receive his interest for including mental health workers in future budgets, and I look forward to working closely with him on this policy. Including these mental health workers in future budgets is smart, it's targeted and it would give a clear signal to students that the need is great and the opportunities wonderful if you choose a career in rural mental health. At a time like this, when our regions have suffered almost three years of bushfires, a pandemic, border closures and, now, floods, the time is right for this investment, on top of the investment the government is making for nurse practitioners and doctors.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So I'm very pleased to receive the Minister for Education's interest in my proposal. I hope to continue to work together with him and his team. I really want to see this government invest not only in doctors and nurse practitioners but also in mental health professionals in rural and regional Australia, in the next budget and right out into the future.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr GILLESPIE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyne</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:25</span>):  I rise in support of this bill, the Higher Education Support Amendment (2002 Measures No. 1) Bill 2022, and the amendment foreshadowed by the shadow minister for education.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The biggest compliment one can get is that of imitation. This bill comes from legislation I introduced when I was the Minister for Regional Health. I'm so pleased that the current Labor government has decided to back the initiative, because we do have a problem. We have a major shortage of multiskilled general practitioners and nurse practitioners in regional and remote Australia. We have a shortage of general practitioners even in suburbia, but the situation is worst in regional Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The initiative at the heart of this bill is to give graduates in medicine and nurse practitioner studies relief from repayment of their HECS-HELP debt. If you work in very remote Australia, an area defined by the Modified Monash Model classification system as MMM 6 or MMM 7, for the length of your postgraduate degree—either a nurse practitioner degree or a medical degree—you get two years credit for one year worked. If you do a six-year medical degree and you work for three years in rural and remote Australia, your HECS debt will be wiped—it will be relieved. For nurse practitioners it's a two-year postgraduate doctorate, which means that if you do one year in an area that's between regional and very remote it's one for one. If you've done a six-year medical degree and you've done six years of service, the HECS debt, which can amount to $100,000, is waived. The minimum amount you've got to do is half your medical degree. You can't just turn up for six months and get the benefit; you've got to do the hard yards. That involves working 24 hours a week in that area as a doctor or as a nurse practitioner.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There were a few bumps in the classification system, so this bill includes amendments to cover people who, up until 1 January 2021, had been enrolled in a postgraduate master's degree in medical practice. They are now effectively grandfathered and covered.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This initiative will shift people. A lot of people really like their experience as a med student when they are doing their rotations through regional Australia. We've organised for half of the training at med school and for medical registrars to be done in regional Australia, acknowledging the shortage of workforce. But having this financial carrot makes a lot of sense to younger graduates at a stage in their life when they are putting down roots. If I could have offered this during the period of government back to 2013, I wonder how many more doctors and nurse practitioners would have stayed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The shadow minister for education has foreshadowed an amendment that calls for a review of these changes to take place two years after they're put in place. We want the review to consider, with the help of the National Rural Health Commissioner and the Regional Education Commissioner, other health graduates that are in equally short supply in regional Australia. Pharmacists, clinical psychologists, physiotherapists—all of those professions are really lacking. There's this huge magnet that drags people into metro Australia, and we really want to shift the dial on that. That's why we'll be moving this amendment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Overall, this is a great bill. I'm not trying to blow my own trumpet, but it really is a good idea. People in the industry recommended it, and I support this bill to the hilt.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BROADBENT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Monash</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:30</span>):  Thank you for the opportunity to address the parliament tonight on the keepers of the springs. Peter Marshall—not the Peter Marshall who's the United Firefighters Union secretary in Victoria, who's a friend of mine and I wish him all the best this Christmas, but the Peter Marshall that I'm talking about—was a Presbyterian minister who was the US Senate Chaplain from 1946 to 1948, during the presidency of Harry Truman. This is the start of one of his sermons:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">High up in the hills, a strange and quiet forest dweller took it upon himself to be the Keeper of the Springs. He patrolled the hills and wherever he found a spring, he cleaned its brown pool of silt and fallen leaves, of mud and mold and took away from the spring all foreign matter, so that the water which bubbled up through the sand ran down clean and cold and pure. It leaped sparkling over rocks and dropped joyously in crystal cascades until, swollen by other streams, it became a river of life to the busy town. Millwheels were whirled by its rush. Gardens were refreshed by its waters. Fountains threw it like diamonds into the air. Swans sailed on its limpid surface, and children laughed as they played on its banks in the sunshine.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">But the City Council was a group of hard-headed, hard-boiled businessmen. They scanned the civic budget and found in it the salary of a Keeper of the Springs. Said the Keeper of the Purse: "Why should we pay this romance ranger? We never see him; he is not necessary to our town's work life. If we build a reservoir just above the town, we can dispense with his services and save his salary." Therefore, the City Council voted to dispense with the unnecessary cost of a Keeper of the Springs, and to build a cement reservoir.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">So the Keeper of the Springs no longer visited the brown pools but watched from the heights while they built the reservoir. When it was finished, it soon filled up with water, to be sure, but the water did not seem to be the same. It did not seem to be as clean, and a green scum soon befouled its stagnant surface. There were constant troubles with the delicate machinery of the mills, for it was often clogged with slime, and the swans found another home above the town. At last, an epidemic raged, and the clammy, yellow fingers of sickness reached into every home in every street and lane.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The City Council met again. Sorrowfully, it faced the city's plight, and frankly it acknowledged the mistake of the dismissal of the Keeper of the Springs. They sought him out of his hermit hut high in the hills, and begged him to return to his former joyous labor. Gladly he agreed, and began once more to make his rounds. It was not long until pure water came lilting down under tunnels of ferns and mosses and to sparkle in the cleansed reservoir. Millwheels turned again as of old. Stenches disappeared. Sickness waned and convalescent children playing in the sun laughed again because the swans had come back.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Who are these keepers of the wells? These keepers of the wells are the clerks of this House, the unseen, the unknown to the general public; our Hansard staff; the Parliamentary Library; our committee staff and support; our DPS staff, seen and unseen; those who work down in the dungeons of this building that keep the House ticking over; our own members of staff in our offices; the people who feed us in the cafes and restaurants of Parliament House; the transport office, our Commonwealth car drivers; our chamber stewards in the room tonight, and their daughters and families—and how's the dog?—our gardeners, cleaners and security staff; and our friends on the other side of the chamber.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd also like to thank the 156,000 Australian government public servants, who keep the machinery of government running, whether we're here or not, and during any caretaker period of a government. Of course, last but not least, thank you to all the whips—especially Zane, Jess, Alannah and Leonie—and, Mr Speaker, to you and all the other deputy speakers, who have made such a difference to the running of this House. The way you perform your task has been exemplary, and I congratulate you on that. I've been around for a number of Speakers. I've seen your gentle hand upon this House and the way you have performed, and I'd like to personally congratulate you on this year's work. I'd like you to pass that on to all the deputy speakers.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms THWAITES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Jagajaga</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:35</span>):  People rightly expect from those of us in public life, as representatives for and of the public, that we uphold high standards of integrity. We are elected to this place by our communities to be their voice, and they place their trust in us to govern in their best interests. It's not news to anyone in this place that trust in this parliament as an institution and trust in those of us in here is unfortunately declining. That is a trend we must be aware of, that we must be concerned about and that we must be actively working to do something about.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important to note that last week the government released the findings of the inquiry conducted by the former High Court Justice Virginia Bell into the multiple ministries the former PM, the member for Cook, appointed himself to without the knowledge of his ministers. Treasury, Home Affairs, Industry, Science, Energy and Resources: portfolio after portfolio was secretly added in a series of self-importance. The Bell inquiry has called these appointments, among other things, 'troubling', 'extremely irregular', 'bizarre' and 'unnecessary'. It really does go to that question of trust in this place as an institution and trust in the work that we do here. That is why it is so important that it is addressed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will quote from the Bell report because I think it is important that this place considers this. The report found:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Given that the Parliament was not informed of any of the appointments, it was unable to hold Mr Morrison to account in his capacity as minister administering any of these five departments.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It found that the principles of responsible government were 'fundamentally undermined' and:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… the lack of disclosure of the appointments to the public was apt to undermine public confidence in government. Once the appointments became known, the secrecy with which they had been surrounded was corrosive of trust in government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What the former Prime Minister did should never have happened.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Bell inquiry has made six recommendations to improve transparency, accountability and public trust, and I am very pleased that our government is set to accept all of these recommendations and to work quickly to see them implemented. It is important for all of us in here that we set a new tone about how we go about our work in this place. We don't want this to be a place where people think we just thrive on division or that the work we do is all about shouting at each other and secrecy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I'm proud that in the six months so far of this new government we have made a break with practices of the past and we are showing that we want to work together to get good work done on behalf of our communities. That is what Australians want to see from us. We are taking a collaborative, positive approach as we deliver important reforms that our communities also want to see.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think this approach was demonstrated during debate on the climate change bill, when we had the government working closely with members of the crossbench and members across the parliament to deliver the first real, substantial plan on climate action that we've seen in 10 years—something this parliament had been unable to do for 10 years. Of course, we have the National Anti-Corruption Commission legislation currently making its way through the parliament. Again, the government has been listening to and working with people across this place to get us a good result on legislation that is going to be crucial for restoring trust in this place and for making sure that we are conducting ourselves with integrity as we go forward.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">People ask me, 'Does this parliament feel different to the last parliament?' and I say to them, 'It absolutely does.' I think some of it is a vibe, but we can't rely on a vibe only. So it is important that our government are making these structural and substantial changes, changes that show that we want to treat each other with respect in this place, that we want to uphold this parliament as an institution, that we think it's important for our democracy that we don't govern in a culture of secrecy and that, for all of us in here, our job is to show our communities that they can trust us and that we are here for them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am pleased and proud of the work our government have done so far. I know there is more to do. I'll be very pleased to see a code of conduct come forward for all of us in this place, as recommended by the Jenkins review. I think that will be the next important step in the work we are all trying to do to make this a parliament that we can be proud of, to make this a parliament that Australians can trust and to make sure that we govern in a way that not only gets us good results but also shows people that this is a place they can respect.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="HWP" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs MARINO</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Forrest</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:40</span>):  Our local community has been deeply saddened by the loss of Murray Piggott, who passed away suddenly at his family's farming property in Brunswick Junction. Murray was a wonderful man and a true gentleman absolutely committed to his family, his friends and the Brunswick community. He was always the first person to help anyone who needed a hand, putting aside whatever he might have been doing at the time. He had a major impact on the community throughout his life through his involvement with the Lions Club, the Brunswick Agricultural Society and countless other local organisations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the time he passed away, late on that Monday afternoon, Murray was doing what he loved: working on his farm, getting the tractor and rake ready for the next day's work. He was right in the middle of hay season, with 150 acres of hay cut and ready to be raked and baled. So next morning, after losing Murray, his nephew Mark Talbot started ringing around the local farming community to try to get a few machines and the gear needed to come to the farm to help rake, bale and cart Murray's hay. He told me the response was truly humbling—in fact, it left him in tears. As the word got around, more and more people rang to offer help. Each one of them said that Murray had helped them over the years and they'd never forgotten his help.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A day later 'Murray's muster' happened. There were seven hay rollers, five hay rakes, seven loaders, six trucks and a team of local people all helping. Eight hours later, 600 bales had been rolled, 650 bales had been carted and stacked and 1,000 small square bales had been raked, baled and carted. To top it off, his fire breaks were all done as well. There was a video made of the muster, and it was an emotional experience for those of us who've watched it. But it is a genuine example of true Brunswick spirit in our rural and regional community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was most of all a testament to Murray Piggott and an indication of the great respect and genuine affection he'd earnt throughout his life. Yes, as I said, it was emotional to watch, but it was also quietly satisfying for those who'd helped. They'd done something for Murray that he would have done for them. As Mark, his nephew, said, every time help was needed, Murray was his first call. He was also the first call for many others. If something was broken, Murray would fix it. He was a self-taught and amazing welder and mechanic, and I don't think there was any piece of gear that he couldn't operate or fix.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've watched that video, and to see the amount of tractors and trucks literally working on Murray's property was an absolute credit to the Brunswick community. I thank every farmer who turned up with a piece of gear to get that work done. I thank Mark and everyone who helped in that as well.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Murray was part of so many projects in the community throughout his life. He built so many buildings on the local showgrounds. He worked in his shed solving people's problems. As I said, he was a self-taught engineer and mechanic. He loved a joke. He loved farmers' gatherings. He always had a joke, even at the Lions events. The last one I remember him doing was part of the Blue Tree Project for men's health. Murray Piggott loved helping others. He will be remembered with great love, with great respect and with great affection.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My condolences go to his wonderful wife and life partner, Val. They were a fabulous team. My condolences also go to his family. I also offer my condolences to his sister, Judy; her family; and all of us throughout the Brunswick community who grieve his loss. From his involvement in so many community organisations, I know that the grief and sadness is widely felt around Brunswick. But we do know that Murray earned all of the respect that he so deserved. So vale, Murray. Your life's work is done. May you rest in peace.</span>

                  <a href="I8M" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr CHARLTON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Parramatta</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:44</span>):  As the second oldest city in Australia, the history of Parramatta is also the history of Australia. As Parramatta continues on its path to becoming a global city, we must protect its heritage. Whatever lies ahead in Parramatta's future, I am determined to make sure we never forget where it all began.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This month I held a community forum on the future of Parramatta's heritage, alongside the Minister for the Environment and Water, marking the first steps in a community-led approach towards heritage management in the city. At the forum, community groups were asked to present their visions for the future of Parramatta's heritage and for how it can be managed so that these treasures remain a core part of the community for generations to come. The forum, held almost five years to the day from the Parramatta Female Factory's National Heritage listing, marks a new chapter in the fight to protect Parramatta's heritage treasures.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the fight to preserve Parramatta's heritage didn't start with me. It started with the community, and I want to recognise the decade of passionate advocacy that has brought us to where we are today, from community leaders and groups like Gay Hendriksen of the Parramatta Female Factory Friends, Suzette Meade and Phil Russo from the North Parramatta Residents Action Group, and Bonney Djuric and Liz Scully. After a decade of activism, we have taken important steps to making sure Parramatta's heritage treasures remain an integral part of the community for decades to come.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My electorate is also home to the Toongabbie Legal Centre. I've always been driven by the belief that we, as a society, should be defined by our capacity to help the most vulnerable. Across the country, community legal centres provide an incredibly valuable service to society's most vulnerable members. Whether it be those experiencing financial hardship, domestic violence or cultural and linguistic barriers, or those facing discrimination, help from a community legal centre can be life-changing. Parramatta has long been a launching pad for first-generation immigrants, and many have gone on to reach their aspirations thanks to these community legal centres.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For the last 15 years, the Toongabbie Legal Centre has been providing free legal assistance to more than 10,000 vulnerable community members. Run by over 50 volunteers, the Toongabbie Legal Centre has continued to deliver these services, despite no core funding from state or federal governments. Instead, it relies on community fundraising and donations to support its good work, and it's a reflection of the value of this organisation that the centre has been continually funded through this model. But this model does have its limits.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The growing demand for legal assistance from the local community has forced the centre to explore options for growth. It currently operates out of a hall next to Saint Anthony's Church in Toongabbie, but it's fast outgrowing the space. In response to these pressures, the centre has begun crowdfunding for a new permanent location from which to continue delivering community legal services to Western Sydney.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, the next time you're in town, have a think about dropping by one of their many fundraising events, or make a donation at the Toongabbie Legal Centre website, because every contribution will ensure that the important work of the Toongabbie Legal Centre continues into the future.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr WILLCOX</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dawson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:49</span>):  It's clear that Albanese government looks after those who live in the cities and leaves behind those who don't. The people of my electorate of Dawson—a rural area—like those in all regional areas, are paying the price of this Labor government. Key nation-building and community-strengthening infrastructure projects in my patch have been scrapped, and that will have devastating impacts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Whitsundays is a tourism mecca. With 74 beautiful islands, we are the heart of the Great Barrier Reef. Tourists come from across the globe to visit these islands and explore one of the seven natural wonders of the world. With most families owning a boat, boat ownership per capita in the Whitsundays is among the highest anywhere.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Prior to the election, the coalition committed $420,000 to Volunteer Marine Rescue Whitsunday. This funding was vital. It would have gone a long way towards improving the safety of the thousands of water users in the Whitsundays. The volunteers of VMR are hardworking, committed volunteers who dedicate themselves to greater safety in the Whitsundays, but their work is being undermined by facilities that are too small. This means that crucial programs, like first aid courses and navigation training, cannot happen. They simply don't have enough room to run the events.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've visited these incredible volunteers multiple times and I've seen firsthand their need to expand their facility, to allow space for regular search and rescue services as well as full-scale rescue operations. It is vital that this club of around 50 dedicated volunteers has the appropriate technology and space to keep our boaties and tourists safe on the water. If funding for organisations such as VMR is what the Albanese government defines as waste then that is disgraceful.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another group left behind are the veterans in and around Mackay. The coalition government committed to investing $5 million in veterans wellness in my electorate of Dawson. This would have brought an RSL complex to Mackay, a wellness centre to the Mackay Memorial Swim Centre and a retreat at Kinchant Dam. The wellness facilities were designed to support defence personnel, veterans, and first responders and their families, but the Labor government have axed it. In fact, they have axed all veterans wellness centres north of Brisbane. The regions are being brushed again.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What kind of message does this send? I'm appalled. If our men and women are willing to put their bodies on the line—to put their lives on the line for our security and the sovereignty of our nation—the very least we should do is offer them support when they come home. The peace of our country comes at a cost. There is an immediate cost, but there is also a hidden cost that chips away at the mental health of our returned service men and women. The toll on our veterans is great. Many of our veterans come home having experienced the terror of war, a trauma that can stay with them for the rest of their lives. When in government, the coalition invested a record amount in our veterans, and that is a legacy I am extremely proud of. It is disappointing that the government would remove this funding and put it in the wastebasket. How we honour our veterans is a mark of our nation. Regional Aussies deserve more from their government, which is there to represent everyone.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These are just a couple of projects that would have made a huge difference in the life of my local community. I haven't even spoken of the other critical projects that the government has canned: Mackay Hockey; Ayr Industrial Estate; the Proserpine P&amp;C shade project—they've taken money off the P&amp;C; Alligator Creek community sporting hall; the Urannah dam; and Bowen pipeline. I will continue to fight hard for these projects because I believe that when the regions are strong, all of Australia is strong. When the parts of Australia that produce the nation's wealth, like those in the electorate of Dawson, are supported, the whole nation will prosper. This government needs to step up and start representing all Australians.</span>

Tonight I stand to honour and pay my respects to the 40 women who have died this year. This equates to almost one violent death every week in 2022. Regrettably, the actual number is likely to be much higher, as the list is limited to deaths that have been publicly reported. Before I acknowledge each woman who is no longer with us, I want to acknowledge the researchers from Destroy the Joint, who do the heartbreaking and difficult work of maintaining the Counting Dead Women Register Australia, where this information is recorded.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Australia in 2022 we have lost the following woman: Poonam Sharma, aged 39; Krishna Chopra, 61. Christine Stephan, 68; Amina Hayat, 19; Angela Huata, 41; Vanessa Godfrey, 46; Synamin Bell, 26; Kylie Griffiths, 36; Sharyn Simonds, 60; Susan Walker, 74; Mackenzie Anderson, 21; Linda Simon, 62; Danielle Jordan, 40; Chen Cheng, 35; Donna Howe, 57; Feebie McIntosh, 25; Shirley Kidd, 68; Cheryl Johnson, 62; AK, 30, and her 15-week-old infant; Shereen Kumar, 43; Maree Schwartz, 59; Jifeng 'Eileen' Liu, 47; Florrie 'Kory' Reuben, 47; Tania Trickey, 44; Amneh al-Hazouri, known as Amy, 39; Lametta Fadlallah, 48; Susan Duffy, 71; Barbara Willshire, 92; Louise Hughes, 51; Nardia Louise Spice, 40; Christine Barker, 74; Emily Thompson, 18; Sheena Fairfield, 39; Vitorina Bruce, 40; and another six unnamed women. Each of these debts is a tragedy, and each death should fully galvanise us as political leaders to do everything necessary to end this national scourge of violence against women and children in our nation.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are currently marking the 16 Days of Activism against Gender-Based Violence in Australia, and I want to pay tribute to the Newcastle domestic violence committee, which last Friday held a candlelight vigil, as many cities and towns around Australia did, to remember the woman killed by violence in 2022. I'm sick of attending candlelight vigils, and I don't want to have to stand in this parliament each and every year reciting the list of women who have been killed by the most violent means imaginable, but I will stand here, because each and every one of those women needs to be remembered, and their deaths can never be in vain. We have to stop violence against women and children, and we need to do it now.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am very proud that an Albanese Labor government, in partnership with the states and territories, has developed a new national plan to end gender based violence within a generation. This is a big ambition, because all of the statistics in this country are heading in the wrong direction and, notwithstanding efforts from governments over time, we have failed to make a dent in this regard. We will also honour our commitment to a standalone dedicated national action plan to support First Nations women, but it's up to every single one of us to make sure we put those words into action.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="300246" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BATES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Brisbane</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:30</span>):  This Thursday 1 December is National Water Safety Day. As we come up on the holiday period over summer, it's essential that we keep water safety in mind. Between 1 July 2021 and 30 June 2022, 339 people lost their lives to drowning in Australia. There's an even higher risk during the holiday period when many of us will be spending time in the water trying to escape the heat.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Royal Life Saving Society of Australia estimated that more than 40 per cent of Australian children leave primary school unable to achieve the national swimming and water safety benchmarks for the age of 12 years. A lack of swimming skills and water safety knowledge is, of course, a major risk factor in drowning. The pandemic has further exacerbated this issue with many children's swim education being disrupted over the last two years. This is a serious risk to the safety of children who will be spending increasing amounts of time participating in aquatic activities over the summer holidays. It is therefore important to reaffirm the importance of preparation and vigilance when it comes to water safety and to take this Thursday as an opportunity to reflect on your family's preparedness to be spending time at the beach or in the pool. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">However, it's not just swimming for leisure that we need to consider on Water Safety Day. Unfortunately, as we continue to see the impact of climate change, we can expect more and more frequent and intense flooding disasters. As my electorate office prepares for the potential of more catastrophic floods in our community, I want to urge everyone to remember: if it's flooded, forget it; never try and rescue a flooded item; and don't underestimate the dangers of flash flooding. All levels of government have to play a role in helping to prevent drowning tragedies. At a council level, it's important that all relevant decision-makers treat water safety as the serious issue that it is and ensure that all signage is visible and clear. Also of extreme importance is making sure that multilingual information is available, especially for those visiting from overseas where there is not always consistency in symbols which represent water safety dangers. Every drowning is a tragedy that we should aim to prevent. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to acknowledge the incredible work of Surf Life Saving Australia, the Royal Life Saving Society of Australia, and all the incredible organisations and people that contribute to water safety and aquatic rescue. Above all, remember to swim between the flags and never to swim alone. If you can't identify aquatic risks like rips or strong tides, then find a patrolled area to swim rather than risk your own safety. Discuss these issues with your family and ensure that, if you're going to be spending time in the water this holiday season, be prepared, swim in protected areas, don't take risks and never swim alone. If we all commit to these principles, we can ensure a safe and fun summer ahead for everyone. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Retail workers are the backbone of our economy. Australia must step up and protect the people who are our frontline, the workers who keep the nation running, before it's too late. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">As challenges continue to unravel after the pandemic, now is the time for our society and economy, as well as our government and businesses, to show retail workers that they are a valued part of our nation.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">In order to rebuild our society, the government must invest in maintaining and nurturing our workers, thus creating a safe work environment free from abuse.

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="300120" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PIKE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bowman</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:36</span>):  Over the weekend I met with many small businesses in my community of the Redlands, and they were of one voice in their opposition to the government's extreme industrial relations bill. For the many businesses in my electorate who've not got the luxury of a big human resources department, this will add significantly to their costs and the complexity of doing business. The latest ABS data reveals that 180 local Redland businesses have 20 employees or more and will be in the firing line of these changes. The Redland industries most at risk include accommodation and food services, construction, retail, manufacturing and health care. The government's own regulatory impact statement has estimated that Labor's legislation will cost small businesses $14,600 in bargaining costs, including consultancy fees. For medium-sized businesses, the cost would be over $80,000. Local businesses simply shouldn't have to absorb costs of this magnitude. This would be an incredibly poor outcome at a time when we need Redland businesses to continue to grow and create jobs for locals.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My community has also been outraged by the $50 million that the government has cut from the Safer Communities Fund, a program used by the previous government to deliver CCTV cameras in the Redlands. The former Liberal and Nationals government utilised the fund to deliver some much-needed CCTV cameras around the Redlands, and I was hoping to utilise it to continue to deliver even more. Redland City Council was the beneficiary of two grants totalling over $110,000—the funding provided for 31 CCTV cameras across known trouble spots at Capalaba Place and Weinam Creek ferry terminal at Redland Bay. Since their introduction, Weinam Creek has seen a reduction in auto crimes and antisocial behaviour. Many Bay Islands residents have reported to me that they are now feeling a lot safer at night as they make their way from their cars to the ferry. During the recent election, Liberals and Nationals had committed to investing a further $175,000 to deliver CCTV cameras at hooning hotspots around Cleveland Point. I am calling on the Albanese Labor government to reverse this decision and to restore the funding that has served many communities across Australia so well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm also calling on the federal government to provide clarity on all of the local projects that had previously received federal funding commitments but which on we now have radio silence—the Redland Bay Head to Health facility; the second round of funding for stage 1 upgrades at the Redland Hospital; the intersection upgrades at Wellington Street and Panorama Drive; and all the commitments made by the Labor opposition in the lead-up to this federal election that they have failed to provide any detail on over the subsequent six months.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">April was a great month. I announced a $500,000 commitment in funding to restore the Merri Creek, alongside the member for Cooper and the passionate members from the Merri Creek Management Committee and Friends of Merri Creek. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In September I had the honour of being elected chair of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security.

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In October I, with the Minister for Early Childhood Education and Minister for Youth, paid a visit to Lake Park Kindergarten, a bilingual kindergarten in North Coburg. Dr Siobhan Hannan, an experienced early educator, showed us around and the kids taught us a few words in Italian. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In November I spoke at the African Festival at Fed Square and had a dance—please don't watch the video! I celebrated the 90th anniversary of the Cyprus Community of Melbourne and Victoria, a great local community of long standing—90 years. And I delivered on the Albanese Labor government's election commitment of $25,000 to support the Anatolian Alevi Festival at Coburg Lake. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hinkler</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:41</span>):  In Bundaberg and Hervey Bay, it's business awards season, and there are some cracking businesses that have been recognised in both Bundaberg and the bay. I can't name them all in three minutes, but I have to point a couple of them out.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the Bundaberg and District Chamber of Commerce Awards, the Personal Services Business of the Year award and the People's Choice Award went to The Place Hairdressing, Kiralee and the team down there. I can tell you: you see them just about everywhere. They've got a bit of an attraction to the track; they seem to like some of those events. It's good to see them out there, very proud of their business and the work that they do. The Trade, Industrial and Manufacturing Business of the Year award went to Arcon Metals Recycling. It is very valuable work that they do in the local region.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a couple of big ones. The Agribusiness of the Year award went to Macadamias Australia and the Tourism Visitor Attraction Business of the Year award went to Lady Musgrave Experience. Both are very well-known businesses in the local region. Macadamias Australia have an incredible story. They started as a family farming organisation and still are. They started as tomato and sugarcane growers and have now expanded into macadamias, macadamia processing and tourism. Brett Lakey and the team at the Lady Musgrave Experience keep wading through all that red and green tape to operate on the reef, but they provide an absolutely incredible tourism experience out there. Those two organisations are joint winners of the Business of the Year award.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Down on Hervey Bay, in the Fraser Coast Business and Tourism Awards, the Best Fraser Coast Business award—who'd have thought it?—went to a whale business, Whalesong Cruises. If you want to see the whales, there is nowhere better than Hervey Bay. It's nice and calm. It's always a wonderful experience there. We have so many thousands of veterans in the local region in Hervey Bay, and the Hervey Bay RSL does a great job and provides lots of support. One of my personal favourites in retailing—and I'm sure this is no surprise to those who are listening—is Pie and Pastry Paradise, a fabulous shop. It's very tempting every time you go past.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to give a shout out to the winner of the Events and Event Management award: Dunga Derby. What an Australian name! Since 2015, this four-day car rally has been running and delivering money to the Rally for a Cause charity. They have raised $2.4 million since 2015. Major sponsors are Hyne Timber and HBW Foodservice. The donations go back to local families in need in the Hervey Bay area. What a great way to do it—a four-day car rally raising money for the local community. It's a lot of fun, and I'm really pleased they have been recognised. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Education Provider of the Year award went to Riverside Christian College. The Community and Charities Award went to the Hervey Bay Neighbourhood Centre, who do such a wonderful job helping the homeless and others who are less fortunate. Congratulations to Tanya Stevenson and, of course, to the chairman, Bernie Whebell. They work incredibly hard in what is a difficult area of social services and support. They've been great supporters locally and they continue to do a great job. I'm so pleased that they've been recognised in the prestigious awards for the Fraser Coast Business and Tourism Awards held on 11 November.</span>

The holiday period is one of joy and celebration, but it can also be an incredibly tough time for many families who are celebrating Christmas for the first time without a loved one, and that is never easy. If Christmas brings up emotions for you, please remember that there is help available from organisations like Lifeline, Beyond Blue and many others. Please make sure you reach out if you need to.</span>

We're now entering the holiday period, and many will be going away for the first time in several years. It's a time when there will be more people on the road, so I encourage all in our community to be extra vigilant on the road and to stay safe. No matter where you're off to, or how late you may be, please take your time. Take care and remember: double demerit points will be enforced.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a privilege to be elected as the representative of my community in this place. It has been wonderful to attend so many community events this year and to meet with constituents and community members. Thank you to everyone who has sent me an invitation and to all the volunteers for all the work you've done in the electorate this year. Werriwa is an incredibly diverse electorate and I thank all the multicultural groups for inviting me to celebrations, meeting with me to discuss their concerns and for their work in our community. Particularly during the worst of COVID, you were incredibly important in making sure that the updated information was provided in a form that could be understood by your community.</span>

You've been keeping our community safe, and I appreciate it. The dedication you show is unwavering and amazing. All of your work and all the work of all volunteers doesn't go unnoticed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Please remember to drive carefully over the holiday break. Don't drive through floodwaters as you put yourselves and anybody who has to rescue you in danger. Keep abreast of all the warnings, and, most of all, thank you to everybody in Werriwa for trusting me to be your representative again. Merry Christmas and happy holidays. Please keep safe, and I look forward to working with you all next year.</span>

This year participants were asked what should Australia's new parliament accomplish? Through the group Raise Our Voice I received a number of local contributions, three of which I'm going to cite today. They are from Taj Carver, Lucy Shepherd and Ava Ross. I'll start with Taj Carver, who I will read in full, for there is nothing I like more than a 15-year-old who has come to grips with section 44 of the Australian Constitution.</span>

India is a country to which I've had the good fortune of travelling for business and for pleasure, and it is one that I feel a great affinity for. The electorate of Hasluck is home to more than 5,600 Indian-born Australians and almost 9,000 with a parent from India, and that number is growing. Punjabi was recorded at the last census as the second-most-spoken language in the electorate, having surpassed Italian, which had been in that position for decades. Gujarati and Hindi are also in the top 10, and all are increasing. Vibrant committee groups have established themselves, including the Sikh Gurudwara Perth Bennett Springs, the Shree Swaminarayan Temple, Ellenbrook Punjabi Council and Indian Australian News and Media.</span>

When we compare the $240 billion trade relationship Australia has with China with the approximately $24 billion relationship with India, the opportunity is stark and appears enormous. Look at what we share. We meet in democracy with a Westminster flavour, and yet both countries are federations. English is widely spoken in India, and cricket binds us eternally. Since the 2011 census, India has been our No. 1 point of origin for new migrants, after Britain had been the No. 1 point of origin for so long. There are over 100,000 Indian students studying in Australia right now—incidentally making up a great portion of our export figure. Some of them will end up staying here and making a life as new Aussies. Others will return to India and continue to be a connection between our two countries. I am glad that the agreement was signed back in March by the former government, but it was an agreement that took too long—more than 10 years—and was not given the priority that it should have had. We can do better.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The funding in the budget underscores how seriously this government is taking this relationship. There is $115.7 million in the budget for facilitating trade with India, including $42 million for the Centre for Australia-India relations in Parramatta. I'm sure my friend the member for Parramatta will agree that it is a fine location for the centre, with that region's Indian population being amongst the highest in the country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to see us develop this relationship to the point where we are working in partnership with India and prospering together. I know the Indian diaspora in Hasluck will agree with me. This agreement presents an opportunity for our two great countries to move on from a transactional trade relationship to create a genuine partnership within business and our communities.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fadden</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:53</span>):  What a fabulous year it has been on the Gold Coast. I take this opportunity to wish all Gold Coasters a fabulous Christmas, a wonderful time with family and friends and a wonderful break. The Gold Coast, as we know, is one of the greatest destinations on earth, with a vibrant community, a growing multicultural community, incredible facilities, marvellous weather, extraordinary beaches and, importantly, great people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have a few shout-outs for our community groups. The Cycling Without Age Gold Coast chapter has seen an exceptional year of growth. It's now one of the largest chapters in Australia. This year they purchased a wheelchair-accessible trishaw, which is superb for inclusivity. I give a big shout-out to Wayne Sticher, who started the Gold Coast chapter. He is an extraordinary Gold Coaster.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I give another big shout-out to the Alberton Ormeau Cricket Club, the Hurricanes. Their all-inclusive junior team for children with disability has gone from strength to strength. They're proud winners of a community cricket award, taking out the Queensland Cricket diversity and inclusion award. Well done to Lisa Wells and the entire team, who are champions in our community, and to Lisa Wells' mum, who has championed just so many things in that area.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank our Rotary clubs for the great work they're doing, especially the Rotary Club of Hope Island for their remembrance island, where I spent Remembrance Day this year, and for the wonderful work they're doing in concert with Mulpha. I thank Sandra Doumany, the past district president, for her extensive service to Rotary. Of course, she received an OAM in recognition of that service, matching what her wonderful husband, Sam Doumany, has done. He has also been recognised in award ceremonies in previous years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank the men's sheds for what they're doing, and I wish the new leadership all the best. I thank our multicultural groups, especially our Indian communities, who are going from strength to strength. I'm so looking forward to their new facility and their new place of worship, which is being built at Arundel. I look forward to going there for the opening.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I wish all of our Gold Coast schools and our year-12s who are finishing now all the very best. Well done on your exams and all the very best for your futures. I turn now to the schoolies. Queensland schoolies have finished. New South Wales schoolies are now partaking of our world-class beaches. Be safe. Take care of each other.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank our businesses for employing Australians. Youth unemployment is at seven per cent, women's unemployment is at its lowest level in history and women's participation is at its highest level in history. This is a legacy of the Morrison government. So, businesses, thank you for the work you're putting in.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of our election commitments, exits 41, 45 and 49 are being built, exit 38 is next, the Harbour Town intersection is complete, light rail has been funded and the M1 has been funded. We are certainly standing up. The LNP is delivering for the Gold Coast.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Higgins</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:57</span>):  Recently I had my eyes opened, literally. I visited Vision Australia, which has its headquarters in the suburb of Kooyong in my electorate. The work they do is nothing short of life-changing. If you doubt for a minute how important Vision Australia is, I suggest you tie a tea towel around your head and try to walk around this chamber. Failing vision does not cause just blindness; there are many other flow-on effects, from falls to depression, loss of independence, medication mistakes, difficulty with personal care and social isolation, for both children and adults. Vision Australia provides practical and emotional support for all these problems and more.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">During my visit I met Stella the working dog, who is really stellar. Vision Australia has its own in-house breeding program that ensures its puppies both are amenable to trading and work till the age of at least six or seven, and sometimes up to 11. I felt an alphabet book, where A is something with sharp spikes and even sharper teeth. Felix packs containing these tactile books are mailed out to children all over Australia and are put together by kind-hearted volunteers. I saw gadgets that actually make a difference—how about glasses that tell you where you are going or a headset that sends images to the part of your retina that has functioning receptors! I found out that the most requested aids for daily living are colour coded bump dots for appliances, bump dots for the power button on a remote control, a talking microwave that you can talk to to get it to defrost your food, a suction travel mug, magnifiers and a talking clock.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I'd like to share Suzanne's story with you. Suzanne says: 'I have diabetic eye disease. I have lost all the peripheral vision in my eyes. I used to walk directly into walls and gates. I have broken my ribs and wrists from falls. My son said, "Enough. We've got to go and get you some help."' Through Vision Australia, Suzanne received her cane, which she loves to bits. It is such a simple thing, and so life-changing. Suzanne is now on the NDIS and is hoping to be able to use public transport for herself. She wants to start painting as a hobby and she's sure that Vision Australia will be able to help her. Her favourite game to play with her granddaughter is—wait for it!—peek-a-boo.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">'It's all about working with what you have.' That was a phrase said by one of the occupational therapists at Vision Australia. I believe that that's an admirable way to live as well.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition has a strong record when it comes to delivering for Australians. During our time in government, we doubled investment in the early childhood education sector to $11 billion in 2022-23, and we also did something that Labor never did and that is delivering ongoing preschool funding. We locked in a four-year preschool reform agreement with states and territories which drives greater participation, especially for Indigenous and disadvantaged children. We undertook the biggest reforms to the childcare system in over 40 years, replacing a complex system with one which was better targeted and measured and which provided more support to families. Under the coalition, 280,000 more children were able to access early childhood education. We abolished the annual cap on the childcare subsidy and, since March of this year, we provided a higher subsidy for up to 95 per cent of families with multiple children. This targeted support also helped to bring down the cost of care, with June 2022 CPI data showing that childcare costs decreased by 4.6 per cent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When COVID hit, many industries, including the ECEC sector, were hit hard, and our $3.2 billion investment in the ECEC sector throughout the pandemic kept services viable and educators employed. This funding also ensured that families could continue to access care, preventing sector collapse and keeping services open, especially for vulnerable children and children of essential workers. This included three months of free child care during 2020, the waiving of gap fees in COVID related instances, and the increased number of allowable absences days from 42 to 52. We saw women's workforce participation reach record highs at 62.3 per cent when we left government in May 2022, compared to 58.7 per cent when Labor left office.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm proud of our record in this space, as we should be, but I'm also concerned for the future of the sector under this Albanese government because we had a plan—a good plan—and it's clear from what we've seen that this government doesn't have one. This government has no plan to address rising costs, no plan to address the lack of access and no plan to address current workforce concerns. This government has been full of sweeping statements: 'No family will be worse off. Fees won't increase. This policy won't have an effect on inflation. We'll have enough workers in the sector to meet demand.' These are all sweeping statements, but they haven't done any of the work to back up those statements.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The opposition and many others in this place are very, very concerned about this policy. We're concerned that there are not enough places for the additional children that may flood the system after 1 July next year and we're concerned that nine million Australians currently live in a childcare desert. That's nine million Australians who, if they have a child, will not be better off under this policy because they can't access care to begin with. Time and time again, we've asked about Labor's plan to address access issues, and they've provided simply nothing. We're also concerned about how educators will meet the increased influx of children from 1 July. Goodstart Early Learning says there are 7,200 current vacancies in the sector; some believe that to be under-represented and that there could be up to 20,000. That is a huge number, yet the government has no plans to fill those gaps and get new educators into the sector by 1 July.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The last time Labor was in government, childcare fees skyrocketed by 53 per cent in six years. We brought costs down, but, with fee increases expected, it's likely that some of the additional subsidies will be eroded, leaving families worse off. Labor's policy is full of empty promises and baseless statements, something I'm sure the 2024 review will shine a light on. The coalition wants to see the government do more to address concerns raised by educators, by the sector and, of course, by families. We want to see more done in terms of access in regional Australia in those communities that are doing it tough and those communities that currently don't have access to early learning centres. There is no infrastructure in some of those communities in regional and remote Australia, and we want to see that improved, particularly when there is $4.7 billion being invested in the sector.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We want to see a plan that will increase access and a plan to increase the pipeline of educators and retain them in the sector. Otherwise this policy will not deliver on the promises that they've sold to Australians, leaving many children and families and the sector much worse off. So we need more access. There is $4.7 billion but not one extra place from this government. We want to see greater access for families across the country, and we want to see infrastructure investment in more centres around the country so that more families can get back into work and send their kids to child care.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Adelaide</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:05</span>):  I ask the simple question: why didn't those opposite do something about the growing costs of early childhood education when they were in government? For example, there are a couple of things to debunk in the member for Moncrieff's statements. According to the last ABS survey, 73,000 people who wanted to work didn't look for work. Why was that the case? Because they couldn't make early childhood education costs work for them. Those opposite did absolutely nothing about it. Let's not forget that early childhood education costs increased by a whopping 41 per cent in the last eight years under the previous government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've wasted absolutely no time in addressing this problem. We've heard it over and over in this place: early childhood education reform is economic reform. It's an important economic reform, but it's also an issue that goes to the heart of how we value families, parenting, children and, of course, equality of access to work and choice.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that this reform will benefit around 96 per cent of families accessing early childhood education. In my electorate alone, the Adelaide electorate, approximately 10,200 families use an approved early childhood education provider. This reform that we have presented to the parliament will help around 96 per cent of those families, or 9,800 families. In the last month I've visited three childcare centres: the Lady Gowrie Child Centre in Thebarton in my electorate, the Plympton Goodstart and the Prospect Goodstart. I spoke with early learning providers and parents, and they all welcomed this proposal. They all welcomed our reform.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This reform is more important than ever, given the cost-of-living pressure that Australians are facing. Our early childhood education reform represents a $4.5 billion investment, and this reform does three important things. Firstly, it listens to what Australians ask for. It was an election commitment, and we delivered on that election commitment. Secondly, it's an economic reform. By cutting the cost of early education and care, it makes it easier for parents to return to work, particularly mothers. This is the type of reform that makes a difference regarding whether the primary carers work a fourth or fifth day. With the economy screaming out for skilled workers and many families needing or wanting to work additional hours, this reform means additional hours can be worked without people actually losing money. Let's face it: we are primarily talking about women's jobs here, and this reform will make it easier for women to choose when they wish to return to work or study. For the average Australian family on about $120,000 with one child in care three days a week, this reform will cut the cost by approximately $1,700 a year. That's $1,700 a year in a family's pocket. Thirdly, this reform is great for our children. All the experts tell us that early education and care is so important for a child's development. Education is transformative, but early childhood education has a particularly powerful impact to transform children's lives. All the experts are telling us this—all the studies that have been done and the research that's been done.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So this reform makes early childhood education and care more affordable, as I said, for about 1.26 million Australian families. As I said before, this is more important than ever. Let's not forget that early childhood education costs increased by a whopping 41 per cent under the former Liberal government's watch—41 per cent in the last eight years. This has been a significant burden to many Australian families who were already struggling to make ends meet.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Cheaper early childhood education is good for children, good for families and good for the economy, and we have delivered on the election commitment that we made to deliver cheaper early childhood education, when the previous government absolutely failed to do anything in this area. I heard stories of families that chose not to work that extra day because it ended up costing them more than it would have if they had gone to work. This policy basically fixes that. It allows people to make that choice to work the extra day. That's why it's a good— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="300147" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr VIOLI</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Casey</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:10</span>):  It's been a tough few years for Australians who work in early childhood education. They have struggled with the strains of the pandemic, and now, having come out the other side, workers are leaving the sector for other careers in record numbers. Despite the rhetoric from those on the other side, the coalition has always been a strong supporter of getting Australians back into the workforce after they have had children, and we have a strong record in this space. In fact, under the previous coalition government, the women's workforce participation rate was at an all-time high of 62.3 per cent in March 2022. This is compared to just 58.7 per cent when Labor left office. This is because we believe in choice. We believe that parents who work or study should be able to access care for their children if they wish to do so.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We introduced once-in-a-generation reforms to the childcare system in 2018 to provide more subsidies to families who need them most. We established a safety net to cover up to the full cost of full-time child care for disadvantaged children. On our watch, the annual cap on the childcare subsidy was abolished. Around 90 per cent of families using the childcare subsidy are currently eligible for a subsidy of between 50 and 85 per cent. This goes a long way towards getting more parents back into work without spending all of their earnings on child care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In March 2022 we provided higher childcare subsidies for second and subsequent children aged five or under, and we delivered this ahead of schedule, to help relieve struggling families. As a father with two children, I know—and the member for Hawke would know—that the second and third child can add a lot of pressure to the family budget. So that was a really important initiative that is making a difference for Australian families and allowing mothers and fathers to get back into the workforce.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But under Labor it's a very different story. Early childhood educators are leaving the sector at rapid rates, and all the Albanese government can do is talk about their fee-free TAFE places. This does not provide any immediate solutions to the shortages that we currently have. Free TAFE courses will not deliver this relief for a workforce under strain today. Something is needed right now. We all know economics 101, supply and demand—if we don't have the supply, and the demand is there, which it is, the cost is going to go up. The consequence is that we have centres capping enrolments and asking families to keep their children at home because they don't have the staff to operate at full capacity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Subsidies are one part of the equation. However, a subsidy is worth nothing if you can't access a childcare place. There is little use in having lower out-of-pocket costs when parents can't even get their children into care due to worker shortages and childcare deserts. A report from the Mitchell institute from earlier this year showed around nine million Australians live in a childcare desert, where centres have just one place available for every three children. This government has no immediate plan to create extra places or supporting staff but somehow thinks the system will cope with the influx of enrolments come July 2023. But I guess we really shouldn't be surprised, because, the last time Labor held government, childcare fees skyrocketed by 53 per cent in just six years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While the top line of this policy looks great and it looks like it provides the support for child care we all want to achieve, the devil is in the detail, as with most ALP policies. The government promised its childcare policy would deliver cost-of-living relief, but its spruiked subsidy increase isn't set to come into force until July 2023. They've changed the price tag on this policy four times now. First it was $5.4 billion. Then it was $5.1 billion. Then it was $4.5 billion. Now it's $4.7 billion.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor needs to explain to Australian parents why its plan to ease cost-of-living pressures related to child care won't come into effect for another eight months and how it will address the industry shortages. It is clear there has been no modelling and no due diligence done on this policy. Again, it shows that Labor cannot manage money. This is a policy that is heavy on political spin and light on real support for Australians and working families.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fraser</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:15</span>):  This is an incoherent motion and it reminds me of a joke from Woody Allen in <span style="font-style:italic;">Annie Hall</span><span style="font-style:italic;">,</span> where there are two unreasonable people criticising a restaurant. One person says to the other: 'Do you know what? I can't stand the food at that restaurant.' The first person says: 'I agree. Portions are so small.' It reminds me of this motion, where most of the motion says, 'We don't like the policy of the government, we don't like its criteria, we don't like the fact that it is so expansive but, gee, they should do it immediately.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a weird incoherent motion that, in a lot of ways, reflects the time in government in this space of those opposite. I remember very clearly when I was a backbencher in the previous term reading reports of the intense arguments going on in their party room, where a number of prominent backbenchers claimed that any kind of expansion of child care would reflect women outsourcing parenting. This was the big debate on child care in their party room and was reflected in so many ways in which they dealt with the policy area. It reflected what happened in JobKeeper, where so many people in this sector were excluded from JobKeeper when they were casual or part-time, and this contributed, no doubt, to the significant skills shortages that we are facing today. It was also reflected in their approach to the then-opposition and now-government's approach to increasing the minimum wage which had such a positive effect in the care economy. They said it would bring the sky falling down. They said it would be unaffordable. It hasn't been unaffordable; it's been absolutely critical to not only, firstly, helping people cope with cost of living but, secondly, for dealing with skills shortages. Of course, on this IR bill that this parliament is dealing with right now, which is so critical for the care economy, the opposition is fighting tooth and nail. They say that we need to do things immediately to deal with the skills shortages, that we need to do things immediately to deal with this sector, when, at every step of the way, they've had an incoherent policy, mixed messages and done everything they can to stand in front of and stop critical reforms.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our policy in this space was announced very early in the last term. It was the centrepiece of the then opposition leader's response to the 2020 budget. Those opposite rubbished it and now they say in this motion 'do it immediately'. It was motivated by a number of things, firstly the three Ps—productivity, participation and population—underpinning long-term and sustainable economic growth. It was also motivated to help women's participation in particular increase, recognising the fact that childcare subsidies at that point proved to be a barrier for so many and of course it recognised the fact that this is a critical reform when it comes to children's early education.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to quote extracts from the Grattan Institute's comparison of the two policies from the period leading up to the last election. Under the coalition policy, mothers with two children in long daycare can lose 100 per cent of the take-home pay they earn in the fourth or fifth day of work, largely due to childcare costs. Labor has lowered the disincentive rates, lowered the means test taper, which is significantly less steep than the coalition's. The steepness of the taper is one of the significant reforms of this policy and it dramatically increases the incentive for participation. Again, from the Grattan Institute's comparison of the two policies, Labor's policy is broader, it supports more families and it would have a much larger and more widespread economic benefit. It would also bring down out-of-pocket costs and sharpen workforce incentives for a much wider group of families. That backs up exactly what the Prime Minister said in his 2020 budget reply when he made this policy the centrepiece. It was a centrepiece back in 2020 and it is now one of the major reforms that we have implemented.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I've alluded to, this policy is buttressed by critical reforms likely the VET policies and investment in skills. Critically, it is buttressed by our policies in relation to skills and workforce conditions. It is only through all of those holistic approaches to this sector that, on the one hand, we're going to get more people working in it, and, on the other hand, we're going to reduce the taper rate and make it more affordable for a whole raft of families.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This reform is absolutely critical for families and for the broader macro economy at a time we are facing rising costs. This is one of our government's signature policies. For so many on our side, it was a matter of great pride when it passed through this parliament. It formed the centrepiece of the PM's response to the previous government's 2020 budget and is a centrepiece of this government's agenda. Now they say, 'We don't like it, but why haven't you implemented it immediately?' Well, Labor has achieved more in six months than the previous government did in a decade. It has legislated key childcare reform and is now responding to the skills and wages challenges.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BIRRELL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Nicholls</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Nationals Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:20</span>):  As a new member of this parliament, it's interesting the way the straw man argument is used when it comes to debating these things: 'Those opposite—they don't like what we've done; they don't like what we've done.' We actually supported the bill. When this parliament works really well, it is when offers of amendments and suggestions to improve existing bills get made, and I'd like to be part of that. But this motion doesn't say that the subsidy bill is a bad thing. This motion says that there could be improvements made to it, improvements to allow access, particularly in regional and rural areas, and improvements to create a workforce that can help us make sure that we can staff these places.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A report earlier this year from the Mitchell Institute showed that around one-third of Australian families, nine million Australians, live in a childcare desert—that's where you can't even get child care. I've been through this myself. When we had our first child, my wife wanted to get back into the workforce as soon as possible. We struggled to find a childcare place in Shepparton, and Shepparton's quite a large centre. We eventually got something, but, if we had have been out somewhere smaller in my electorate, such as Nathalia or Murchison, we would have had no options. That affects productivity. My wife, Lisa, who's a professional in the dairy industry, which is a critical industry to us, wouldn't have gone back to offer her skills to that particular industry. We're not saying that subsidies aren't important and that the substance of that part of the bill is bad; we are saying that we need to add to it by helping to create more childcare places, particularly in areas that don't have them, childcare deserts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've consulted with some people around my electorate on this subject. That's what you have to do as a local member. You go and say, 'Okay, this is the substance of what it is; what do you think?' Ronni Druitt is the CEO of the Goulburn Regional Pre School Association, which does a lot of this childcare stuff. Ronni said: 'You can quote me, Sam'—I should refer to myself as the member for Nicholls—'government can build as many childcare facilities as it wants, but the sector does not have any educators to fill roles. I had one childcare service in Cobram where I had room for an additional 20 children but could not offer those spots as I had limited staff.' She went on to say that places such as Avenel have no child care and that the closest child care is in Seymour, and it's full. Murchison, Rushworth and Colbinabbin don't have any child care at all. At Strathmerton, kinder is getting many enrolments, but there's no child care available in spots close. An amendment to this bill to address the childcare desert and to put some funding and incentives towards building some new facilities would be a great addition.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ronni Druitt also went on to tell me about the information available on the Australian Childcare Alliance, which is the apprenticeships incentives that the previous government put in place. She said that the incentive program was fantastic. They got a lot of apprentices and educators learning how to be childcare educators, but that ended on 30 June 2022. As far as we're aware, there's no ongoing funding for that. If someone can tell me that that program's going to continue, it's a program that the previous government put in place that people in my area are saying worked, that would be good to look into. We believe in child care not only because of the productivity that I talked about of having all sorts of people go back into the workforce but also because of the socialisation that those young people get. The future of work is understanding and empathising with each other's humanity, and being able to communicate with people and solve problems. You develop that as a young person by having interaction with other people. You become empathetic, you learn about their lives and learn about communicating with them and that happens in child care. I'm sure everyone here is very empathetic and all had good childcare experiences. The member for Hawke, I'm sure, would say that. We're not against child care. We just want more of it, particularly in parts of the country, like the one where I live, which are the regional and rural areas. We're supportive but there can be improvements. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Reid</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:25</span>):  I welcome the member for Nicholls' desire to reach across the aisle and work together on this because we can all agree that early education is really important for kids, for parents and for our society. So I say to the member for Nicholls: get on board. Get on board with our call for a minimum wage increase. Get on board with our Secure Jobs, Better Pay bill to ensure that we can have multi-employer bargaining. I say to him: get on board with our fee-free TAFE places and get on board with our 20,000 additional university places for those jobs in critical skills areas. We do have a plan and we think that the coalition should get on board. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to thank the member for Moncrieff for this bill because it gives us an opportunity to talk about the critical reform that the Albanese Labor government is bringing in to ensure that child care is more affordable for more families. It is a plan and a strategy that the then opposition leader committed to at the very beginning when he spoke in his budget reply speech about how important this piece of policy is for us. We just want to remind those opposite about the increasing costs of child care that they oversaw—41 per cent in eight years. That meant that it was more expensive for families. They were having to make decisions about the number of days that they would work and whether or not to go back to work at all. We want to make sure that we are making child care more affordable because we know it is good for kids, because they get access to that great early education. It's good for families because parents can decide to go back to work or pick up additional days. It's good for our economy because of the increased productivity. Early educators are absolutely critical to that. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I do welcome the coalition's recent desire to make the industry more attractive to our early educators. It's just a shame that they didn't show that interest when they were in government. They are right; we are facing a workforce shortage in the early education sector. But it's not something that has come about in the last six months since we've been in government. This is a workforce shortage and it has been brewing for quite some time. If we look at the qualifications that are required to be an early educator, a bachelor of early childhood education takes four years full-time; a cert III in early childhood education and care takes one year full-time. So even if, on 22 May, we did everything we could to attract more early educators to the sector, we still wouldn't have them in there at this point. The reforms needed to attract more people into this industry needed to happen years ago. Some of those key reforms that would have made it more attractive to early childhood educators would be to increase their wages. You would think that's a simple proposition—an increase to the minimum wage—but they refused to back that. You would think that having multi-employer bargaining to ensure that early educators were able to bargain for better pay and conditions would be a simple proposition for them to back but, again, they failed to back that. When they want to talk about the workforce shortage in early childhood education, where are the actions that match their rhetoric? They've gone missing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But I do want to thank them for some of the plans that we have now started to put into place to attract early educators to the sector—some of the plans that they created but never implemented. They are now part of our National Children's Education and Care Workforce Strategy Implementation and Evaluation Plan. Part of that will be practical steps and action to support the attraction and retention of staff and to improve the quality and sustainability of the workforce in this sector long term. We are also delivering almost 1,500 additional university places for early education teachers as well as fee-free TAFE places. This is going to make a real practical difference to the sector.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Petrie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:30</span>):  The Labor Party has been banging on about fee-free TAFE places for the best part of two decades. The reality is that every state Labor government—and at the federal level—come in and say, 'We're going to save TAFE,' and, four years on or eight years on, they're still trying to save TAFE, with no extra results. In my state of Queensland, I went out to the TAFE in Redcliffe the other day, and they're not even offering diploma-level courses at the moment. It's all certificate levels. I thank the member for Moncrieff, the shadow minister, for putting forward this motion today. One of the best things that we can do when, hopefully, one day the member for Moncrieff is the minister will be to cut red tape, because red tape kills small business and it makes it very difficult for providers. Red tape costs a lot of money, and that pushes up the cost of child care. I was talking to a provider in my electorate today about this, and they were telling me how much red tape was involved and what has to be sent off to the Department of Education in Queensland each week. I imagine it would be the same around the country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Child care is important. As a father of three sons, all now in their teenage years, I remember how important child care was when my wife was working even part time. We needed that child care when she was at work. It plays an important role in helping young kids develop the social skills to mix with other children.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition have a strong record in child care. Why? Because we doubled the amount of childcare investment to $11 billion in 2022-23. From March 2022 we provided a higher subsidy, of up to 95 per cent, for families with multiple children in early childhood care and education at once, which has helped with workforce participation and allowed cheaper access. The coalition also helped a lot of Australian families access more affordable child care by removing the annual cap on childcare subsidy. We saw women's workforce participation reach record highs of 62.3 per cent in May of this year, which was good news. Under the previous Labor government it was down in the high 50s. Under the coalition, 280,000 more children were in early childhood education.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently I hosted the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in my electorate. We had a roundtable for women. Invited guests were women leaders in my electorate, including people from business, including one from child care, education, faith communities, medicine—I had a couple of doctors there—digital marketing and fitness. They were women of different ages, different life experiences and different education levels. Everyone in the room was remarkable in their own right. And they didn't all vote a certain way. They were just people that I've met as the federal member for Petrie in my time in the job. For any federal member—as you'd know, Deputy Speaker—their job is to listen to what local people in their electorate are saying. The topic of child care was relatable for all the women in that room. There were women with young families, grandmothers, mothers with adult children but also women who were married without kids, and they could all understand what each of them were saying.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've spoken to childcare centres in my electorate, and they are struggling with regulations, as I explained before—red tape that is forcing up the cost of child care. So I'd say to the current government, but also the opposition, that that's something that does need to be improved. Many educators have raised low wages, mental health issues, no appreciation and the increase in red tape as their top concerns. I want to use this opportunity to thank every childcare provider in the electorate of Petrie and every childcare worker in the electorate of Petrie for what they do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In relation to the cost of living, we know that cost-of-living relief was needed, and it was a missed opportunity by the Albanese Labor government in their budget—a completely missed opportunity. They did nothing to help reduce the costs of living for people in my electorate each day, particularly since these changes don't even kick in until July next year. They expect people just to wait around another eight months. So I would say that the current government needs to do better. Six months into the job, time's up. It's no good blaming former governments or anything like that, like we see the current Prime Minister doing daily. It's time to step up and lead. Thank you.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="298800" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms MASCARENHAS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Swan</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:35</span>):  I want to speak today on the member for Moncrieff's motion firstly as the member for Swan but also as a mother of two children under the age of five. Like many Australian families, my husband and I work. We do our best to share the parenting duties and spend quality time with our children while balancing both of us having successful careers. With my new role as the member for Swan, there have been some challenges around being a fly-in fly-out parent. I'm very lucky to have an onsite early childhood education centre here at Parliament House. I would like to acknowledge the great work that the educators do here at Capital Hill Early Childhood Centre and all the work that early childhood educators do across Australia. For me, early childhood education is a matter that's very close to my heart.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When deciding on where their child should go, a parent has so many parameters to consider: when their child should start; the size of the waitlist; the proximity of the childcare centre to home or work; the skill level of educators; the physical surrounds and vibes; how many days their children need care; and, of course, the fees. For me, deciding on where my children would go to child care was one of the most emotional decisions I've had to make as a parent. I wanted to make sure that my children were in a place of love, learning and care and one that I could actually afford while returning to a demanding job.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Moncrieff talks of reforms that the previous government started in 2018. Well, my son started early childhood education in 2019, and I can say from personal experience that the reforms did not go far enough. I know that other mother groups across my electorate and in my state would concur. There are over 11,000 children that are aged under four in the electorate of Swan. These children belong to more than 7,600 families like mine, who strive to give their children the best start to their life. What we know is that childcare costs have gone up by 41 per cent over the last eight years, which was during the coalition's reign. Nationally, 73,000 people who wanted to work did not look for work because of the rising cost of early childhood education. So while I appreciate that the member for Moncrieff wants to note that the previous government tried to improve early childhood education, there shouldn't be a commendation for these efforts, because the numbers did not stack up—not for me as a parent, nor for those in my community. Early childhood education policy under the previous government simply was not good enough.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Under Labor's policy, 6,900 families—that's 90 per cent of families—in Swan will be better off. A family with a combined income of $120,000 will save $1,780 in the first year of our policy. And we got to work doing this in our first budget. We spoke to communities, listened and passed the cheaper child care act. We're not rushing this process, but we are acting quickly and working with providers and implementing changes to the childcare subsidy scheme. I know that the member for Moncrieff would have liked it to have been done earlier, but the truth is that the coalition had nine years of government where we saw childcare fees skyrocket while they racked up a national debt of almost a trillion dollars. They were elected in 2013 and took five long years to implement some reforms which simply did not go far enough. Meanwhile, the federal Labor government sees this as a targeted cost-of-living measure which is good for children, good for parents and good for the economy. When these changes are implemented, 90 per cent of families across Australia will get access to a greater childcare subsidy rate. The maths of this bill is simple, and this will go to families that work, study or are volunteering within their community. I thank the member for Moncrieff for allowing me and my colleagues the opportunity to share why Australians are better off under Labor's childhood education policy, and I look forward to seeing our proposed changes rolled out in July 2023.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This Friday, 50 years ago, on 2 December 1972, the Hon. Gough Whitlam led the Australian Labor Party into government. It was the first Labor government in 23 years. For my family, it was a time of hope for a better Australia. My mum and dad were always politically interested. They were excited that working-class people like them from the outer suburbs would have their voices elevated to the national stage. They lived in Mr Whitlam's electorate. Although young, I remember the change of hope for them then and the 'It's time' stickers on the car and my bike. Whitlam offered Australians a progressive vision, one that looked to a federal government that actively fixed the issues that faced the country. On that day, the Australian people gave Whitlam a mandate to implement that change. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This change affected other families, not just mine. I was talking to the member for Dobell, the Hon. Emma McBride, and she explained to me how the Whitlam government changed Australia and the life of her father, the late Hon. Grant McBride. Her uncle, Shaun, today confirmed a story that was told to Emma many years ago. It was Sunday morning, and he was reading the <span style="font-style:italic;">Nation Review</span> and spotted an advertisement for an electorate officer in Werriwa. It was after the dismissal, and he said to her dad, 'Don't just talk about it; do something about it'. Her dad, maintaining the enthusiasm and the rage, applied for the role. He was culled by Whitlam's private secretary, as he didn't have the necessary experience. But, as the story goes, Whitlam hadn't worked with an engineer before, so Grant, a young man from housing commission in Dundas Valley who worked three jobs to support himself through uni, was now working for a former PM who made education free. It instilled in him a belief that politics, although flawed, is the way that people without connections or resources can change the country. The McBride family are deeply grateful for the chance that Gough took on their dad.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The social and economic program that was taken to the 1972 election was broad and far reaching, yet it was captured in the simple and famous slogan, 'It's time.' It was time for Australia to move on from economic and political stagnation, and it was time for Australia to establish itself in the Pacific and throughout the world. That was one of the legacies of the Whitlam government. In the three short years of his government, he radically transformed the Australian economy and laid the foundation for what is modern-day Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It can't be understated how significant the Whitlam era was for Australia, because Whitlam believed that government programs could improve the conditions of everyday Australians, and he delivered on those ambitions. Within the first few weeks of government, Whitlam and the deputy prime minister Lance Barnard ended conscription, established diplomatic relations with China, reopened an equal-pay case and withdrew all remaining troops from Vietnam. In its first year, his government passed 203 bills. The domestic policies of the Whitlam era elevated Australians all over the country. It saw the complete restructuring of the relationship between government and education. Whitlam oversaw the abolition of university fees and an increase in government spending to state schools by 677 per cent whilst he was attempting to close the gap between private and public schools.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was under the Whitlam government that we saw the introduction of non-discriminatory immigration rules and the Racial Discrimination Act and the enthusiastic pursuit of multiculturalism—something that we see all over Australia today but particularly in the electorate of Werriwa that he represented.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was the Whitlam government that improved our suburbs, whether they be in south-west Sydney or across Australia. The legacy of the Whitlam government can be felt across south-west Sydney. He was the first and so-far only Prime Minister to come from our part of the world and we are very proud of that. His legacy is echoed throughout the area I represent. There are buildings and parks named in his honour. The Whitlam Institute houses the Whitlam Prime Ministerial Collection of more than 35,000 objects and is a centre of ideas and political engagement. The Whitlam government was the foundation of the modern Labor Party and I take pride in the accomplishments of his government. We remember a Labor government that truly uplifted the people of Australia, that established Australia in our region and in the world and that changed us all forever.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BROADBENT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Monash</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:45</span>):  I thank the member for Werriwa for her outline of a great, changing time in Australia, when the Whitlam government was elected after many years of conservative governments. But there's always more to the story. I've never put this on record and today is the day I want to put it on record. At that time, when the Whitlam government was elected, I had just opened my first retail store, which sold fabrics and knitting wool, and I was also the lead singer, manager and owner of a band called the Trutones. Through Barry Simon, whom I was close to at the time—he lived in my district and was the member for McMillan—we were asked to do Billy McMahon's event. He said, 'Would you come along and be the entertainment for Billy McMahon at the Malvern Town Hall?' I said, 'Yes, I will. Of course I will.' We went along and did that and we saw all the ministers. It was my first exposure to politics. I think John Howard was actually standing beside Billy moving the speech notes as he went through. This was all new for me. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A few weeks later, after the election, we were the house band at the new Palais and we were there when Gough and Margaret walked in to the victory celebration in Melbourne. But there was an issue—there's always more to the story. One of the fabrics in my store was a beautiful seersucker, a tartan hot-pink and lime check material—it was beautiful at the time. I'd noticed this fabric in my shop and I said, 'Righto. I'll go to dressmaker and I'll make an outfit for the whole band,' which I did. It was fantastic. We had the bow tie, we had the pink trousers, we had the pink shirt, we had the seersucker jacket and we had the great high-heeled boots—I think they were white or pink; I'm not sure what colour they were. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span class="HPS-GeneralInterjecting">An honourable member:</span>  Have you still got them?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="MT4" type="MemberContinuation">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr BROADBENT:</span>
                  </a>  No, I haven't. They go off to parties with my sons and never come home. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So here we are. We've got our outfits on and Gough and Margaret are about to walk into the room. There's one big problem: Margaret Whitlam walks in and her long frock is made out of the material that I'm wearing. So I said to the boys one by one: 'You stop playing now and you take your jacket off, then you take your jacket off, then you take your jacket off, and then you take your jacket off.' Now, we weren't the only ones. There was a woman standing there in the audience—and there were 700 people there; it was huge—and she'd made herself a dress too. And she looked at Margaret Whitlam and Margaret Whitlam looked at her, and she went straight out the back door—obviously, to go home to change her clothes because Margaret had this on. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to say to you: Gough Whitlam was really good to me as an unknown backbencher. He actually knew all of us. I walked into the parliament one day. There was a major function on, and Gough and Margaret were walking beside Bronwyn and me. We got ourselves in the wrong place for the official things to come through, and Gough said to me—to me, an unknown—'Russell, come over here and stand beside me. You won't be noticed; it's all right.' And, of course, we were in the absolute spotlight at that function. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He was so genuine and generous to people around him. He knew them and he actually cared what they thought, and he took a real interest in this parliament long after his days as Prime Minister of this country. I can only honour that. Margaret was always so kind to us as well. However people want to paint that particular government and whatever the chaos that went on in those times, they are probably reflective of the Australian community and where we were at. But as far as the man and the woman went, there was such generosity, such wisdom and such knowledge. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">He may have been let down by a few of his own, but it wasn't of his own making. I repeat: it wasn't of his own making. This man stood tall and, like very few in the parliament, he commanded the parliament. As Menzies had commanded the parliament. As had, in more recent times, Paul Keating—and perhaps John Howard was his comfort in the parliament, knowing the parliament. There are very few people who come into the House, and I'm getting the Library to check how many have gone out of the house since I arrived—it's a great number of members have left the lower house since that time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The theme was 'It's Time', and for Australia it was time. We did change, and the ramifications of that government still continue through the policies and the actions of governments of today. I thank you for the opportunity to share that story with you.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Chisholm</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:50</span>):  I don't think it's dramatic to say that if it weren't for Gough Whitlam I would not be here today, because it was the Whitlam government, elected 50 years ago on 2 December, that opened the door of opportunity for my family—for the generations that came before me and that allowed the doors of opportunity to open for me and to bring me to this place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've told this story before, but it's one that I think about often because of how significant it is to my trajectory and to the trajectories of those who come from families like mine. After the Second World War decimated Italy and Europe, my grandparents, like many other Italians and Greeks at the time, made the decision to come to Australia to find a better future. When they arrived they found that things were tough. They worked gruelling hours in difficult jobs in factories, needing two incomes to raise their families, often sharing homes other families because they did not make enough to get by.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My grandfather, my nonno, had been a promising student in Italy, but his education was cut short by war and poverty. When Gough Whitlam became Prime Minister he opened the door for people like my nonno to go to university. My nonno became a teacher and not only was he able to realise his professional ambition, but he was able to realise his ambition for his family: to build a comfortable life and to ensure his kids had access to opportunity and a great education. There is no question that my life has been easier because of the way access to education has now been opened up for so many Australians. This is largely a legacy of the Whitlam years. This education has equipped me to make contributions to my community and I'm honoured to be able to do that as the member for Chisholm.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is my greatest ambition that every single person in Australia is able to access the highest-quality education to pursue the path that they choose and for however long I am here and have the enormous, incredible honour of representing the people of Chisholm, I'll work hard towards this goal. The achievements of the Whitlam government are considerable, and they shaped the country we are today in profound ways. The first universal health system in Australia was instituted by the Whitlam government. And although those opposite have gotten rid of it before, and unfortunately consistently undermine it, Medicare and the idea that every single Australian should be able to get health care when they need it, is part of our psyche. It is part of the fair go we as Australians rightly and proudly champion. Labor will always, always defend it, and I know how important the legacy of universal health care is to our communities. My parents were both health workers and I was raised to believe in the idea that no matter your economic circumstances, the right to health care is one everyone should have.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My community in Chisholm is a vibrant, multicultural one. I cannot imagine an Australia that is not diverse. And Gough Whitlam's role in looking to the world and wanting our wonderful nation to be part of an international community and to embrace our neighbours is a terrific legacy. Establishing diplomatic relations with China is an important achievement from that time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Gough Whitlam dismantled the White Australia Policy, something I'm sure we're all very pleased he did. I'm sure we can all recognise that this was a terrible and quite shameful policy for us to have had at all. It was the Whitlam government that established a policy of multiculturalism and we are all, in communities across Australia, grateful recipients of the legacy of this policy. I know my electorate is richer for the contributions of migrant communities and it is part of what makes our area such a wonderful place to live. It is impossible to celebrate the achievements of the Whitlam government in a short speech but, suffice to say, the Australia we know was shaped by Whitlam. Our national anthem and our sense of pride in a nation that can stand on its own were fostered by Gough Whitlam and his government. It was the Whitlam government that changed our anthem to <span style="font-style:italic;">Advance Australia Fair</span> and launched construction of the National Gallery of Australia. We became a modern, proud nation that celebrated our diversity and extended opportunity, a fair go, to all under Prime Minister Whitlam.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We all benefit from the legacies of the Whitlam government, and I'm proud to be part of another Labor government. I hope in 50 years, after a long time in government, we can look back and know that Australia was made better, fairer and stronger for the decisions we made. I will try my hardest and I know that my colleagues in the Labor government will too, and for this to be the case every single day.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr LIM</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tangney</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:56</span>):  I thank the member for Werriwa for moving this motion. I want to talk about my hero, Gough Whitlam. Today, on the 50th anniversary of the election of the Whitlam government, I want to honour the enduring legacy of Gough Whitlam on Australian politics and Australian society. Gough Whitlam's three-year term is known as one of Australia's most reformative and progressive governments. Many of the institutions that our nation is known for, institutions that have become enshrined as rights for Australians, are thanks to Gough. Gough was daring, he dreamt big, he looked over the horizon and he pushed for what was right, not what was easy. He achieved so much in his three-year term. Gough was a person who showed that there can and should be decency, integrity and heart in politics. I can see in our leader Prime Minister Anthony Albanese parallels with Gough Whitlam—hard work, advocating for others, fighting for a fairer Australia. He has achieved a great deal on a short amount of time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If it had not been Gough Whitlam, I may not be standing before you today. That is because in 1973 Gough Whitlam abolished the white Australia policy. In this place the Gough Whitlam Labor government created and supported the policy of multiculturalism. Because of this, Australia is now home to people from nearly 200 different countries. My electorate of Tangney is home to over 160 nationalities. This diversity reaches our electorates. I consider it a blessing to connect with people from so many different places. My community and my life are richer and more vibrant for it. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to recognise the Whitlam Labor government's reform in health care. This is a matter close to my heart because, had it not been for Gough Whitlam, my daughter may not be here today. In 2006 my eldest daughter, Ying, was diagnosed with cancer. It was a long, hard road for her and our family but she won her battle with cancer. I credit this to our amazing healthcare system, the foundation which is Medicare. My family was under so much stress during that time, I cannot imagine the added financial stress if Medicare wasn't available to us. I recognise Gough Whitlam as the champion for Medibank, which evolved into the system we know as Medicare today. Gough saw that, in a country as wealthy as Australia, no-one should go without access to basic health care. Medicare is upheld as a right for Australian people and is considered a building block for one of the best healthcare systems in the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to acknowledge the Whitlam Labor government's contribution to education. To me, education is everything. Like any parent, I want my children to have the best possible opportunity they can in their lives. This was the reason why my wife and I decided to emigrate to Australia in 2002—to give our children the best education. In the words of Gough himself, education is the key to equality of opportunity. These words resonate deeply with me. I grew up poor in rural Malaysia. My family didn't have electricity or running water but I'm very grateful to have had access to a quality education. Equal access to opportunities is so important. I know that, without access to education, equality is impossible. After the 1972 election, the Whitlam Labor government made education free. Participation in higher education rose by 25 per cent under Whitlam. I have spoken with many people who say that they owe their university degree to Gough. They say that free tertiary education had a direct impact on their opportunities in life and the path their life has taken. It impacted the way they saw themselves and their capability. Gratitude for Gough and his legacy persists within me and the Australian public. He has left a lasting mark on Australians. Thank you, Gough, we will not forget you. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moreton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:00</span>):  Gough Whitlam was a formidable, charismatic man with a large presence and a vision for Australia that remains with us today. I thank the member for Werriwa for bringing this motion forward. The Whitlam government policy redefined our nation and changed the lives of a generation of Australians, as we've heard from earlier speakers. Former Prime Minister Kevin Rudd said, 'Labor governments build things while conservatives tear things down.' It's a simple but clear description of the two sides of politics. Paul Keating said, 'When you change the government, you change the country.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Whitlam government did both and had a lasting impact on many Australians' lives. That government's policies transformed individual lives and transformed our nation for the better. Matt Foley, a constituent of mine from Fairfield, who also happens to have been the Attorney-General and Minister for the Arts in the Goss government, was in the United Kingdom when Whitlam was elected. Matt says: 'The world was changing. Women wanted equal rights. There was a war in Vietnam that was deadly and bloody and nobody sensible wanted it. The Whitlam government was a breath of fresh air after 23 years of conservative rule.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Matt Foley came back to Australia in January the following year to complete his studies in social work.  He said it was a stirring time for people working in social work. The Whitlam government set up legal aid centres and had a profound vision for making justice accessible. While working for the Aboriginal legal services, Matt recalls the honest approach Whitlam had to Aboriginal land rights. At the launch of his 1972 election campaign, Gough Whitlam said:</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">We will legislate to give Aboriginal land rights—because all of us as Australians are diminished while the Aborigines are denied their rightful place in this nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And the image of Whitlam handing over title deeds at Daguragu to Vincent Lingiari of the Gurindji people is now iconic. It was the first time the Commonwealth government had returned land to its original custodians. The government set up a royal commission to investigate suitable ways to recognise Aboriginal land rights in the Northern Territory. However, while the Whitlam government drafted the first Commonwealth legislation to grant land rights to Aboriginal peoples, it was dismissed before the legislation could pass the Senate. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">John Lincoln, another constituent, turned 30 back in 1972. He was married, a Mormon, and had always voted conservative. He accompanied a friend to the Moorooka Bowls Club because his friend's number was up for the lottery for selective conscription to Vietnam. Thankfully, his friend's number did not come up that day and his friend collapsed on the floor in relief. Like many young men, John Lincoln had no desire to fight against a country Australia had no quarrel with. The next day John heard Gough Whitlam announce that, if elected, he would bring the troops home from Vietnam, so on 5 December 1972, John voted Labor for the first time, and the Whitlam government filled John's life with many opportunities. Whitlam freed all imprisoned draft resisters and brought the Australian troops home from Vietnam. John Lincoln had missed out on higher education but then obtained a teaching degree for free. When his marriage broke down he was able to divorce, sensibly, thanks to Whitlam's reforms under the Family Law Act. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ken and Robin Boyne, from Yeronga, are retired teachers and constituents of mine. In the 1970s, they were in their mid-20s and wanted to become primary school teachers. They studied teacher training for three years and then commenced work in the Queensland state education system—a decision made possible by the Whitlam government when it expanded access to tertiary education. Without this access, Ken and Robin, who were then supporting a young son, would not have been able to study full time and maintain a household. Having access to publicly funded universal health care, via the Whitlam era Medibank, was also a great boon to Ken and Robin as they set out to establish a family home while being full-time students. Ken and Robin have never forgotten the support they received under the Whitlam initiatives and continue to make their contributions to the broader community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My first political memory is from when I was nine years old. On 11 November 1975, Sister Mary came rushing into our classroom that afternoon and told Mrs Picking, our teacher, to listen to the radio as something awful was happening. Indeed, something awful was happening: the dismissal of the Whitlam government, in a coup and in an affront to constitutional democracy. I would hate for people to be supporting such a thing. Governments are elected to do good things for the country. Gough Whitlam had a vision for Australia. It was a vision that lifted a generation of people out of poverty and transformed this nation. I'm a beneficiary of the Whitlam government, raised by a single mother in regional Queensland. In 1983 my mother could not have afforded to give me a tertiary education but for the Whitlam government's abolition of university fees and providing income support for poorer people. Thank you, Gough Whitlam and your government, for the changes you made to this nation.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="176304" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr STEVENS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Sturt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:05</span>):  I rise to make some comments on the 50th anniversary of the election of the Whitlam government. Indeed, that was more than 10 years before I was born, but there's no doubt that Gough Whitlam leaves an enormous legacy of good achievements and wary lessons for modern governments—particularly this Labor government—to take heed of.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Firstly, I acknowledge also that it's the 50th anniversary of my predecessor Ian Wilson winning the seat of Sturt back for the Liberal Party. I think it was the only seat the Liberals won at the 1972 election and, to be fair—nothing against Ian—that was on the back of a significant redistribution of the seat. However, it was recorrecting it back to the seat that he'd represented earlier before losing to a nice chap called Norm Foster. Norm Foster was the Labor member for Sturt for three years and then became a South Australian legislative councillor for the Labor Party. He resigned from the party to cross the floor and support the establishment of the Olympic Dam mine, which provides such an enormous economic bounty for my state of South Australia. The Labor Party bitterly opposed its development, but Norm Foster was prepared to leave the Labor Party over that because he understood the significant opportunity that Olympic Dam would provide, and has provided, to South Australia for the decades in between.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Whitlam government did good things, but, of course, it was a short-term government. After being out of power for 23 years, the Labor Party came back for three short years. Bob Hawke was the one who said in interviews he's given that, in hindsight, whilst the Whitlam government did excellent things in social reform and in the wide variety of things they were focused on, credible, stable, strong economic management was not one of them. That was certainly what brought that government undone. In some ways, it was beyond just poor economic management. There was the spectre of ministers operating outside of the authority of the parliament, in seeking to raise, and commit the Commonwealth to, loans without the authority of the legislature. That authority is absolutely fundamental to our Constitution and the supremacy of the parliament and ensures that no-one can act in the name of the Commonwealth of Australia, particularly on financial matters, without the approval of the parliament.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ministers in the Whitlam government, as we know—Rex Connor and Jim Cairns—sought to do exactly that. They sought to go out and raise billions of dollars of loans—that's billions of dollars in the seventies, I might add, so it was what, in the modern era, would be hundreds of billions of dollars—without the approval of the parliament and without, sometimes, the then Secretary to the Treasury, Sir Frederick Wheeler, even knowing about it. It was a very reckless time. My grandparents went into retirement; my grandfather retired in 1975. Unfortunately, the legacy of that Whitlam government, particularly on inflation—and there are some interesting parallels here—was a massive destructive force on the savings of Australians. The impact of inflation through the seventies, because of the recklessness of those economic decisions, was seriously brutal on retirees in this country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's an important watchword for today. With inflation tipped to hit eight per cent in the government's budget, this is really going to impact, as it did in the Whitlam era, the savings and the economic security of Australians—particularly Australians on fixed incomes who think that they have provisioned for their future. That will be pulled out from under them if inflation is let loose in our economy. That happened at the tail end of the Whitlam era.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was three tumultuous years, with a lot of reform which I absolutely acknowledge has been excellent for the nation, including things that are enduring to this day, particularly in health and education. But I just hope the Labor government of today, in recalling and remembering the Whitlam government of 50 years ago, think about what they would do differently if they were a part of the Whitlam government and apply some of those principles to the government that they are a part of right now, because there are significant challenges and forces—economically, in particular—that are coming down the railway line to us in this country. We wish any government well in meeting those challenges. The Whitlam approach would not be the one I'd recommend. In fact, thinking very seriously about Bob Hawke's critique of the Whitlam government is what we'd love to see this government do to take on the challenges that this government faces, which are very similar to those the Whitlam government faced.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">On entering this parliament, my background was of well over 20 years in business, much of that spent negotiating international deals, particularly throughout the Asia-Pacific. I think I was 21 when I first led an international joint venture negotiation based up in Asia. Throughout all of those years of doing negotiations, I never once had the opportunity, the fun, of facing across the table somebody as incompetent and suffering from eternal cluelessness as this government's Minister for Climate Change and Energy. I sat across the table from many a wily negotiator, but never did I have the pleasure of facing somebody as hopeless as this minister. This is the minister who represented Australia and negotiated on our behalf at COP27 in Egypt. You can just imagine the shrewd operators who were leading negotiations from other countries and how excited they would have been when they saw this minister coming—a minister all excited, jumping in front of every camera he could, claiming Australia was back and we had money to give away. And that was precisely a mission that he lived up to at that conference.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also don't know who's cunning plan it was—which country—to convince the United Nations to tap this minister on the shoulder to facilitate negotiations about a loss-and-damage fund. But it was a clever move and a move that worked, because, again, they knew that this minister would jump at the opportunity and give away everything he could—and indeed that's what he did. True to form, he negotiated on Australia's behalf a loss-and-damage scheme which is effectively a compensation scheme, a scheme into which Australia, as well as other developed nations, will pour money, and it will be drawn down upon by developing nations. But, as the great negotiator—as, indeed, the architect of the loss-and-damage scheme—this Labor minister cannot tell us what's in it. This government cannot tell us the cost of the loss-and-damage fund. Reports suggest it will cost up to US$2 trillion annually up to 2030, yet this minister cannot tell us how much it' quick save turn sleep s going to cost. What's more, he cannot tell the Australian people how much Australia will be contributing to that fund. Of course, it was the same conference where the minister happily signed Australia up to the global methane pledge. Again, no work was done—no homework—in understanding what this will cost and what the demands will be on Australian industry, especially farmers with livestock. This is the ongoing business model of this new government, and it causes great concern to Australian industry and households.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Right now, Australia is amidst an energy crisis. We all know that for the last six months industry has been on its knees because of skyrocketing prices. Families are heading into Christmas deeply concerned about what to do about power bills. As an opposition, we've been calling on the government for six months. This same minister—who is very happy to go overseas on an act of blank-cheque diplomacy and sign Australia up to deals overseas for which he's done no homework and cannot answer any questions—has ignored the plight of Australian industry and Australian households. Still to this day, the government have no plan to address these problems. They've been saying for six months that a plan is being baked up; a plan will come forward. Meanwhile Australian households suffer and they pay, and they are bound to be paying billions of dollars through this loss-and-damage fund.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="265970" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr JOSH WILSON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fremantle</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:16</span>):  Wow! At the end of a long year, in the last week of parliament, this motion really is something. It's a waste of time, because it's fundamentally hollow and, frankly, it is silly in the extreme. It is utterly without substance. The basic assertions and assumptions are wrong. The whole thing depends on cooked-up fearmongering and false claims. I genuinely wonder whether the member for Fairfax really believes some of the rhubarb he is trying to peddle here today. In essence, this motion and the embarrassing questions advanced in question time by coalition members last week are designed to whip up some kind of political advantage from misunderstanding and disingenuousness and xenophobia. That is all there is to it, and I reckon that Australians are thoroughly sick of that at the end of what's been quite a long year. I reckon Australians have had a gutful of that kind of dishonest and lazy political game playing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The essential falsehood in this motion is that the Australian government has signed some kind of blank cheque, and that is wrong. That is a falsehood. That's what the motion says, and it's a lie. It's a lie. The motion says that the Australian government has already made a pledge of a funding scheme, and that is a lie. That is not true. The member said that this is a compensation fund. It is expressly not a compensation fund. That is a lie. This motion demands answers to questions that don't exist. How much has been pledged? No pledges have been made by Australia or by any other country. It is expressly not a compensation fund. But all of this is designed to create a cloud of bulldust that might trigger people into believing that sensible international cooperation in the global effort against climate change is actually a secret plot that seeks to penalise Australia. Sadly, all of this is born of a coalition that was hopeless and desperate in its dying days of government and yet, apparently, remains hopeless and desperate to this very day.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The truth is that the Australian government, along with many of our best and most sensible allies—the US, the UK and the EU—have agreed to a framework for ensuring that developed countries can help provide support to developing countries in dealing with the impact of climate change. That's what this fund is about. It's no different from the way Australia supports climate related measures in our region. It's no different, in essence, from the Green Climate Fund that the coalition government signed up to in 2016. It's the kind of assistance that reflects our character and promotes our national interest, especially with respect to the support we provide for nations that comprise our Pacific friends and neighbours. It's the kind of assistance that you should absolutely provide, even if you're taking the most selfish perspective possible, because it will help ensure resilience and stability and peace and trade and economic self-sufficiency in our region, all of which is to Australia's benefit.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This morning I attended a gathering as part of the Pacific Australian Emerging Leaders Summit. Needless to say, the issue of responding co-operatively to the impacts of climate change and the concept of climate justice was mentioned by everyone who spoke. Minister Conroy's statement that the Australian government will provide an additional $900 million to the Pacific, over four years, in development assistance with a focus on climate change was welcomed by all. Shadow minister McCormack said that he agreed with and endorsed every part of that approach.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In stark contrast to that bipartisan common sense, this motion peddles the idea that supporting climate action in the Pacific somehow penalises Australia. What's almost funny, in amongst all the falsehoods, bad faith and climate denialist dog whistling of this motion, is the suggestion that the coalition is somehow interested in carefully managed budgets and carefully applied taxpayers money. Give me a break. These are the jokers who burned billions of dollars in their awful mismanagement of the French submarine project. These are the jokers who wasted more than $19 billion in JobKeeper payments to companies whose profits rose during the pandemic; $2.6 billion went to companies whose turnover more than doubled in the relevant period. If the particular flavour of your funding waste outrage was in relation to money sent overseas, don't forget that some of the largest recipients of those wasted JobKeeper billions were foreign companies with foreign shareholders who pocketed the lazy, incompetent largess gifted by those opposite. You talk about shrewd operators. You talk about money to give away and cunning plans. Bloody have a good look at yourselves, for God's sake.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While the motion seeks to whip up anger out of misunderstanding and xenophobia and small mindedness, the reality is that after a decade of climate denialism and the clownish ineptitude of those opposite, the Albanese Labor government is returning Australia to its historical position and its historical character and values as a cooperative, supportive, influential middle power. That's who we are and, without question, that is in our national interest. </span>

                  </a>  If Australia produces 1.6 per cent of global carbon emissions, then presumably Australia's contribution to the loss-and-damage fund will be upwards of $16 billion per annum. This is economic insanity. It's communism 101. It is distributing wealth from this country to give to another: countries such as India, Brazil, Mexico, Indonesia, Argentina, Iran and even China, as well as Columbia, who claims an absurd $800 billion a year for loss and damage—a claim roughly 2.5 times its GDP. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The loss-and-damage fund is all based upon an unproven theoretical hypothesis which relies on computer modelling that has no correlation to real world data. How can these climate change policies change the climate when global carbon emissions continually rise? Why do you pretend that our weather patterns have become more threatening when historical records do not reflect this? </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Pagan tribes sacrificed virgins to appease the gods, and the Labor Albanese government, led by Chris Bowen, will sacrifice Australia's affluence, countless jobs and reliable power to appease the angry climate zealots. This is the pinnacle of economic madness. Minister Bowen has led a charge, committing Australia to an unknown future expense with little regard for the Australian people and the services they rely on. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While they're happy to distribute the wealth of Australia, according to the Australian Medical Association budget papers have revealed $2.4 billion is being cut from public hospitals over the next four years. What this government are saying is they're happy to pluck $2.4 billion out of our hospitals and give it a nations such as China, the world's second-largest economy and the single-largest carbon emitter. They're happy to take money away from hardworking Australians that are hurting every time they go to the supermarkets, pay their electricity bills or fuel up their cars. This is a disgrace and it's an absolute example of hypocrisy and pious virtue signalling.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the October budget, the Labor government committed $45.8 million over six years for international engagement on climate change issues, including the bid to host a Conference of the Parties in partnership with Pacific islands. There are Pacific nations who are supporting China. Their reason? Australia is not doing enough to support climate change. This while China is the biggest carbon emitter and is not signatory to any of these climate policies. The hypocrisy is staggering, and you can't make this stuff up. Are the entire Labor Party morons? I want to see what madness will come out of their mouths to justify this lunacy. It seems Minister Bowen is willing to concede tens of billions of dollars through the loss-and-damages facility to win critical support for his campaign to host a COP meeting in Australia. If this is the case, how about he hosts the COP meeting at Gladstone, in my electorate of Flynn, and he can explain to the people and the families there how he intends to shut down their industries, take their hard-earned dollars and give them to another country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government can't continue signing Australia up to international fund pledges where there is no detail and it has no mandate and which there is no plan to deliver. The coalition didn't sign up a methane pledge. Signing this pledge goes against getting the agriculture sector to grow to $100 billion by 2030. Mr Bowen told the Australian livestock sector that the pledge carries little meaning but told the rest of the world how meaningful that pledge is—a prime example of saying one thing overseas and another in regional Australia. This is after Labor promised the Australian people that they would not introduce a carbon or methane tax. At a time when families are struggling with the cost of energy and mortgage repayments, this tax on the grazing industry will only push up the price of food.</span>

I'll quote the member from the opposition who just spoke. Ancient societies 'sacrificed virgins', which apparently is the equivalent of acting on climate change. 'Why do you pretend that our weather patterns are becoming more threatening?' I don't know; because they have? Because since the 1980s we've seen an 80 per cent increase in destructive climate-related weather events? I don't know—science? Bye-bye, cooker; see you later. That was like standing on the Mulgrave polling booth in the Victorian election on Saturday. That was just completely bonkers. I'm going to video-clip that bloke and advertise him every day into Victoria and we might win even more seats. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a nasty, bizarre little motion. It's like a series of Sky News talking points and conspiracy theories vomited onto the parliamentary <span style="font-style:italic;">Notice Paper</span>. As the previous speaker, the member for Fremantle, said, it's a 'cloud of bulldust'. It's wrong, it's false, it's nonsensical and it's misinformation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But let's cut the rubbish. Let's call out in plain English what they're actually trying to say with all their fancy words that they're bandying about. They're trying to say: 'The government are a bunch of woke sell-outs because they believe in climate change, and they just signed a sneaky globalist agreement to give trillions of dollars to China and a bunch of other poor countries where coloured people live. Please be very angry, because the government didn't splash cash in the budget, like we did, and push up interest rates.' That's what it boils down to. It's complete nonsense. All that's missing are chemtrails, antivax mandates, gender theory and globalism. Go and talk to your Liberal Party mates in Victoria and see how well that went on the weekend. What I heard then is exactly the kind of nonsense that the Victorian Liberal Party, who just got smashed, are on about.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Some have, perhaps unkindly, compared the member for Fairfax to Mr Sheen—an unfortunate resemblance. Mr Sheen, as the saying goes, cleans, shines and protects. The member for Fairfax smears, sullies and discredits with this motion. The good thing is, though, it's so broad that I can make a few points in response. Member for Fairfax, science is real, climate change is real, and we need to actually do something about that. Australia can't fix the problem alone, because we share the climate with other humans in other countries. We need to work together with other countries. That's why we go to COP27, to talk about what we can do together.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The loss-and-damage fund is about developed countries helping developing countries. It's not about reparations and compensation. Even if you don't care about the increase in natural disasters; even if you don't care, member for Fairfax, that more than 90 per cent of deaths—that's right, other human beings dying; I don't think that registers the empathy bypass over there—all happen in developing countries; even if you don't care about the fate that awaits the poorest on the planet for their societies and economies from runaway climate change, it's in Australia's national interest to collaborate. We're the developed country most exposed in the world to climate change. Australians will bear the brunt of runaway bushfires, out-of-control floods, desertification and salinity creeping across our continent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's Australia, though, that has the most to gain of any developed country in a zero-carbon world. We have the best resources. We can bring back manufacturing onshore, member for Fairfax, in this zero-carbon world, and it's critical for a stable region. Let's be blunt: it's cheaper and better to provide aid and assistance to other countries to manage their transition than it is to commit military bases and combat failed states on our doorstep. Do you want to talk about security? That's a security threat. So, instead of carping and spreading your conspiracy theories via the national parliament, I would encourage the opposition to take this seriously, unlike the Victorian liberals.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">An agreement is not a contract to pay money. Any funding into the loss-and-damage fund will be a matter for future negotiations between parties, as you've been told. And your scare campaign about Labor giving money to China, as you well know, is nonsense. You're relying on a list from 1992 of countries that were then considered developing countries. As you well know, because you've been told, no money is going into that fund until there's a new list of developing countries. If you think that this country is going to give money to China, you're as bonkers as your colleague who spoke before you and, no doubt, those who are going to come after you. You can see them sitting in tactics: 'I know, we'll whip up a scare campaign with the Chinese community.' Just pathetic! You are the lowest form of grub I've seen—</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Capricornia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:32</span>):  Unfortunately, at COP27, we saw the Albanese Labor government's blank cheque to diplomacy in full swing. Unfortunately, the same generosity that the Prime Minister and the Minister for Climate Change and Energy are showing to countries overseas is not being shown to Australian citizens. While his government has ruled out support for Australian families and businesses struggling with skyrocketing power prices, as forecast in the federal budget, the Prime Minister and the Minister for Climate Change and Energy have happily handed over a blank cheque to other nations through a compensation scheme for which there is no detail.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With nations such as China, the world's second-largest economy and single-largest carbon emitter, angling to be a recipient of such funding, it's no wonder many are scared and unsure of what this means for their hip pocket. The Minister for Climate Change and Energy continues to be proud of himself for being the architect of the loss-and-damage fund but can't explain how much it will cost or who will pay and when. All we know is that this is set to cost upwards of US$2 trillion by 2030 and could cost tens of billions of dollars for Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister and the Minister for Climate Change and Energy also signed Australia up to 30 per cent reduction of methane emissions by 2030 at COP27. They told Australia's livestock sector that the pledge claims little meaning but told the rest of the world how meaningful that pledge is. This is after Labor promised the Australian people that they would not introduce a methane tax. Cattle producers in Capricornia are still unsure what this will mean for them. My office continues to receive correspondence from farmers who are afraid that they will be slugged with another tax and another penalty for existing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor are trying to walk both sides of the street, and the coalition are calling on them to be upfront with the Australian people. We saw the Labor Party give mixed messaging exactly like this in 2019, when they couldn't decide whether they liked coalmining or not or whether they supported the Adani coalmine in Capricornia. We have also seen them flip-flop on the Rockhampton Ring Road in my electorate. The federal government blamed cost blowouts and the Queensland government not being able to deliver the project fast enough, while the Queensland government blamed the federal government for not delivering the funding fast enough.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The opposition has been very upfront with the Australian public in ruling out the coalition 's support for this so-called compensation. This government can't continue signing Australia up to international pledges and funds for which there is no detail, for which it has no mandate and where there is no plan to deliver. Unlike the government, we believe in practical solutions and in having clarity on where the funding goes. This is why we favour bilateral assistance to the Pacific island nations, not signing a blank cheque to the United Nations for a huge fund which no-one knows the details of. At COP26, the coalition doubled its climate finance commitment to $2 billion over the period from 2020 to 2025, with at least $700 million of this for Pacific climate and disaster finance. We scored runs on the board at home too. Our government saw more than $40 billion invested in renewable energy since 2017. Since 2005, emissions fell by more than 20 per cent while our economy grew by 54 per cent. We also beat our Kyoto era targets by 459 million tonnes. Our government also reduced emissions faster than Japan, New Zealand, Canada and the OECD average.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government still has no plans to reduce power bills for households and businesses, despite misleading the public and telling everyone that they did. On 97 occasions the Prime Minister promised your power bill would go down by $275. He was adamant he would deliver. Just this fortnight, the CEFC, Origin and the RBA have all raised concerns about the increasing costs associated with Labor's accelerated transition. Even Dan Walton from the Australian Workers Union has warned that 800,000 jobs are at risk due to the soaring price of energy if Labor does not act. What's more, Labor has been caught out by its own budget papers, which revealed Labor's plan to see your electricity bill go up by more than 56 per cent over the next two years. It is not only electricity, though. Your gas bill will also go up by more than 44 per cent. Every day that Labor dithers means more hip-pocket pain for Australians. Our hardworking families who live in Capricornia deserve better than this government, and I will be fighting every day in this place to ensure we get our fair share.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms LAWRENCE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hasluck</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:37</span>):  This motion is the result of a fundamental misunderstanding compounded by the very much alive strain of climate denial that we continue to see bubble up to the surface in the leftover landfill site that now comprises the federal coalition. First of all, this is a fundamental understanding on the part of the coalition The loss-and-damage fund is not the result of a court process. It is not a legal obligation. But it's a prospective partnership of aid programs. I prefer to think of it as a misunderstanding, as I have often been well guided by Hanlon's razor: to never attribute to malice that which is adequately explained by stupidity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Nevertheless, the coalition terminated Australia's aid budget. Under the coalition, Australia has come 21st in a list of 29 OECD countries donating aid money to developing countries. We are wealthier than most of the countries ahead of us on that list. The new Labor government has pledged to rebuild Australia's development program and increase the official-development-assistance-to-gross-national-income ratios each year in an effort to counteract this downward trend.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Lowy Institute has found that foreign aid has historically not been popular with the Australian public—no doubt the basis for the coalition's dog-whistling. However, in 2022, Lowy found that cuts to the aid budget had become less popular. Forty-two per cent of Australians say spending on foreign aid should be kept around current levels, an increase of six percentage points since 2019; thirty-four per cent say foreign aid spending should be decreased, down by 13.4 percentage points; and 24 per cent say that Australia should increase spending on foreign aid, an increase of seven percentage points. The Lowy Institute also found that Australians are overwhelmingly in favour of Australia providing foreign aid to Pacific island states.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government is serious about being useful to our neighbours. But don't take my word for it. Let's check a review:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">"We warmly welcome this increase in the aid budget, which will make a world of difference to countless people in our region and beyond. We commend the focus on the Pacific and Southeast Asia as our closest neighbours, especially as these two regions have been devastated by the climate emergency, COVID-19 and now the cost-of-living crisis," said Kirsty Robertson, Caritas Australia's CEO.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other day the Prime Minister said that having a serious climate policy is now the price of entry into productive global relationships. I need to repeat that for the benefit of members opposite: having a serious climate policy is now the price of entry into productive global relationships. Members opposite are rather keen on free trade agreements but they have not yet joined the dots and understood that trade agreements are built on trust and shared interests. In September the head of the European parliament's trade committee, Bernd Lange, visited Australia. He was quoted as saying the Albanese government's enshrining of the emissions reduction target and legislation had removed a major barrier to the finalisation of the Australian-EU free trade agreement, and we expect to have that deal done soon. How ironic it is that if the former government had managed to have a workable climate change policy they may well have been able to close that deal on their watch.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing that has slowed down those negotiations was damage done to our relationship with France by the former Prime Minister, the member for Cook. Prime Minister Albanese has been busy repairing that relationship because our international relationships have to be about relationships. They cannot just be about trade, about seeing how much we can benefit financially from a series of transactions. If our neighbours are not prospering from the relationship then there is a real limit to how much we can prosper from it and a real limit to how much we morally should be able to. The opposition needs to realise that dog whistling is not a substitute for policy development. A climate change policy might be a good place to start. Climate denial is a problem for relationships and for aid, for trade and for good energy policy. When you reject the science you have to cling to something that is not science and there will always be loss and damage accompanying that.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wentworth</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:42</span>):  I rise in opposition to the motion moved by the member for Fairfax. Australia has an unedifying track record when it comes to international climate conferences. In the 1990s we opposed the Kyoto protocols. In the 2000s, having finally signed up to Kyoto, we withdrew. Last year we took an unambitious target to Glasgow and the then energy minister stated he wanted to use the conference to promote Australia as a safe and reliable destination for an investment in gas—in gas, a fossil fuel, at a climate conference.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Given this history it was great to see Australia back at the table at COP27. We saw several success stories from the conference. The Paris Agreement goal to hold temperature rises to 1.5 degrees was reaffirmed. Australia signed up to global compacts on limiting deforestation and accelerating climate finance. But, most importantly, the international community agreed to establish a loss-and-damage fund, which will go some way towards covering the cost facing countries most vulnerable to climate change, and these costs are enormous.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the last two decades, the 20 most at-risk countries have lost over half their economic growth potential due to climate change, equivalent to $525 billion. But these losses are not just about money; they are about people. They are felt by the 7.2 million people across Bangladesh who have had their communities washed away by flash flooding. They are felt by the 22 million people across Kenya, Somalia and Ethiopia who do not have enough food because of the worst drought in 40 years and they are felt by the five million people who die each year across the world because of extreme temperatures. And those countries most vulnerable to climate impacts include our friends and neighbours in the Pacific. Indeed, the risk to the Pacific of rising sea levels is so extreme that Tuvalu recently announced it would upload a digital replica of the entire country to the Metaverse in the hope of preserving their nation and culture after their lands are washed away—how heartbreaking. The idea that we should not support these countries is out of step with our commitment to being a good neighbour in the Pacific and is out of step with being a responsible global citizen.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The loss-and-damage fund is supported by the European Union and it is supported by the United States, and our Pacific neighbours have been calling for it for more than 30 years. We are at the early stages of developing the fund, but the COP27 text makes it clear that it will help focus on developing countries who are most vulnerable. It makes clear that the donor base will be expanded to include countries that have developed rapidly over the past 30 years, and that the funds will also come from multilateral institutions and global financial institutions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend the government for committing to participating in this fund and I reject the assertions made to really obscure the purpose of this fund, but I urge the government to go further. More ambition is needed if Australia is going to host COP31 in 2026 and, frankly, and more importantly, more ambition is needed if you're going to keep 1.5 degrees warming alive. That must start by ending public subsidies for fossil fuels.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My community in Wentworth was deeply disappointed to see Australia fail to sign a pledge to end public support for fossil fuels. The government must be resolute in its desire for this transition and a failure to sign a pledge that says, 'We won't spend money on fossil fuels,' flies in the face of what the government says it is committed to publicly. Fossil fuel subsidies are not good for our planet and they are not good use of taxpayers' money. The government must do better. And we must raise the bar on emissions reduction. The science is clear: 43 per cent is not enough, and so I urge the government to adopt, at minimum, a 50 per cent target by 2030—a position backed by business and the community. It's great that Australia is back on the international scene, but there is much more for us to do. Thank you.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Jagajaga</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:46</span>):  I suppose it's not a surprise that the opposition has decided to try and use the loss-and-damage fund agreed to at COP27 as a scare campaign, but it is a new low. It is clearly out of step with where the Australian people are, who clearly demonstrated in May this year that they wanted a government that is serious about climate change and its challenges—something this Labor government is and will continue to be.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian people have made it clear that they don't want a government like the previous Liberal-National one that put their head in the sand, actively denied and tried to pretend that climate change wasn't happening. And if May wasn't enough for them, let's look at Saturday in Victoria. Another clear message to those opposite that their dog whistling and their climate denial is out of step with where Australians are. I stood at booths across my electorate over the weekend—in Greensborough, in Eltham, in Ivanhoe—and nobody said to me, 'Gee, I don't think we should do anything on climate change.' Nobody said to me: 'We should slow down on climate change. It's not a critical issue.' Everyone I spoke to said to me climate change was one of the top issues in their minds, and one of the top issues they expected their governments to be dealing with. Once again, with this motion, what we see is an opposition that is out of step, that is out of touch, that is actively working against our country's and our communities' interests. It is just not good enough.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The loss-and-damage fund is in Australia's national interest. Its focus is simple: it will help developing countries to adapt and to respond to climate change. That is in our interest; it is in the interests of developing countries; it is in our entire planet's interests. It recognises what everyone knows, with the exception of those opposite it seems: that climate change is truly a global challenge. We do all need to be working together to maximise the efforts that we have to put in to combat climate change. As part of this we do have to recognise that while climate change impacts every country, the impacts are much larger in developing countries. A lot of this hits developing countries when we see changing weather patterns and natural disasters. While we are seeing natural disasters occur here in Australia more frequently, this is also happening across the world. Since the 1980s, natural disasters are up more than 80 per cent and almost half the population of our planet live in areas that are highly vulnerable to climate change.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many of those people live in developing nations. These are people whose lives are being turned over, almost consistently, by floods and by famine. This is a global problem. It is a problem that it is in Australia's interest to support efforts to fix and to mitigate, and that is what our government is doing with its support of this fund. We're not putting our heads in the sand. We're not pretending that this is something that Australia can go it alone on. We are saying that we are part of the world in finding this solution and we recognise that we have a responsibility to developing countries. We recognise that we are in a neighbourhood made up of many developing countries and we have a responsibility to support our neighbours, to act as a friend to our neighbours and to do what the previous government failed to do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The previous government tried to lecture our neighbours and wasn't there to support them. We are here to support their efforts and to support people's efforts to live in their countries while they're facing the increasing effect of climate change and climate induced disasters. After all, we know it was the Leader of the Opposition who, as a senior member of the previous government, said about the Pacific islands: 'Time doesn't mean anything when you're about to have water lapping at your door.' This is the sort of commentary that demonstrates the complete lack of interest in or understanding of the seriousness of the challenges being faced. People's lives and livelihoods were tossed away by the Leader of the Opposition with a toss-away comment that he thought wouldn't be heard.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, it was heard and it was noted, and what we see now—now that we have a Labor government that is prepared to genuinely engage in the Pacific—is that we are able to have strong relations with our neighbours. This is in their interests, but it is very much in our interests as Australians to have strong relations with our neighbours and with the rest of the world and to be in those international talks that we were locked out of because we were climate deniers. This government is getting on with it. The opposition is still stuck behind.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This year, 2022, is a very significant year for Australian military commemorations. In particular, this year marks the 80th anniversary of the Battle for Australia, which was a series of engagements during the Second World War around our mainland and the Indo-Pacific. It included the bombing of Darwin, the city that I'm so proud to represent, by 188 Japanese aircraft on 19 February 1942, which killed more than 250 people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This year we also cast our minds back 80 years to the sinking of HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Armidale</span> in action in World War II. On 1 December 1942, 100 Australians died during the sinking of HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Armidale</span>. This was the largest loss of life from any corvette in the Second World War. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Arm</span><span style="font-style:italic;">i</span><span style="font-style:italic;">dale</span> was operating out of Darwin. It left Darwin with orders to evacuate our troops and civilians from Timor in the face of the Japanese invasion. Operating in broad daylight, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Armidale</span> took a direct hit. Among the crew of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Armidale</span> was a young Tasmanian called Teddy Sheean, who was, of course, posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross a few years ago for heroically staying on the sinking <span style="font-style:italic;">Armidale</span> to fire on Japanese aircraft, stopping them from strafing his mates who were in the water.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm very proud of all the efforts of members of this parliament and the Tasmanian state government, and of the Sheean family and friends, who worked and campaigned so hard to get justice for Teddy. I was particularly proud that we all rose in the chamber and spoke up when former Prime Minister Morrison said no to Teddy Sheean getting that VC. We forced a situation where it was reviewed, and the decision was finally made for him to receive that award. I want to pay tribute to Teddy Sheean and those 49 men who were stranded at sea after the sinking and who suffered repeated attacks from the Japanese and also from sharks in the waters of the Timor Sea. It is an amazing story.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This year is also the 80th anniversary of Australian forces desperately fighting to push back the Japanese along the Kokoda Track in Buna, Gona and Sanananda, in Papua and in New Guinea, on the Huon Peninsula, at Wewak and on Bougainville. As well as World War II, this motion invites us to reflect on the 75th anniversary of Australian peacekeeping efforts this year. Australians were part of the first United Nations peacekeeping operation when military observers were deployed to the Dutch East Indies—now called Indonesia—in 1947. In every year since that time, Australian peacekeepers have served in locations throughout the world, ranging from the Middle East, Africa, South-East Asia and the Pacific,. Finally, this year is also the 50th anniversary of the year that Australia's fourth iteration of national service was abolished by the Whitlam Labor government on 5 December 1972.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">These were all exceptionally important events in our national life. It's only fitting that we thank all former and current personnel for their service in these and in other operations. ASPI fellow Graeme Dobell recently wrote that, over a span of 90 years, Australia went to war no fewer than nine times. He reflected that, over the 100 years since 1914, Australian personnel were on active service for 47 years or half of that time. That's incredible and it says a lot about Australia's involvement in world affairs relative to our population and about our standing up for what is right, standing up for freedom and standing up against oppressors. Our country has seen a significantly intense period of service in the last 20 years in particular, but, at this time, we remember World War II, we remember the peacekeepers, and we remember all those who served and their families.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr WILLCOX</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dawson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:57</span>):  I'm pleased to have the opportunity to acknowledge and recognise all those who have defended our great nation at home and overseas. It is because of their service, sacrifice and bravery that we experience freedom and peace in Australia today. Thank you to the member for Solomon, Mr Luke Gosling, for bringing this very important motion to the House. We should never take for granted our lucky country because it came at a cost. Today I join with my parliamentary colleagues to recognise those who served in the land, air and sea complex as part of the battle for Australia which successfully subdued the threat to our country during the Second World War.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have enjoyed sovereign piece for a long time in our nation. In 1942, Australian forces dug deep in Kokoda to stop the Japanese advance. The English had been defeated in Singapore and the Americans had lost the Philippines. The first to turn back the Japanese were the Australians in Papua New Guinea. And those Australians weren't only members of full-time divisions; they were people who were walking the streets of Sydney one day and the next day were fighting the Japanese on the Kokoda Trail. If Australia had lost and the Japanese had advanced onto our mainland, the Australia we know today would be entirely different. The rights and liberties we enjoy today would be horrifically different, so we remember the soldiers, airmen, sailors, nurses, doctors and others who served who, in many instances, were maimed or died for the protection of our great nation, Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">War comes at an immediate cost, but there's also a greater hidden cost that takes a significant toll in the years that follow. There are families that have been left without loved ones. This is a grief beyond measure. Today I pay my respects to the families who have lost loved ones and to those who have supported the loved ones who have served. The toll is great on our veterans. Many returned service men and woman come home with significant trauma—experiences that stay with them for a lifetime. It is crucial that we don't abandon our veterans at this time. People who have been good enough to put their body on the line—to put their life on the line—for this country deserve our complete support when they return home, and so do their families.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a nation, we must prioritise the wellbeing of our veterans and give priority to investment into their support services. The prevalence of PTSD and suicide among serving and ex-serving defence personnel is something of deep concern to both sides of this House. When in government, the coalition invested a record amount for our veterans. This is a legacy that I'm extremely proud of. We made it easier for veterans to make claims by establishing online digital access, and we funded additional staff to help deal with the backlog. The coalition government committed $5 million in my electorate of Dawson to fund a veterans wellness hub. This would have brought an RSL to Mackay, a wellness centre to the Mackay Memorial pool complex and a retreat to Kinchant Dam.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was disappointed that in Labor's first government budget, veterans wellness hubs north of Brisbane were canned. Centres like this are a fantastic initiative and will make a big difference in the lives of those who can access their services. Investing in supportive services for our veterans is too important to be on the chopping block. These cuts are devastating. However, I will work with the government to see that these services are fully supported and provide the much-needed services for our veterans, no matter what their postcode is. I would like to take this opportunity to thank Mr Ken Higgins, president of the Mackay RSL, for the support he provides to the veterans and for his strong advocacy on this project. I also thank Keith Payne VC—you could talk forever about Keith Payne—for his work on the Kinchant Dam retreat. Our community is stronger because of local champions like these guys.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The protection and sovereignty of our nation is paramount. We must take every effort to support our defence personnel, past and present. We are indebted to them forever. Thank you for your sacrifice. We will be there for you.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gilmore</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:02</span>):  I am really pleased the member for Solomon has put this motion forward today and I am delighted to support it. I will take any opportunity I can to thank our former and current Australian Defence Force personnel in my electorate and around Australia for their efforts defending our country and keeping us safe. The work you do is a source of national pride. We simply would not be able to live the lives we enjoy today if it weren't for you. That's why it is so important that we take the time to remember those who have made the ultimate sacrifice for us. Every loss of life in our Defence Force is a tragedy, and they all deserve to be remembered, respected and commemorated often.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also appreciate that the member for Solomon has acknowledged the families of those who serve. It is no easy thing to have someone you love in our Defence Force. It is no easy thing to be the one left behind. I have always had a special place in my heart for the families of those who serve. They are a big part of our community on the New South Wales South Coast, with two Navy bases in the Shoalhaven: HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Albatross</span> and HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Creswell</span>. I guess it shouldn't have been a surprise to me when I became one of them. My eldest son joined the Army a couple of years ago, and we are so incredibly proud of him. But, like many, he's based far away, so it has meant a huge separation, and we don't often get the opportunity to see him. I am inspired by all those local defence families who provide such a fantastic example, and I want to acknowledge their importance. Organisations like the Shoalhaven Defence Families Association, the Nowra Veteran Wellbeing Centre and our veterans organisations all provide an incredible local support service to help families through this journey. I so admire what you do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We recently commemorated Remembrance Day, 104 years after the guns fell silent on the Western Front, marking the end of the First World War. I was really proud to join with members of the Batemans Bay RSL sub-branch and the community at the Batemans Bay Soldiers Club to mark this important occasion. I always smile when I see how many people come along to mark these important occasions. Our community remembers, and we will always ensure our national heroes are never forgotten. It was a very moving service, with students from the local Carroll College reading out the names of the 26 people from the Eurobodalla who went to war and never came home—all young men, all taken too soon in defence of our country. We will always remember them. I'd like to sincerely thank president Brian Wheeler, secretary Les Arnould and all of the members of the sub-branch for their work putting this wonderful service together. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On Friday I also had the privilege of attending the annual corrective services Remembrance Day service at the South Coast Correctional Centre, importantly allowing our corrective services officers to pay tribute to lives sadly lost. Captain Robyn Phillips and Flight Commander Vanessa Stothart from HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Albatross </span>attended, along with members of the Nowra police, Fire New South Wales Nowra, and a number of other local representatives. It was my honour to join with them, and I would like to thank the South Coast Correctional Centre's governor and everyone involved in organising this service for having me along. With an electorate the size of Gilmore, it is impossible for me to attend all the wonderful local commemorative services, but I have an amazing team of volunteers who represented me at many services. Thank you to Councillor Liza Butler, Katelin McInerney, Maggie Lanham, Anthony Lawrence, Chris Cassidy, Cathy Russell, Roger Lucas, Tom Korevaar, Stephen Winslade, Jeremy Murdoch and Kareena Markham for paying my respects at Remembrance Day services up and down the South Coast.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our RSL sub-branches are, of course, nothing short of incredible. Run by volunteers, they provide an invaluable service to our local community. I want to sincerely thank every RSL sub-branch on the South Coast for the work you do every day. I also want to make special mention of the Gerringong RSL sub-branch, who, on 18 November, celebrated the 100th anniversary of the opening of the Soldiers Memorial Hall. I had a wonderful time at the book launch and high tea to celebrate this great event. Well done to president Mike O'Leary, secretary Jeff McClenaughan and everyone involved.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to reiterate my eternal thanks and gratitude to all our local veterans and Defence Force personnel and their families for selflessly putting the safety of our country above all else. We are eternally grateful. Lest we forget. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="176304" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr STEVENS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Sturt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:07</span>):  I start by thanking the member for Solomon for moving this motion. In fact, I had intended to move a similar motion, specific to the 80th anniversary of the culmination of Kokoda and the Battle of Buna-Gona. I very happily instead speak on this motion. The reason I make that point is that my great uncle served and was awarded the Military Cross at Gona Beach in December 1942. He was Major Hugh Dalby. My grandfather, Frank Stevens, also served in the Pacific theatre, in the Royal Engineers. Prior to that, he served in North Africa. We're very lucky in our family that he got on the boat that went to Egypt and not the one that went to Singapore, because I don't think I would be standing here today if he had. My mother's mother was a nurse during the war and served at the Heidelberg hospital in Melbourne. She nursed and cared for many, many returned POWs and other Australian service personnel who had horrendous wounds, sometimes torturous, and other awful experiences, psychologically, that they endured through that whole period of time. It's very appropriate that we as a parliament always take an opportunity to remember the unbelievable service that has been done for our nation by so many brave Australians. That service has put us in a position to live in the free society that we live in right now and to have a vibrant democracy where we can come together and talk about the issues and challenges of the day. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I always find that, when people from overseas come to Australia, one thing that strikes them in every town in this country—unless they're English—is that, when they drive through the towns of this nation, there is not a single one that doesn't have a war memorial at some prominent location. Most of them, first and foremost, were built after the Great War, and they have then been supplemented, tragically, of course, by the need to also memorialise those who served and those who were killed in the Second World War. The way in which service to our nation through those wars was so ubiquitous across this country is spectacular. Not a single community was untouched by both service in those wars and death in those wars. It goes to show the mentality and the bravery of the young men of this nation who, from every single corner, took the opportunity to join and serve, to fight for liberty and freedom and to give us the society that we have today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I very much join in commemorating the service and the 80th anniversary of those who served in New Guinea, including the two members of my family whom I've mentioned and the tens of thousands who served there, and the many who died there—both there and subsequently, because, regrettably, the statistics don't properly reflect the casualties and the fatalities from service in Papua New Guinea. A lot of people were repatriated to Australia but succumbed to their wounds and to other challenges that came from the brutality and the torment of serving in those conditions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also thank the people of Papua New Guinea—the 'fuzzy wuzzy angels' and others who provided such unbelievable service in support of Australian and allied troops in very challenging terrain. That, of course, gave our soldiers such an edge over Japanese forces. I think it was Paul Keating who was a little bit dismissive of Gallipoli—I don't support his view—but he very much held the view that Kokoda was the true birth of the fighting spirit and heritage of the Australian Army because it was very much us defending against the risk of invasion of our nation and us having to be at the vanguard of turning the tide of the Japanese advance through the Asia-Pacific. We remember the service of all those Australians and many other friends from many other nations which ensured that we stopped that tide and that we live in the free democratic society that we take for granted today.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="300129" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BURNELL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Spence</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:12</span>):  I rise to support the motion moved by the member for Solomon. On indulgence—I would like to acknowledge the member for Solomon, as well as all members from all sides of this place, for his service to our country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will always speak in support of our current serving Australian Defence Force members, those who have served and those who have made the ultimate sacrifice in the defence of Australia and our way of life for maintaining world order and peace for a time. The motion moved in the name of the member for Solomon allows me to do exactly that. This year, 2022, has been a milestone year in the history of our armed forces. Those major milestones are listed in the motion itself. It marks the 80th anniversaries of the Battle for Australia, the tragic sinking of HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Arm</span><span style="font-style:italic;">i</span><span style="font-style:italic;">dale</span> and the pushing back of the Japanese along the famous Kokoda Track. HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Arm</span><span style="font-style:italic;">i</span><span style="font-style:italic;">dale</span> is a particularly painful national memory. The sinking of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Arm</span><span style="font-style:italic;">i</span><span style="font-style:italic;">dale</span> will have occurred 80 years ago in three days time. It was a horrific loss of life, with over 100 lives lost at sea. Thankfully, 49 survivors were rescued.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Some of these conflicts really are the stuff of legend. They are exactly that for those, like ourselves, looking back at these conflicts historically or academically. But for the young men out there on the field some 80 years ago, there was no legend; it was just about survival—survival for themselves, their brothers-in-arms and the nation of Australia. Many of us have been touched by these battles. Many of us had family serving in them. It is something that we always like to learn more about, whether that be through quiet chats with relatives, through the National Archives or through the Australian War Memorial, just to list a few ways to learn a little about your family's military history.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When you find out a little bit, you can't help but want to discover even more. Sometimes my inquisitive nature does get the better of me. The Second World War touched many families across this great country and my family was no different. I would like to pay tribute to my family's service: in particular, my grandfather on my mother's side, Federal Stokie Rodda, serving as a gunner in the 2nd Field Regiment in New Guinea and Bougainville; on my father's side, my grandfather, Malcolm Rex Burnell, as a captain with the Australian Army, serving his time in Darwin as part of our homeland defence; and his brother, Noel George Burnell, a flying officer who paid the ultimate sacrifice, killed in action in New Guinea as part of No. 23 Squadron. His memory is immortalised in the Lae Memorial in Papua New Guinea to this day. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This year, 2022, also marks the 75th anniversary of the Australian peacekeeping efforts, something that proudly continued in the years that followed. Australia's peacekeeping efforts were not solely confined to include members of the Australian Defence Force but included police officers who were seconded to these operations, some of whom made the ultimate sacrifice. Australia has always done its duty as good international citizens in times of peace, times of war and in times of civil unrest and upheaval abroad, whether this be close to our doorstep or further afield. Australia has fielded personnel to serve amongst the United Nations peacekeeping operations as military observers in Indonesia, back in 1947, and were the first into the field. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Further, 2022 marks the year I was first elected as a member of this place. In my time since, I have done my utmost to connect with my veteran community within Spence and more broadly across my state of South Australia, whether it be through my engagement with several dedicated, diverse and caring organisations which, like me, want to see our veterans looked after and honoured; my engagement with the Salisbury, Elizabeth and Gawler RSLs; or by simply reading through and issuing a certificate of appreciation through the Saluting Their Service program. When an application for a certificate is provided to my office, I can't help but look through the contents of the application, which is often supplied together with the service record and their history. This is a fantastic initiative that has been a bipartisan one. I'd invite any eligible veterans from my electorate of Spence to make an application to my office for such a certificate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To the veteran community, I thank you for your service, and I would like to leave you in no doubt that the parliament and your country does so too. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="219646" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr McCORMACK</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Riverina</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:17</span>):  At the outset, I acknowledge the member for Solomon, his service, his recognition of this important motion and the service of all other parliamentarians who have worn a uniform and who have served their country. Indeed, I acknowledge all those who have worn a uniform and served their country in the past, those who do so right at this very minute, and those who will do so in the future. I also note the member Solomon's motion, which includes the 80th anniversary of the battle for Australia, the 80th anniversary of the sinking of HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Armidale</span>, the 80th  anniversary of pushing back the Japanese on the Kokoda Track, the 75th anniversary of the Australian peacekeeping efforts, and half a century since the end of national service. I acknowledge the fact that Wagga Wagga and the wonderful cenotaph in the Victory Memorial Gardens doesn't have too many days when there are not floral tributes on that World War I monument, and that is because in Wagga Wagga we commemorate and we celebrate so much and so many of the good deeds done by our veterans for these important milestone events. In the gardens, there is a derrick from HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Sydney</span> and a mark can be seen on the flagpole where it was struck by a shell during the encounter off Cocos Islands in 1914 which resulted in the sinking of the German cruiser <span style="font-style:italic;">Emden</span>. Wagga Wagga's involvement with battles past goes back to Sudan and even before that. Indeed, many men served in the second Boer War of 1899 to 1902. Of course, we had a long line of khaki join the Australian Imperial Force at Gallipoli and other confrontations of the Great War, the First World War of 1914 to 1918—no war is great.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are very proud of our military heritage. We are very proud of our history as a city. Indeed, there is no other inland regional centre which has bases of all three arms of Defence: RAAF, Navy and Army. If you spend any given time in the Air Force, you end up at Forest Hill. All of the basic recruit training for the Australian Army is done at Kapooka. And we have thousands of veterans who reside in the Riverina electorate. Many of them come to the commemorations at the Victory Memorial Gardens to honour those who went before us. That is why I will continue to fight for a wellness centre for Wagga Wagga, for those veterans.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ironically and coincidentally, the Royal Commission into Defence and Veteran Suicide will conduct its eighth hearing in Wagga Wagga from today. That will continue until Thursday. I urge and encourage any veteran with a story to tell to take part in those important hearings. The royal commission will accept submissions up until 13 October next year. We need to protect our veterans every step of the way. That's why this royal commission is so important—to hear those stories and, more importantly, to act upon what we do here, to make sure that our men and our women are very much front of mind when it comes to legislation, front of mind when it comes to care. I know the Department of Veterans' Affairs does a very good job in doing that, but there are those who have fallen through the cracks and there are those for whom we need to provide every bit of support that we can as a nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have many milestones to honour in this nation. I told the parliament only the other day that there were more bombs dropped on northern Australia than were dropped on Pearl Harbor. That's a thing that I don't think too many schoolchildren know, but it's a thing that we should teach. The very first New Zealander reported killed at Gallipoli in 1915 enlisted in my electorate. He enlisted at Junee. Wilfred Knight was his name, and he fought for the AIF, but he was a proud Kiwi. I want to make sure that his service, his sacrifice, is honoured with a life-sized bronze statue in Broadway, to have that intrinsic important link that is very much at the heart of Anzac. If ever there was an Anzac story that talked about the spirit of the legend of khaki and the legend of Anzac, it is Wilfred Knight's story—a New Zealander who served for Australia and enlisted in country New South Wales. It's an amazing and remarkable story.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Like the member for Spence, many of us in this place have a family connection. Maurice Joseph Curran is mine. He died in World War I. I honour him just like I honour every single man and woman who has donned the uniform, who has gone out and served our nation.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kooyong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:00</span>):  For over 40 years the Islamic Republic regime has committed terrorist acts and human rights atrocities against the people of Iran, including shocking instances of gender based violence. The killing of 22-year-old Mahsa Amini in September this year, after being arrested for not wearing the hijab in accordance with government standards, has led to an unprecedented nationwide uprising led largely by women whose dignity and rights have been crushed by this brutal regime. Responding with a brutal crackdown, Islamic Republic authorities have killed hundreds of peaceful demonstrators and injured many more.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate and my office I have met with many Kooyong constituents of Iranian background who profoundly appreciate their freedom in Australia but fear for their family and friends in Iran. They have called on the Australian government to actively support in every way possible the brave men and women of Iran in their struggle, including the practical actions included in the petition of more than 50,000 signatures presented in the House this morning. These actions will align Australia with other liberal democratic states and enable us to uphold our democratic and human rights values. I support the spirit and the content of this petition and call on the Australian government to implement targeted sanctions and ensure that we are not supporting this brutal regime.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bennelong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:01</span>):  I rise for the third time to speak to the deep concern and dismay that many constituents in Bennelong continue to discuss with me about the heavy-handed measures against Iranians by Iranian authorities. It has been 73 days since the death in custody of Mahsa Amini and Iranian people, both in Iran and around the world, continue to rise together in protest. The Iranian government has met these protests with brutal violence and heavy handedness.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister, the foreign affairs minister and this government have vehemently expressed their resounding condemnation of Iran's treatment of protestors and the serious concerns held regarding Iran's human rights record. In November, Australia joined Canada and New Zealand in expressing their grave concerns about the situation in Iran to the United Nations Security Council, including leading the call for the removal of Iran from the Commission on the Status of Women.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today the chair of the petitions committee presented to this place the petitions report, which included 13 separate petitions to parliament regarding Iran, with combined signatures from more than 70,000 people. I have a responsibility to the Iranian and Kurdish communities in Bennelong to continue to stand in solidarity and be their voice to the government on this matter. It's a responsibility I take seriously. I stand today with them in their right to peace. I stand with them in advocating for the rights of women, girls, children, those of all religious faiths and the LGBTIQ+ communities to live safely and freely in Iran and around the world. Zan, zendegi, azadi.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Brisbane</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:03</span>):  Young people are increasingly disenfranchised with the Australian political system. They see government as an institution which actually hampers progress on issues that are of crucial importance to them, namely education, mental health care, climate change and housing. The national School Strike 4 Climate strikes are a powerful example of this. Thousands of young people are taking to the street to demand that their futures are protected by robust action on climate change because they have no other choice but to work outside of the political system.</span>

They will inherit the planet, economy and living conditions that we decide for them. Australia has previously led the way in the expansion of democracy, being one of the first countries to give women the right to vote, start the secret ballot and give women the right to run for office before any other jurisdiction. It is time for us to lead the way again; it is time to lower the voting age.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moreton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:04</span>):  Today the National Party consigned themselves to the past and to infamy. It was right up there with my first day in parliament, when the member for Dickson walked out on the apology to the stolen generations. Today, the Nationals stood as one and said no to a voice to parliament for First Nations people. The Leader of the Nationals has the hide to stand up and say that they believe in empowering local Indigenous communities, when they did nothing for the 10 years they were in government. This is a party whose former leader proclaimed after the Wik decision that they would make laws to extinguish native title as much as they could. When they were in government they forced people in remote communities onto the cashless debit card. How is this empowering them?</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I spent the weekend out at St George, my home town, for my 40th high school reunion, and I can tell you that local people in the bush are ready to hear the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Voice delivered. First Nations people and white people out in the bush are ready for the Voice to Parliament. The Nationals are an anachronism. They have no relevance to the bush anymore. There are no farmers left in the National and there's no connection with the bush anymore.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Nationals should be ashamed of themselves. I thought that the leader, the member from south-west Queensland, would be more in tune with the people, but he is so disconnected from the bush that he should be ashamed of himself. The leader of the LNP in Queensland should be ashamed as well.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Monash</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:09</span>):  I wonder how many Australians know that G20 leaders recently declared their commitment to a global digital health network and, more importantly, what this might mean for all of us. The G20 have signed a joint declaration which promotes a global standard on proof of vaccination for international travel. It calls for global digital health networks that build on existing digital COVID vaccine passport technology. In short, the G20 has agreed to a global COVID vaccine passport. Prime Minister Anthony Albanese signed off on a declaration of intent in Bali this month. The next step is for a treaty to be signed. If that proceeds then Australians will have unknowingly signed off their rights to an unelected foreign body. This means that an organisation like the World Health Organization will be able to dictate to Australians what to do with their bodies if they wish to travel overseas. Scarily, it's legal. It's not illegal; it's legal. These decisions are already in place in other countries such as the US, where you cannot enter the country as an international traveller unless you are fully vaccinated or have a medical exemption. Australians must stand up and say no to their elected representatives and government before it's too late. I spoke in the parliament only a few minutes ago on the possibility of erosion of freedoms as we walk into good legislation and new technologies in these cases. This is another example of the government trying to do good but eroding our freedoms once again.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The latest census shows that there are about 409,000 people across Australia with Filipino ancestry, 21,000 of whom live in in South Australia. With over 300,000 of them having been born in the Philippines, they are now the fifth-largest overseas-born sector in Australia, with most Filipino people in Australia having come in the last 50 years. They have done a lot for the development of our country and the prosperity we enjoy here in Australia. Filipino people contribute to Australia through the arts, entertainment, sports, business, the skilled trades and, in particular, working in the personal care services.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Flynn</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:12</span>):  Before the election, both the Prime Minister and the Treasurer promised Australian retirees and investors that there would be no change to franking credits. An inquiry in April 2019 showed that abolishing refundable franking credits would unfairly hit people of modest incomes who have already retired and who are unlikely to be able to return to the workforce to make up the income that they will lose. It would force many people who have saved throughout their lives to be independent in retirement onto the age pension. This would undermine any objective of raising revenue and reducing dependence on taxpayers resulting from an ageing population.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite ruling out the policy back in March 2022, Labor has broken a key election promise and hit retirees and investors with a new $555 million tax, depriving investors of franking credits that they had previously relied on, especially for retirement security. This is the second change to franking credits since the election and a clear breach of trust with the Australian people. I do not support these changes, and Australians do not deserve to be taxed twice.</span>

They may have overcome personal difficulties or hardship, or they've supported others in their school and the community to be resilient throughout the year. These students sometimes may fly under the radar but, through this award, I and our community can recognise them for showing others the way forward and for being a role model.</span>

It's been wonderful to hear all of your stories, both of what you've achieved this year and of your hopes for the future. You've all shown amazing strength, and I hope this award recognises that and celebrate your efforts.</span>

Improved health services were a crucial part of my campaign at the recent election. Among our commitments, I made a promise to deliver an MRI licence for the new Maitland Hospital, locally known as the Metford hospital too.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Federal Labor committed to delivering this vital infrastructure for our community, and delivered it in the recent budget. I was delighted that, following the May election, the Hon. Mark Butler, Minister for Health and Aged Care, worked with me to deliver this vital commitment for our region. The deed of undertaking, otherwise known as the MRI licence for Maitland Hospital, was executed on 4 November this year. From this date, I'm delighted to say, MRI services will be eligible for Medicare rebate, provided the MRI service is listed on the MBS and is requested by a specialist doctor or GP. I'm delighted to be part of a Labor government that offers incentives to encourage diagnostic imaging providers to bulk-bill their patients, by paying an additional 10 per cent of the MBS fee. We are delivering for Paterson, as only a Labor government can.</span>

The station provides lots of important services, making announcements for organisations like Head to Health, East Hills Men's Shed, Bankstown Canterbury Community Transport and many others. For many people in our community, it is an absolutely essential part of the media landscape. I want to thank Julie-Anne Munns, the station manager; Tony Bennetts; Marilyn Brewer; George Sinnis; Sasho Trpcevki; and all of the directors and volunteers at Connect FM, who do such a fantastic job for our community.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Scouts has stood the test of time. Things don't hang around for more than a century unless there's something very special about them. That's very much reflected at 2nd Mortdale scouts, where, on Saturday, I was able to join in the celebrations of its 70th anniversary. Mortdale has a very strong scouting group. Susan Ray, the group leader, and all the other leaders—there are many leaders at 2nd Mortdale—do a tremendous job. It was good to see Brian Davidson, the regional commissioner for south metropolitan scouts, and the many kids and families who were there to celebrate the special values and skills the kids learn and the great experiences the kids have at 2nd Mortdale scouts.</span>

I don't think she ever stopped thinking about how to improve the lives of others.</span>

In my electorate on the Mid North Coast, we have some of the most damning statistics in the country when it comes to family and domestic violence.

Marilyn sent his story to me because she wants his story on the parliamentary record as an example. We must treat our old people and those in aged care better.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The aged-care system, so long neglected, was broken under the previous government. COVID showed us how vulnerable our aged-care system is, and this Labor government will do everything it can to fix it. If a doctor or registered nurse had been on site the day Klaas felt ill, he might still be with us today. This is what makes the reforms to aged care so important. We're talking about lives; we're talking about families; we're talking about the old people who built this nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Marilyn, nothing I'm going to say here is going to bring your husband back, but the Albanese government hears your story and will make sure that his story is not forgotten and the aged-care system gets the attention that it deserves.</span>

My electorate is half of New South Wales and a third of the Murray-Darling Basin, and every single square inch of it at some stage or other has been flooded. At the moment, the focus is on the Lachlan River as the flood peak moves down beyond Condobolin to Euabalong, Lake Cargelligo and the small community of Murrin Bridge. That's about the third flood that's been down there. It's different this time. In previous floods, there's generally a rainfall event, we have a flood, and it moves on, but this has been going on for months and months and months.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was with the Premier of New South Wales and the local state member in Condobolin on Friday. The SES, who are largely volunteers, have been away from their homes and away from their jobs for weeks now, and that strain is starting to show. But there was relief that had come from Indigenous firefighters from the city and fly-in squads that had come through. The focus now is on the Darling. Bourke is completely surrounded, and Brewarrina has been isolated for some months. It's all heading down through Wilcannia and Menindee into the lower Darling. I would think that South Australia will need to be bracing after Christmas for what will have to be a record flood.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Reid</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:26</span>):  On 20 October, the 2nd Abbotsford Sea Scouts group celebrated their 90th consecutive year of operation, making them one of the oldest Sea Scouts groups in the country. This group has long connections to my electorate of Reid and has deep ties to many families in the community. They operated through the Second World War, with many older scouts and leaders leaving the group to enlist in the armed services. Through the post-war baby boom, the group flourished, with a vibrant program for kids of working families across the community. Today, they continue to run a suite of superb activities such as sailing, waterskiing, hiking and camping. All these sports allow participants to develop their physical and social skills in a fun team setting.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I want to thank and congratulate the group for their contribution to the community. They are teaching kids to love and appreciate the great outdoors and, importantly, they are teaching them to work as a team, supporting and looking out for each other. Scouts play a crucial role in building leadership in our kids, and I want to congratulate the 2nd Abbotsford Sea Scouts group on their 90 years of operation. I thank the volunteer scout leaders, in particular group leader Con Zacharias, for all their hard work and commitment to the local community.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Forrest</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:27</span>):  Harvey local Brady Hough, a talented South West athlete, was drafted to the West Coast Eagles last year. He played for Harvey Brunswick Leschenault in the South West Football League, playing one senior game for the club in 2020, and ended the season by winning the club's 'best first-year player' and 'player of the finals' awards. He then took his footy to the next level, playing with WAFL team Peel Thunder in 2021. His natural abilities caught the attention of talent scouts very early. Even though he'd only played 11 cults games and one senior match for Peel, he was selected by the West Coast Eagles in 2021 draft.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After a strong preseason, Brady made his AFL debut on 20 March during the round 1 match against the Gold Coast in Perth. He amassed 10 disposals, three tackles, two marks and a clearance. In a West Coast season devastated by injury, Brady was a standout, playing 15 matches and ultimately winning the club's 'emerging talent' award, an honour that's been won by some of the club's biggest names. Earlier this month, Brady was also announced as the 2021 AJ (Tood) Buswell <span style="font-style:italic;">South Western Times</span> Sports Star of the Year, an award that was delayed due to COVID. Congratulations, Brady, on an outstanding year. I wish you all the best for the upcoming season and future ahead. And I know that his parents are very, very proud of him.</span>

Pauline has lived an extraordinary life. Born in Lebanon, she moved to Australia with her family when she was just 11 years old. Her family settled in Melbourne. Pauline and her late husband Eddie moved to Cooma in 1947, where they bought a local general store. The store sold everything, from groceries to clothes and kept the fishing tackle plentiful, much of it through the boom with the commencement of the Snowy Hydro project. It was mentioned to me that despite being in her late 80s, Pauline still worked nine to five. After 61 years, Pauline had become Cooma's longest-serving businesswoman, closing the store in 2008. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Among Pauline's fondest memories is when she carried the Queen's Baton through Cooma as part of the celebrations for the 2006 Commonwealth Games, when she was 84. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I took valuable notes on her key to longevity: keeping active by 'just doing something every day', continuing to enjoy a Middle Eastern diet, whilst also making a point of dressing nicely every day. Thank you to the aged-care staff at Warrigal in Stirling for their care and kindness for Pauline. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

You'll get my Christmas card in the mail soon, so look out for that. It's being delivered to the people of Petrie in the next week or so. It reads as follows: 'It's the most wonderful time of the year. During this Christmas and holiday season, let's take time to reflect on the many blessings we have been given, including our relationships with others. As the shadow minister for defence personnel, I'd like to take this opportunity to thank all the members of the Australian Defence Force for their service and I wish them a very merry Christmas and holiday season. I pray for peace, health and prosperity over you and your loved ones, and I look forward to continuing to serve you as your federal MP throughout 2023.' </span>

The Premier of Queensland was there, The Speaker and local MP, Milton Dick, and the federal Minister for Sport, Anika Wells, were also there. We were all proudly cheering on the Brisbane Lions before a sell-out crowd. This state-of-the-art stadium is jointly funded by the federal and Queensland government's, the Ipswich City Council, the AFL and the Brisbane Lions and private partners, including Springfield City Group. It shows what can be done when we all work together.</span>

I want to particularly congratulate Greg Swann, the CEO of the Brisbane Lions, and I give a big shout-out to the former chair, Bob Sharpless. This would not have happened without you, Bob. You made a great effort. Your tireless work has brought this about. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The stadium is the culmination of years of work and is the new home for the AFL team, the Brisbane Lions. It will be the training ground for the men's and women's team and the home ground facility for the women's team. It will also house Multicultural Australia, for the growing multicultural communities in the eastern suburbs and across Ipswich. It's a world-class arena and is earmarked as a potential 2032 Olympics and major concert site. </span>

The speech is in response to the following question posted by Raise Our Voice Australia: What should Australia's new parliament accomplish? Here are Dominic's words:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">$80 million for a supposed water buyback. More than $100 million in sports rorts. Countless subsidies and grants to corporations. All out of the taxpayer pocket. This is what Australian politics has become.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Systemic corruption has always been an issue in Australia, and the cracks are clearly visible. Our ranking in the Transparency International Corruption Perceptions Index dropped 6 places between 2012 and 2015. In 2019, only 25 % of Australians said they trusted the government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The duty of parliament is to serve the Australian people, not lobbyists nor donors. Corruption and pandering to corporate interests is never acceptable, regardless of party affiliation. The proposed National Anti-Corruption Commission is a promising start to combating the rampant integrity issues in our government. I encourage parliament to strengthen the commission by ensuring public hearings and implementing additional measures such as a whistleblower protection authority.</span>

The Albanese government's first budget has failed to deliver the necessary funding that our community requires to address unmet needs. Patient waiting times at our local Joondalup Hospital have continued to escalate, with ambulances containing patients ramped outside the emergency department for 677 hours during October. Ambulance ramping peaked in May this year, with over 1,022 hours of ramping at our hospital. In 2022, ambulances have spent over 54,000 hours ramped outside WA hospitals, 1,600 more hours than in 2021 and over 28,000 more hours than in 2020. Yet no provision has been made in the current budget for future health facilities to meet anticipated population growth. This is short-sighted when we know that the population in the region is growing at the rate of 10,000 residents per year, will only mean greater pressure on the already overstretched Joondalup Hospital with longer waiting times for patients.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hunter</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:38</span>):  Representing your country on the world stage is the highest honour you can achieve in your sporting career. Aaron Batchelor is a passionate pool plyer from Muswellbrook. He is a board member of the Australian Blackball International Federation and is also the head coordinator of the learning and physical disability section. Aaron's story is truly inspiring. Unfortunately, Aaron had a stroke when he was nine years old and was told by doctors that he would never play sport again. But after being invited to go and play some pool with his best mate, Tim, he discovered a new passion. Aaron discovered that despite having no movement in his fingers and minimal movement in his elbow and shoulder, he could rest a pool cue on his arm and use his right arm to shoot the ball.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Earlier this year Aaron was selected to represent Australia at the Blackball World Championships in Morocco in October. He was also chosen to be the flag bearer for the Australian team. What a great honour that would be. Aaron finished fourth in the singles event and the disabled team finished third in the world. Congratulations, Aaron, and your team, on a successful world championships, and I look forward to having a game of pool with you at a pub shortly.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HAMILTON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Groom</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:39</span>):  Over the weekend, we saw an extraordinary development in Labor's reckless quest to pass its radical workplace relations agenda. On Saturday night, Labor leaders engaged in a late-night talkfest with Independent Senator David Pocock to strike a deal on the passage of the bill. According to media reports, up for negotiation was a change to the size of businesses that could be roped into multi-employer bargaining, with the threshold lifted from 15 to 20 employees. Businesses with fewer than 50 employees can also, supposedly, now avoid industry-wide bargaining if there is a belief that they are not comparable with other companies, with the onus on the union movement to prove a common interest.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unsurprisingly these concessions have not eased the fears of the family owned and aspirational businesses in my electorate. They, along with many business groups, agree with the coalition's assessment that Labor's legislation will complicate the system, create conflict in workplaces and cause delays. On top of this, the Independent senator's deal does not remove the issue of costs revealed in the regulatory impact statement. An owner of a small or medium-sized business in my region is still on the hook for between $14,000 and $80,000 in costs if forced to participate in multi-employer bargaining. Given how tough times are, I don't know many who could afford such a hefty hit, especially with power prices, inflation and interest rates all going up.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor has tried to reduce this debate to be simply about wages, neglecting to mention that jobs could be lost if businesses are forced to scale back or close. Key Australian values of autonomy and freedom of association will be undermined as businesses lose their ability to negotiate in the shift of power towards the unions.</span>

The result was a ringing endorsement not only of the Andrews Labor government's last eight years of governing but also of their vision for the next four. The Andrews Labor government presented a comprehensive plan for doing what matters. Like the majority of people in my electorate of Hawke, I am very, very proud to have gone out and voted for it. We voted for new TAFE campuses in Sunbury and Melton. We voted to upgrade schools and facilities in Bacchus Marsh. And, as my friend the member for Hunter will be very pleased to hear, we voted for a real Melton hospital. We voted for free kinder and for cleaner and cheaper energy through the re-establishment of the SEC. We voted for more level crossing removals and better conditions for Victorian workers.</span>

I congratulate Premier Dan Andrews and his chief of staff, my friend Lissie Ratcliff. I also congratulate the team at Victorian Labor for running an exceptional campaign, particularly state secretary, Chis Ford, Jett Fogarty and Darren Moss.</span>

Together with Hills Domestic Violence Prevention Network, the Lisa Harnum Foundation, the Sanctuary Hills Women's Shelter, they also acknowledged by name in a rose ceremony each and every person who has died from domestic violence this year. This is a powerful way to recognise that the women and the people who die from domestic violence each year are not just statistics but are individuals. All of those names were spoken, and the lives and the individuality of those people were acknowledged in a ceremony at the Castle Hill RSL.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an important motion, because it appears that the current government has forgotten the amazing support that the coalition delivered when we were last in government to support the creative economy during the COVID pandemic. As you know, the creative economy needs venues, needs people and needs crowds, and it was not forgotten during the COVID lockdown period.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Restart Investment to Sustain and Expand, RISE, fund was a considerable fund—$200 million in total. There were seven rounds of funding to a wide variety of creative projects across the country. Some examples that I've looked up include the Sound Station Music &amp; Arts Festival in Newcastle; the development and tour of a new physical theatre production, <span style="font-style:italic;">Air Time</span>; and various tours, like the Empire Touring theatre series, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Hi</span><span style="font-style:italic;">de</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">the </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Dog</span> tour, and the production, regional tour and mentorship program done by Riverside's National Theatre of Parramatta. Across the country, these are some of the things that we funded to keep people enjoying the arts and to make all these creative industries, which employ hundreds of thousands of people, viable during the COVID lockdowns and periods when crowds were not possible.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also announced the Arts Sustainability Fund, which systemically supported many large arts companies to survive, because, while they do get government funding, they rely on income from exhibitions and from visitors to their performances. Some of these peak entities were nationally renowned and internationally known. We were faced with the prospect that all the skills that had been collected would have fizzled away and vanished. That's people like the Sydney Symphony Orchestra, the Sydney Theatre Company, the Brandenburg ensemble, the Queensland Ballet, Opera Australia, Design Tasmania and the National Institute of Dramatic Art, NIDA, where my brother spent time as a young teenager—it's internationally renowned; all the Australian actors and actresses who have reached international heights seem to have gone through NIDA or similar dramatic arts institutes. It's people like the Melbourne Theatre Company, the internationally renowned Australian Ballet—imagine if that had folded because they couldn't perform and earn income and keep the troupes together—Circa Contemporary Circus Ltd and the Malthouse Theatre. In total, all the other things amounted to $1 billion, which is an amazing portfolio assembled for the Commonwealth government to support the creative arts and art funding.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the budget in March 2022, an extra $20 million was allocated to the RISE Fund. It was deployed in the March 2022 budget, but it appears to have gone missing in action. There was a faux reannouncement as though it was new money. The same $20 million appeared in an announcement by the current government for a Live Performance Support Fund, but nothing has ever come out of it. Talk about moving the chestnuts around the table and trying to confuse people!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The motion refers to the 'abrupt and discourteous disbanding of the Creative Economy Taskforce which comprised a distinguished group' of eminent arts leaders who'd been doing outstanding work. To summarily disband it is counterproductive. I know every government wants to make its mark, but, when there are good things that have been established and are delivering long-term benefit, a wise government looks at what's there and makes a dispassionate decision. I can't imagine they would assemble a better group of people. The RISE Fund was critical. As the motion says, it was 'supporting 541 projects in over 4,000 locations, creating over 195,000 job opportunities and experiences reaching more than 55 million Australians'. That's an amazing achievement in the space of three years.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canberra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:51</span>):  I thank the member for creating this opportunity to talk about the arts, as I am always really proud to talk in this place about the arts and particularly the vibrant and active arts community in the ACT, who I've been proud to advocate for throughout the pandemic. The arts were so critical. The arts are so central to all aspects of Australian life. They tell our stories. They inspire us, and the pandemic really brought this to the fore, as it was to the arts that we looked for comfort and entertainment. But it was also the arts that suffered the most, as people were unable to gather together at live performances or in galleries, and the jobs in those sectors were obviously some of the first to be hit and were the worst hit by the economic impacts of the pandemic.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, throughout that time, I and others in the then opposition were very proud to stand up and fight for the arts in this place, as they were neglected by the previous government throughout that. For the first hundred days of the pandemic, nothing was said by the previous coalition government about the arts. Arts workers were largely left out of the JobKeeper scheme due to the nature of their employment, and there was no specific support for them for a very long time. It was as if people in the arts were not seen as real workers—as if the jobs of creatives and people in creative industries were not equal to other jobs. We also saw that in the university sector and with casuals, and I could go on. But I will focus today on the arts sector. The then Liberal-National government really were dragged kicking and screaming to support the arts sector during the pandemic at all, while artists desperately needed our help.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to note that it's the arts community who are often the first to step up and support the broader community when disaster hits. The bushfires were a perfect example of that. The arts community made donations and ran performances to raise money for affected communities. But, when they were hit, their government was missing in action.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The then minister Paul Fletcher misled people about how much support was going to the arts sector during the COVID pandemic. He claimed that up to $10 billion in support was going to arts sector workers through the JobKeeper scheme, but included in that were workers in non-arts sectors like clothing and footwear wholesaling and retailing, clothing manufacturing, jewellery wholesaling and retailing sectors—so not really arts at all.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The belated response, establishing the RISE Fund, had no vision and no strategy. The Liberals and Nationals came under fire, as we know, for granting $1.35 million to a Guns N' Roses tour while our Australian performers and artists were really struggling and the neediest parts of the sector were left with nothing. This was heavily criticised by Australian artists and by Labor.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia has had two landmark cultural policies and those were both delivered by Labor: Creative Nation, under Paul Keating, and Creative Australia, under Simon Crean. We will honour that legacy by delivering a national cultural policy. The Liberals, in fact, scrapped the last national cultural policy in 2013 and they replaced it with nothing. So we are very proud, now in government again, to have this well underway in our first six months. It will be announced by the end of the year. Minister Tony Burke has been travelling the country talking with artists, creatives and the sector around the development of that policy, and I was really pleased to attend his town hall in Canberra with our arts community—notably at the Gorman Arts Centre, to which federal Labor will contribute $5 million for its much-needed renovations. We are working hard on our commitment to launch the National Cultural Policy and change the trajectory of the sector after this decade of neglect. This will put arts back at the centre of all aspects of life and policy in Australia, where it belongs, and I am very proud to be part of a government that is going to stand up for our arts sector, the jobs involved and the intrinsic importance of arts to Australian life.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Barker</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:56</span>):  Reputations are often hard-won. But this newly minted government that has now spent six months in charge has earned a reputation for itself very quickly—the reputation that this is a government that says one thing before an election and one very different thing after the election. Picking up something the member for Canberra just said, it's a government that's pretty heavy on the yap—the talk. You would think that those opposite hadn't spent nine years in opposition preparing for their time in the sun, but they did. I don't know what they did while they were in opposition, but they certainly didn't develop a suite of policies in this space or in others.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's go back to the issue of saying one thing before an election and another thing after the election, because, as it relates to this bill, I sat in the House day after day after day in the middle of a pandemic, no less, when we were accused of doing nothing for the creative sector and when it was said that we had left artists, actors and musicians behind. Nothing could be further from the truth. We established emergency measures, including RISE, which supported 541 projects over 4,000 locations, with 195,000 direct jobs. You would think those that were so vociferous with their objection would have a plan ready to go on day one, but we just heard from the member for Canberra that they're actively engaging in consultation right now about what their policy should be. If you're an artist, just keep waiting, because what they've done is cancel the very successful RISE program, and in response they'd like you to turn up to a roundtable and tell them what they should be doing. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It sounds a lot like a commitment to a $275 reduction in your energy bill which, of course, was a commitment that was made time and time and time and time again before the election, but there was not a mention of it after. I think the 'Big Daddy' of all the examples of saying one thing before an election and doing something very different after the election was the commitment that the then opposition made via the now Treasurer to indicate that their platform would not involve pattern-bargaining of any shape or form going forward. And, of course, what do we have now? We have an industrial relations bill, a suite of measures, much of which is—</span>

                  </a>  No, I'm speaking to the motion and to the tendency to say one thing before the election, for the member opposite, and one very different thing afterwards. I'm just speaking of the propensity, unlimited as it is, for those opposite to say one thing before the election and one very different thing after the election.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The single most important creative cultural event that takes place in my electorate is Generations in Jazz. This is an event that brings 6,000 school students to a tent in the middle of a paddock. You can appreciate that that wasn't a very COVID-safe environment and, as a result, over a number of years that event was cancelled. It was on its knees, and, at the very time that those opposite were accusing us of turning our backs on the creative industries and the creative sector, I secured a grant of $350,000 for that event. That allowed that event to put on a gala performance, with much of that funding going towards artists who were having a very difficult time during COVID. More importantly, it meant that that event survived. It meant that there was a chance of that event taking place in my community again—6,000 school students travelling to regional South Australia for the ultimate band camp. For those opposite, criticism is one thing, and throwing stones from opposition is very easy. I tell you what's hard: governing. The behaviour of those opposite on this is an indication that they're not up to government.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moreton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:01</span>):  The modern Australian Labor Party is a proud supporter of the Australian arts industry. From Gough Whitlam to Paul Keating's Creative Nation or Julia Gillard's Creative Australia, Labor has a vision for the arts. You don't have to go back far to see what the Liberals and Nationals actually think of the arts portfolio. The Morrison government was so obsessed with culture wars it even removed the word 'arts' from the names of government departments. That was not an Orwellian metaphor; it was a blunt-trauma blow to a major sector of our economy. Under the coalition, the arts endured nearly a decade of cuts and, even worse, interference.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Don't be fooled. The Luddites opposite—with respect to those actually sitting opposite me, the coalition—would talk about the so-called record investment in 2021-22, but there are a few caveats that people should understand. Firstly, when the COVID pandemic first hit, the arts minister, Paul Fletcher, went missing for the first 100 days. As COVID was hitting the arts sector hardest, with mass cancellations of live performances and shows, their minister went into hiding. The Morrison government had to be dragged kicking and screaming to support the arts sector during the pandemic, right when artists desperately needed help.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, when they did finally provide some support, they didn't tell the truth. Minister Fletcher claimed that the arts sector received up to $10 billion in support, which included JobKeeper. What he failed to say was that part of the record funding didn't just go to the arts sector. But, then again, if you don't see the arts as a priority, why would you know the difference? It also went to clothing and footwear wholesaling and retailing, clothing manufacturing, and the jewellery wholesaling and retailing sectors. Call me old-fashioned, but I don't think someone working at the local sports store would be classed as an artist.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite crow about their RISE funding and how great it was for the arts. We heard the member for Barker say that. It was certainly good for William Rose—listeners might actually know him as Axl Rose—because Paul Fletcher provided $1.35 million across two grants for a Guns N' Roses tour. I'm more of a 'Spring Rain' rather than a 'November Rain' sort of guy. But, with Guns N' Roses' back catalogue, they surely didn't require the assistance of Australian taxpayers, especially when many local artists didn't have extensive and lucrative career earnings to fall back on while their local gigs were being cancelled and their incomes disappeared. It's that famous Leppington Triangle style of judgement on show yet again.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition's funding program had no vision, no strategy and no long-term impacts for the arts industry. It's almost as if they're ashamed of Australian stories and Australian storytellers. That's the difference between Labor and the Liberals and Nationals. Compare the arts legacies of Whitlam, Hawke, Keating, Rudd and Gillard to the forelock tuggers opposite—to their knights and dames and false nationalism and divisive culture wars. Because they don't know who they are or what they believe in, all they do is attack Labor's hopeful vision for this nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor, under Tony Burke, is passionate about the arts. Labor wants to assist the sector and leave a proud national legacy. Only last week, right in this building, the Minister for the Arts spoke of his support for our local TV and film industry. I also note that Thelma Plum, who went to Yeronga State High School in my electorate, wanted him to introduce her at every gig after his stellar effort when she was here to promote the ARIAs. What a difference that is to the apathetic approach the Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison governments had to the arts. Labor is currently working on delivering the National Cultural Policy to change the trajectory of this sector after this decade of neglect.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The lack of cultural policy over the past 10 years has contributed to damage, neglect and policy drift in the sector, leaving it even more vulnerable to the cuts of the coalition. The National Cultural Policy will be a broad and comprehensive roadmap for Australia's arts and culture, touching on all areas of government from cultural diplomacy in foreign affairs through to health and education.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know that Minister Burke and the Special Envoy for the Arts, Susan Templeman, attended town hall meetings and received more than 1,300 submissions as part of the consultation process. Some of Australia's finest artistic and creative minds have been a part of this process. They've helped guide the development of the Cultural Policy, and have identified key themes and issues raised in submissions. That is what good governments do: they talk to stakeholders; they listen to what people are saying and they work with people to deliver outcomes. Australia needs a coherent, industry-led and supported policy to guide and support the arts sector for today and into the future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The previous government scrapped Creative Australia and replaced it with nothing, reduced funding of around $11 million to the Australia Council and created a task force to advise on an arts policy when they didn't even have an arts policy. Unlike the coalition, Labor support our arts sectors and I'm excited to see what comes from our National Cultural Policy when it is launched.</span>

They share familiar and unique perspectives; they shape our dreams and imagination; and they affect our wellbeing, our social cohesion, our health, our sense of place, our sense of pride. On the eve of the launch of Australia's first National Cultural Policy in almost a decade, I rise today to share some small stories of the arts from my electorate—the celebrations, the struggles and the opportunities. And I would like to acknowledge in the chamber today the member for Macquarie, who travelled the country consulting on this very policy. This included the border region that I represent, and I thank her for that.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">On a rainy Friday night a few weeks ago I attended the King Valley art show. It was a gala night in Whitfield. This was the triumphant return of a mainstay event of the local cultural scene that was so strong before COVID. I joined over 200 people on that opening night in a tin shed in Whitfield, and I was honoured to meet gala prize winner Jacqueline Macleish, whose painting of the iconic Northo Hotel in Wangaratta won the top gong. There were over 300 artworks displayed illustrating the depth of talent in our community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In celebrating moments like this I will never forget how tough the last few years were for the arts, and I am sad to say the former government dithered in supporting artists when lockdowns first occurred. Many arts workers were excluded from JobKeeper. They've never forgotten it. By the time the former government finally acted, many arts, arts workers and artists had already given up. They left the sector altogether for their own survival and many, sadly, have not returned. So I must say I find it rather rich for a coalition MP to move this motion criticising the last six months after their shameful record of the last decade of arts sabotage, where funding has dwindled or stagnated at a huge cost to our cultural and economic fabric.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Arts and culture sectors don't exist in a vacuum. In regional Victoria they drive tourism, and it has flow-on benefits to our hospitality and accommodation sectors. In Indi, these sectors employ almost 1,000 people. These are the people who teach our kids to play the piano, who teach them to dance. They're the bands that perform in local pubs. They're the artists who perform at the wonderful HotHouse Theatre in Wodonga.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was fortunate to meet with Regional Arts Victoria last week, the peak body for regional artists and arts organisations. It backs artists and communities across regional Victoria to make, participate in and experience creative work. It made a submission to the National Cultural Policy, which I hope the government has considered. One of the issues their member bodies are grappling with are workforce shortages. Even the smallest production requires a team of skilled professionals to pull it off. During COVID there was an exodus of arts workers to other sectors. There aren't enough theatre technicians, and there isn't a training pathway for this highly in demand skill set, particularly in regional areas. So I think we should be considering a skills package to grow our regional arts and culture workforce. There is scope for our TAFE sector to step in and fill this gap. This could explore apprenticeships or subsidised traineeships at local providers. And we need our schools, our careers counsellors and our community leaders to promote the idea locally of having a career in the arts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last month I secured an amendment to require the newly established Jobs and Skills Australia to provide advice to the minister in relation to skills and training and workforce needs in regional, rural and remote Australia. Our arts and culture workforce needs this focus, and I would urge Jobs and Skills Australia to start their work right there, in the arts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also need investment in our local arts infrastructure. The HotHouse Theatre redevelopment in Wodonga would give new life to one of the region's key cultural tourism assets. HotHouse has a rich and celebrated history of commissioning, producing, nurturing and presenting new contemporary Australian theatre right there in regional Australia, and they could do so much more with better facilities. Then there's the Benalla Art Gallery phase 2, the expansion of the gallery space to improve the interface and activities between the gallery, Lake Benalla, the CBD and the magnificent heritage botanical gardens. It's a jewel in our crown, but it's lost its sparkle and it needs investment. I thank directors Karla Conway, from HotHouse, and Eric Nash, from Benalla Art Gallery, for their dogged advocacy on behalf of their communities. These are the resources, these are the people, that will transform and safeguard our local arts and cultural centre to be sustainable and vibrant into the future and position rural and regional Australia as a shining light in arts and culture.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="181810" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms TEMPLEMAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macquarie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:11</span>):  I want to thank the member for Indi, and the member for Moreton before her, for acknowledging my work as Special Envoy for the Arts in the consultation on our National Cultural Policy and, importantly, for their passionate endorsement of the arts sector, which we know is about much more than going and seeing a show; it's about who we are as Australians and the stories that we tell.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Arts portfolio spans a very wide range of activities and programs that enrich and shape people's lives. I'm very much looking forward to the release of the National Cultural Policy, but I want to talk about the work of one lesser-known area of the Arts portfolio, and this is the area that carries out repatriations of ancestral remains from around the world. This falls under the Arts portfolio. I'm proud to be standing in this place wearing two special pins. One is the symbol of the Australian government's Indigenous repatriation program, and I wear it very proudly, having taken part in a repatriation this month in Leipzig, Germany, from where the ancestral remains of six Aboriginal men and women were returned to the safekeeping of community representatives. I accompanied the representatives of the Gadigal, Awabakal, Warrimay and Mutti Mutti people who had been given the responsibility by their communities to bring their old people home.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia cannot truly be at peace with itself as a nation while the journey of reconciliation is incomplete. As the delegation and I travelled to the other side of the world together, they shared with me their hope that we were taking a step closer to reconciliation. There are many injustices that have been perpetrated against Australia's First Nations people that we must acknowledge and strive to put right. In the 19th and 20th centuries, the remains of many First Nations Australians were separated from their country and traded, ultimately ending up in museums around the world. This caused profound and ongoing grief to First Nations people. It should never have happened. These ancestors should never have been taken away from their country. Several community representatives in the delegation told me that repatriation of ancestors is a crucial part of the process of healing, truth-telling and reconciliation. Because of this repatriation, these ancestors can return to country where they belong.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has supported the repatriation of ancestors from overseas for more than 30 years, and, yes, it happens through the department of the arts. Since 1990 more than 1,600 ancestors have been returned to Australia. I pay tribute to the state of Saxony, the State Ethnographic Collections of Saxony and the Grassi museum for this repatriation, particularly Leontine Meijer-van Mensch, director; Birgit Scheps-Bretschneider, curator of the Australian and South Pacific collections; and Juliane Heinze, all of whom made it possible for these ancestors to come home.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The German museums are doing nothing wrong right now. They are trying to right a wrong that occurred in the past. I thank them for the respect that they've shown to First Nations community representatives who are there to collect the remains that have ended up in their institutions. The repatriation sets an example that other institutions should look to. Many of the museums who've agreed to repatriations have found that the process has opened a new chapter in their histories. In many instances, it has led to constructive and positive relationships between the museums and Indigenous people in which knowledge can be shared and important new dialogues opened.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to acknowledge the representatives who travelled with me as part of the delegation: Rowena Welsh, Kaleana Reyland, David Feeney and Kumarah Kelly, who were joined by Nathan Moran, Jennah Dungay, Lindsay Munro and Jacqueline Gibbs, as well as Worimi man Jamie Tarrant. That brings me to the second special pin, which he asked me to wear in this place. It represents the Worimi Conservation Lands that he cares for around Nelson Bay, and I'm very proud to wear it. Thank you all for including me on your journey and letting me see your strength, your vulnerability, your generosity and your dignity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to acknowledge the staff of the Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development, Communications and the Arts for their diligent work in negotiating the repatriation of these ancestors and for the sensitivity they've shown in doing so—director David Doble and assistant director Amanda Morley and the team. Without David's commitment and Amanda's determination we would not have had ancestral remains being returned. They have much work to do, and I look forward to our government supporting even more work in this area to bring people home.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government was elected on a platform of a better future for all Australians regardless of whether they live in our cities, our suburbs or out in our regions. This is a platform that we are wasting no time in affirming our commitment to and delivering on. A large part of this platform will tighten up the digital divide that we currently see in Australia between our cities and our regions. There is no denying that, after nine long years of mismanagement by the former Liberal and National government, the digital divide has widened and many people have been left behind. We have a very big multitechnology mess to clean up.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For nine years, let's be frank, the previous government completely bungled the NBN rollout. They turned what could have been a world-leading program into a slow paced and uneven system of broadband connectivity. Just imagine if they'd continued what had been started. So many more—millions more—households would be connected to full fibre. That would be good not just for consumers; it would be good for business, health services and education. Yet what they did was start all over again, and they made a mess of it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition's record on the NBN is a masterclass in what not to do. It truly highlights their complete economic and technological incompetence. I've got to say that when former Prime Minister Abbott made his comments about the country's broadband needs, you could have forgiven him, because this wasn't his area of expertise, let's be frank. But when Prime Minister Turnbull came along, here was a man who understood technology, and he understood finance. He understood what should've happened and, frankly, I think it was a great disappointment that, under Prime Minister Turnbull in particular, the NBN rollout was allowed to continue to be such a mess.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Through delays and cost blowouts, the coalition's initial promise was to build the NBN for $29 billion—something the Labor Party said couldn't happen. But the Liberals were adamant: the Liberals said they'd build it for $29 billion. Well, that soon turned into $41 million and then $49 billion. It actually ended up costing $58 billion—double the cost—and the quality is half what it could've been. If we had continued with the NBN as Labor had initially designed it, we would have a full-blown NBN, full fibre-optic to 93 per cent of the population, from memory, for probably less than that amount. So not only does this cost blowout prove that those opposite can't manage a budget and show financial responsibility, but the delays of the rollout caused Australia to trail other developed countries on broadband quality and speeds; they leapfrogged us. The previous government did nothing but bungle the NBN and leave Australians behind in a technological dark age. If those opposite were in power today, sadly, this would still be the case.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Only this month Senator Sarah Henderson described expanding fibre access to more Australians as 'wasting taxpayers' funds'—unbelievable. The fact is the coalition is more than happy to leave regional Australians in the dark with poor internet reliability and speeds. Labor are not. We are determined to close the digital divide that those opposite failed to do. Unlike the coalition, the Albanese government firmly believes in enabling the NBN's full potential. We have a proud history of backing and developing our technological capacity through the NBN. It was Labor who founded the NBN with the purpose of providing fast, reliable and affordable broadband to all Australians. It is a legacy that remains true today and it remains this government's goal for the NBN.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the 21st century access to reliable broadband is not a luxury or privilege; it is a necessity. The COVID-19 pandemic taught us about the importance of reliable broadband for all Australians. The Albanese government will expand full-fibre access to 1.5 million premises by 2025 with a $2.4 billion equity investment over four years in this budget. This will ensure faster and more reliable NBN to more Australians, including many throughout the regions. We are determined to close the digital divide that those opposite failed to do. We built the NBN originally, we are back on track and we are going to make sure the NBN is fit for the purpose into the future.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Indi</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:22</span>):  I thank the member for Lyons for this important motion. I'm encouraged by the government's budget commitment to improve the NBN, which is critical technology that has been substandard for far too long. But let me say 'I am watching you' because Australians should be able to connect to the internet no matter where they are. It is an essential service as vital as water, electricity or roads but for too long those in the regions, including in my electorate of Indi, have not received the fast, reliable internet that our city cousins are benefiting from. The promise originally was bold but the disappointment has been bitter.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Constituents frequently contact me about the woeful speeds of the NBN. These constituents are businesses, doctors, students, older people, younger people. The Mitta Mitta Brewing Company recently told me that on weekends the NBN is so slow it can completely drop out and they can't use their EFTPOS machine. That's a pub with free beer if you can't charge the customer. We need to get this fixed. In Beechworth GP clinics installed NBN only to discover it is so unreliable that it becomes a health hazard when telehealth services constantly drop out. Constituents from Kinglake and Marysville, communities that were significantly impacted by the 2009 Black Saturday bushfires, contact me, fearing the next disaster event, when committees will struggle to stay informed and connected because the NBN speeds are just so poor.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One constituent contacted me only last month sharing her frustrations. She said this: 'I feel the NBN service is extremely subpar here and well below what was promised. Not being able to join web-based hosting services not just affects my work but it potentially affects web-based learning because I'm a part-time university student and it affects my capacity with telehealth services, to name just a couple of vital things I need it for.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Professor Ross Garnaut recently wrote in his book <span style="font-style:italic;">The Superpower Transformation</span> that connectivity to internet services as a main hurdle standing in a way of low- and zero-emissions economic growth in rural Australia. This is particularly so for the farm sector, who, without connectivity, cannot take advantage of technologies dealing with weed spraying, renewable energy production or labour efficiencies. So, clearly, quality NBN is not just about streaming your favourite movie or playing a video game. A fast, reliable NBN is about health, education, jobs, food production and knowing what to do when the next bushfire happens.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since my election, I have worked hard to offer solutions to this problem. In the last parliament, I introduced the Telecommunications Legislation Amendment (Faster Internet for Regional Australia) Bill 2022, and the purpose of the bill was simple: to ensure all regional Australians have access to fast, high-quality and reliable internet at the same standard our city cousins enjoy. The bill aimed to achieve this by establishing solid standards that the NBN and other companies who own and operate broadband infrastructure must meet to avoid facing financial penalties. Under the bill, the NBN must deliver a minimum of 25 megabits per second at all times of the day on average—not at three in the morning but all day. By comparison, right now constituents tell me the NBN in their houses serves up an average of 11 to 14 megabits per second. Sometimes it's as slow as five megabits per second. And it's not just in their houses; it's in their businesses too.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">People are usually shocked to learn that no internet standards like those I proposed in that bill exist right now. It's quite shocking. What this means is that, in regional electorates like mine, there is no competition and there is no incentive for NBN to provide a high level of service. I recently met with the Minister for Communications to talk about improving standards for internet providers, and I look forward to working more closely with this government to enshrine in legislation—not in regulations but in legislation—the highest standards we should expect from statutory providers like the NBN.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Indi we've also formed the Indi Telecommunications Advisory Group, which I've steered since 2019. It was established before me by my predecessor. This group comprises representatives from all of our local government areas and from the telecommunications companies, as well as citizens who are highly skilled in this area. We've developed community-led responses to connectivity issues like those we see in the NBN. It's initiatives like these that show I can offer well-researched community-led solutions to work with NBN, because without good internet regional committees are held back from reaching their potential as the engine room of this nation.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="263547" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms COKER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Corangamite</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:27</span>):  I begin by thanking the member for Lyons for introducing this important private member's motion. It is great to be in government, because now we can begin to fix the woefully slow and unpredictable NBN delivered by the previous coalition government. This is an issue for many in my electorate, particularly in fast-growing new housing estates like Mount Duneed, Armstrong Creek, North Torquay and Leopold. Many of these estates are just a few kilometres from the Geelong CBD, yet often their fixed wireless or other NBN service fails to deliver adequate data to stream a video or to work from home. Other townships on the Bellarine Peninsula, which are still receiving the NBN through old copper wire lines, find that they struggle, often only getting a trickle of data.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Before the Albanese government was elected, I implored the then coalition government to fix these frustrations for people living in my electorate. Almost 10 years on, the previous coalition government have failed to deliver. As a result, a large proportion of my constituency work in Corangamite relates to poor NBN. To put it bluntly, the coalition rolled out to Australians a cobbled-together mishmash of technologies. Today the NBN is prone, because of the decisions of the previous government, to dropouts. We have massive gaps, and it is incapable of delivering the speeds residents and businesses expect in 2022.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was a Labor government which originally established the NBN. Labor set out to provide quality broadband to all Australians. We had a plan to do that, using the best available technologies, but the Abbott, Turnbull and Morrison governments then mutilated the plan. Firstly, the coalition promised to build the NBN for $29 billion. It then became $41 billion and then $49 billion, and it ended up actually costing $58 billion—double the cost. The coalition told us the NBN rollout was complete, but that would be a very big surprise to the many families, home based businesspeople, GPs, pubs and schools who can't even get usable NBN in my electorate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition sunk an eye-watering amount of taxpayers' funds into procuring out-of-date technology. Who will forget the purchase of 60,000 kilometres of new but obsolete copper wire, enough to wrap around planet earth one and a half times? At the time, the experts told the coalition that it was a waste of taxpayers' money, but they went ahead anyway. Unlike the coalition, the Albanese government believes in enabling the NBN's full potential because, in the 21st century, reliable broadband is not a luxury; it is a necessity. The pandemic demonstrated the importance of reliable broadband as more Australians learned, worked, received medical assessments and transacted remotely.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government has wasted no time announcing the expansion of full fibre access to 1.5 million premises by 2025. This will be done with the $2.4 billion equity investment over four years announced in the October federal budget. It will deliver a faster and more reliable NBN to more families, communities and businesses. Our plan will give Australians, who now rely on slow copper connections, the choice of having faster full fibre connections to their premises. Labor's plan is to make sure that households and businesses in the regions are not left behind.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The $2.5 billion provided to NBN to upgrade 1.5 million premises to full fibre access includes $1.1 billion for a further 660,000 homes and businesses in the regions currently relying on copper wire. It builds on our fixed wireless upgrade, which we're already delivering, with $480 million provided towards a $750 million upgrade of the NBN fixed wireless network. Network coverage will be expanded to cover an extra 150,000 premises that have satellite-only access, and all 755,000 premises in the expanded footprint will be able to access speeds of up to 100 megabits per second, with 85 per cent able to access up to 250 megabits per second. The upgrade will also deliver wholesale business-hour speeds of at least 50 megabits per second. The Albanese government's investment will ensure that around 10 million homes and businesses across Australia will have access to gigabyte speeds by late 2025.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This investment has the potential to deliver an estimated $20 billion in uplift in GDP by 2030 and will help to grow our global competitiveness. It will help to support thousands of jobs for construction workers, engineers and project managers in our regions and suburbs. The Albanese government's plan is to ensure that Australian families, businesses and communities are able to access the broadband services they deserve because reliable access is not a luxury; it is a necessity.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Ms McKENZIE:</span>
                  </a>  How could the NBN be, as the member for Lyon asserts, a masterclass of technological incompetence and financial mismanagement when, by the time of the federal election this year, the NBN had in fact, made ready for connection 12.1 million Australian homes, of which 8.5 had in fact been connected; given 5.1 million homes access to ultra-fast speeds of up to a gigabit per second through either fibre to the premises or HFC; created 304 business fibre zones, 127 of them in regional Australia, connecting more than 1.5 million businesses to enterprise ethernet, more than 315,000 of them in non-metropolitan areas; more than doubled its revenue between 2018 and 2022 from $1.9 billion to $5.1 billion; and, indeed, reduced the debt outstanding on the Commonwealth's loan from $19.5 billion originally to $6.4 billion? Does this sound like technological incompetence and financial mismanagement? I don't think so.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When Labor conceived of the NBN, the internet was largely an email based system in the home. At the time, only 70 per cent of Australian homes had access to the internet, the majority through digital subscriber line services, the old DSL. The average monthly household download was minuscule. Download speeds were measured in kilobytes per second. Today it is over 500 gigabytes a month, and download speeds are up to one gigabit per second. I have news to break to the government. The speed of the internet received in the family home or small business depends largely on the speed selected by the household or the business. Today roughly three-quarters of all residential and business customers are connected to plans with download speeds of 50 megabits and above. Of those, slightly less than 20 per cent have opted for a speed of 100 megabits or higher. That is, in their judgement, enough for their needs. For millions of households and small businesses, 50 megabits per second does everything they need, enabling them to operate multiple devices and run streaming and video conferencing simultaneously.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Prior to the election, vast improvements were already underway, funded by NBN revenue, not by taxpayer dollars. By the time of the federal election in late May, hundreds and thousands of Australian homes were already able to elect to upgrade to fibre-to-the-premises connections from their existing fibre-to-the-node connections if that, indeed, was what they wanted. When Labor promised an NBN, it promised an unobtainable dream and it delivered a train wreck. The full Rudd fantasy was a network serving 90 per cent of homes with speeds of up to 100 megabits per second, to be completed within eight years, at a cost of $43 billion. All it takes is a cursory look at the corporate statements of NBN at the time that the Rudd government lost power to see the truth of what was actually delivered. In 2012 the NBN corporate plan had a target of 286,000 premises for June 2013. In June 2013 the NBN fell a full 100,000 premises short of its own target. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It took a Liberal-National government to get the NBN back on track, and, if I may say so, it took an exceptional group of telco, governance, finance, construction, legal and public policy experts leading the NBN to deliver the ubiquitous high-quality NBN that Australians enjoy today. I served with many of those people—people of the calibre of Ziggy Switkowski, Kate McKenzie, Drew Clarke, Michael Malone, Andrew Dix, Kerry Schott, Patrick Flannigan, Justin Milne, Shirley In't Veld, Bill Morrow and, of course, the great Stephen Rue, among others. There was no finer government business enterprise board. It steered NBN through massive change and significant risk, through natural disasters and, indeed, through the global pandemic. It was precisely due to the leadership of that board and the company's senior management that Australia was able to continue to function through the pandemic. For schooling, further study, health, work, weddings, funerals, arts and culture, traffic levels rose by 70 per cent during the day. Our entire lives all went online almost without a glitch or a silent buffering wheel.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor has no shame. This government has tried to paint NBN's self-funded 2020 announcement of a $4.5 billion upgrade as a change in direction from the Multi Technology Mix rollout. It is nothing of the sort. That upgrade was consistently aligned with the coalition's long-term strategy, set out as early as 2013, when it shifted from Labor's plan—a plan which overpromised and underdelivered. The coalition's plan was to build an NBN that Australians actually needed and wanted. As demand for higher speeds emerged, upgrades to the network were made, and they continue to be made, using the full gamut of global improvements in telecommunications technology and know-how.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gilmore</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:38</span>):  I thank the member for Lyons for this motion. There is no better example of the former government's failure on the NBN than in regional Australia. My electorate of Gilmore on the New South Wales South Coast has been hampered by second-rate internet for far too long, holding us back from the world of opportunity that high-quality connectivity can bring. The pandemic was a very difficult time, but one thing it did do was free up the possibility of remote working. What this meant was that people who had previously moved away from regional Australia to get the jobs they wanted could actually move back to their home towns. People who had never lived in regional Australia before could make their tree or sea change and keep their jobs, because they could work from home. It was great news for local economies, if only you could find somewhere with good enough internet. Local people have been struggling with connectivity issues for far too long, and they have had enough.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Adam, in Nowra, said: 'We've had issues with the old lines and our NBN for about five years. We've been told only the new fibre-to-the-premises rollout will fix it.' Robert, from Worrigee, said: 'We are forced to use the ADSL2 Telstra network, which is currently falling to pieces. Our current download speeds are typically two megabits per second, worse than a Third World country.' Thomas, from Falls Creek, said he has four kids and his partner is a teacher, but the speed and amount of internet is below par. I think that's putting it mildly.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Kail from Bateman's Bay said, 'In the wake of COVID, it's been shown time and again that our current network infrastructure is woefully out of date.' He went on to say: 'This comes as no surprise. We know fibre to the node was outdated technology when the Liberals proposed it. The whole country needs a fibre-to-the-premises upgrade, the Gilmore electorate included.' Well, Kail, we agree. Under the Liberals, Kail was quoted $13,000 for an upgrade to fibre to the premises, but the Albanese government doesn't think local people should be out thousands of dollars because of the Liberal's failed internet. We believe in small business, and we know that small business needs internet that is fast, reliable and affordable. Labor created the NBN. We did this because we knew that Australians needed a futureproof internet service that was worthy of the 21st century.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, we are delivering that for local people, with 1.5 million premises around Australia to be upgraded to full fibre access under our plan. This includes $1.1 billion for a further 660,000 homes and businesses in regional Australia, like the New South Wales South Coast, that are relying on copper wire. We will also improve speeds and reliability for people on the fixed wireless and satellite-only services. I am regularly contacted by local people who want to know when they will get it, because they are anxious and excited to reap the benefits of our NBN plan and we have already started. In September, homes and businesses in Bendalong, Berringer Lake, Cunjurong Point and Manyana could finally place their orders to upgrade to fibre to the premises.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, these local people could take advantage of faster speeds, more reliable internet and the services that we need for a digital society and economy. We are making this investment because we know it doesn't benefit only local people; it benefits our economy. Around 10 million homes and businesses across Australia will have access to gigabit speeds by late 2025, giving our economy a $20 billion boost in GDP by 2030. It will grow our global competitiveness, but it will also grow the competitiveness of the regions. With improved internet speed, access and reliability, businesses and workers will have even more reason to relocate to the South Coast. There will be even more reason to invest in our community to create local jobs, to open small local businesses and to thrive in our beautiful coastline.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the Liberals' failed NBN plan, our community has been left behind. Local people have been left frustrated by internet that wasn't up to scratch. Local businesses have been forced to cope with slow speeds and forced to miss out on many of the benefits of the digital economy. We have missed out on the working-from-home opportunities that the pandemic has created. If a major company wanted to set up a remote working hub in the regions, they would first look to the technology potential.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, thanks to the Albanese government's plans, the South Coast will be a strong competitor. This huge investment is good news for local people, good news for local business and great news for our economy. I commend the motion.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="291387" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr HAMILTON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Groom</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:43</span>):  Contrary to what has been raised by those opposite in this motion today, the coalition's track record on the NBN is a clear win. We inherited a train wreck project from Labor, and, through hard work and very sensible management, we were able to turn it around, so that by the end of our time in government, over 99 per cent of Australians were connected to the NBN.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to reflect quickly on some of the comments. To hear the debate, you would think there were two very different Australias being spoken about—one where there was an NBN for people and one where there was not. What proves the point that the NBN was there is that we did have an incredible switch to working from home throughout the pandemic. It happened. The NBN was there, and it was used at a time when we needed it. The very suggestion that somehow it was missing is completely blown away by the simple facts. In my area, we've had people flock to the regions. In fact, the migration that we saw from all the capital cities to the regions was only possible because the NBN was there, so that people could work from home. So this mythology of something that went missing or simply wasn't there is just completely disproved by the pure facts of movement that we've seen across the nation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate of Groom, we were one of the first in the country to be connected to the NBN, way back in 2013—what a good year for Australia that was—with crucial upgrades to speed and reliability delivered over the following years under the coalition. Most recently, in April of this year, the Toowoomba region was announced as part of the seventh tranche of suburbs and towns across Australia to become eligible to upgrade to NBN's fibre to the premises rollout, with businesses and residences benefiting from the ultrafast broadband of up to one gigabyte per second. The fibre-to-the-premises rollout will see 75 per cent of premises, eight million in total, connecting with ultrafast speeds by the end of next year. My region was also the beneficiary of being one of the NBN's business fibre zones which were established in 300 locations under the previous government's watch. The initiative gave more than 850,000 small businesses access to lower cost, higher speed broadband, and this was a game changer in the way that business was done in our region. It prepared us well for the challenges of a fully remote working model during COVID, as I referred to earlier.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With access to fast broadband speed, businesses in my area were able to buy and sell goods here and overseas and upskill their staff through online programs. I also know of several business leaders working for large corporate firms who were able to come back out of places like Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane, and move back to Toowoomba to run their business from there. And who wouldn't? We've got everything you could possibly want and need in our beautiful Garden City and you can get away from the drudgery of inner-city living. I see those opposite agreeing quite violently, and I'll enjoy their contribution later. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Regional digital infrastructure was an ongoing priority of the previous coalition government because we understand that regional towns don't just need roads and bridges, although we do need roads and bridges, but we also need the cabling and satellites that connect us digitally to the world we work in. That's why we announced, back in March, that $480 million would be included in the 2022-23 federal budget to significantly improve the capability of NBN's fixed wireless and satellite networks. That was to give up to one million premises in regional, rural, remote and peri-urban areas access to higher speeds on NBN fixed wireless services or greater data limits on Sky Muster. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Thanks to an expansion in the fixed wireless footprint, it would also enable more regional users to transition to this service and off Sky Muster. Unsurprisingly, this is another coalition announcement that Labor have tried to take credit for. As we keep seeing in this new term of government, they run out of ideas and they take ours, and I think that's a great thing. A good idea is a good idea, whether it's ours or whether it's taken, and I encourage more of that. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 27 June this year, the communications minister tried to assign herself credit for the Liberal-Nationals $480 million decision, but this simply wasn't true, and it exposed Labor's negligible interest in delivering communications infrastructure across rural and regional Australia. We can't forget that, when Labor was last in government, it connected just 51,000 users to the NBN and failed to fix a single mobile blackspot. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Turning now to Labor's $2.4 billion cash injection into the NBN, the Albanese government has irresponsibly hit taxpayers with an unnecessary multibillion dollar burden at a time when our budget bottom line simply can't afford it. This is the complete opposite of the approach the coalition took with its $4.5 billion investment into the NBN in 2020. We financed our investment through the NBN's retained earnings and private sector loans, meaning no additional investment by the Commonwealth or taxpayers was required. </span>

I also agree with the member for Groom who recognised that the NBN was critical for Australia's response to the COVID pandemic. It was critical in helping kids to continue their education, critical in helping families to stay connected and critical in terms of helping businesses to stay open. Over the last two years, the reliance on services over the NBN has never been greater, so it is worth considering the history of the NBN and the decisions made by successive governments to deliver this critical piece of infrastructure.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was 2009 when then Prime Minister Kevin Rudd announced the beginning of a new National Broadband Network strategy. The plan was to build fibre to the premises. This would be a quantum leap from the existing unreliable national internet infrastructure that relied primarily on copper cabling. It was a bold plan. It was visionary and it was the plan that Australia needed. Quite in contrast to what the member for Groom just said, almost immediately, the Liberals opposed it. Tony Abbott, as the Leader of the Opposition, said in 2010 that they would, 'demolish the NBN because it wasn't necessary'. Soon thereafter, the shadow communications minister, Malcolm Turnbull, said that there would be no demand for the services that the NBN would deliver, and it was not required in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly, after the 2013 election, the Liberals got their hands on Labor's NBN and almost immediately they began to vandalise it. The Liberals' plan was to replace the largely fibre-to-the-premises model initiated by the Labor government with what they called a multitechnology mix or MTM model, including a range of old technologies including fibre to the node, fibre to the curb and hybrid fibre coaxial cable.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The changes to the NBN under the Liberals are some of the worst public policy decisions in Australia's history. The consequence of the move to the MTM model has ended up costing Australia taxpayers billions of dollars more than the deep fibre NBN original model and will result in a network that is considerably less capable of meeting the nation's future internet needs. The Liberals' policy took the visionary NBN and turned it into three kinds of disaster. First of all, it was a financial disaster.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The mixed technology approach was supposed to be much cheaper than full fibre. Malcolm Turnbull told us it would be much less expensive. First he promised it would cost just $29 billion but then this will successfully revised upwards, first to $41 billion then to $49 billion and then to $58 billion. The Liberals went a bit wrong in their financial forecasts. This was not a small forecast error; they were out by a factor of two. The cost was double. They were 100 per cent wrong in their forecast of the cost of their new model. As a result, their NBN model became one of the biggest blowouts of public financial projections in a decade. The cost blowout makes a mockery of Liberals' claims to be prudent financial managers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Not only was the additional build cost disastrous but the changes to the NBN also degraded the ongoing financial position of the network. The financial health of the NBN is a function of its cash flow, which in turn is a function of revenue and operating costs, and the original model was a relatively low-cost operating model with minimal need for upgrade or maintenance. But the current NBN is beset with additional costs, not only the additional costs which we are now experiencing of upgrading the network through additional capital spend but also additional costs of ongoing maintenance of a much more complex and fragile network using a mix of technologies, all of which are approaching the end of their life-cycle. For both of these reasons, the future cash flows of the NBN have been burdened by these additional costs, weighing down the long-term viability of the NBN. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Second, the new NBN model is operationally disastrous. Rather than having a clear, reliable, high-speed fibre NBN, we have an NBN which delivers worse reliability through inferior technologies. Now we are having to change that but years and billions of dollars have been wasted.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, the changes to the NBN were economically disastrous. We have a wasted decade of opportunity, a wasted decade of when we could have been surging ahead with the digital economy, a wasted decade when we could have been moving our digital economy forward. Australians know who to blame: Liberals, the hubris of Malcolm Turnbull and the incompetence of the member for Bradfield as communications minister. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="176304" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr STEVENS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Sturt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:53</span>):  I rise to speak on the motion of the member for Lyons and against the proposition within it. I start by making the comment that there are some things we will never know and, luckily, one of them is what a financial disaster NBN would have become if the Labor Party did not lose the 2013 federal election. At that point in time, we know the grim statistics: there were only 51,000 properties connected to the NBN six years after Labor were elected in 2007 and started the rollout of their plan. At that rate, come 10 years later, where we are right now, we would have about half a million properties connected to the NBN instead of the situation we are in now thanks to the coalition winning the 2013 election, with more than 12 million properties having access to the NBN.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the speakers—I think it was the member for Groom—mentioned earlier how the NBN was put through a very significant test COVID in 2020, when a dramatic increase of capability and requirement was put onto that network and of course it passed with flying colours. There was evidence of its ability to handle that dramatic increase in demand as so many people suddenly needed to work from home. It was resilient. It was able to handle that dramatic increase in demand as so many people suddenly wished to—or needed to—work from home and do a whole range of things with their technology. This wasn't the usual load on the system, and it included, let's be honest, accessing entertainment and streaming services et cetera to get through the struggles of isolation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are actually very proud of the NBN that has been built. One of the points that the now government have made in criticism of our NBN is the cost of it. Well, they've equally said that ours was one designed to save money, so if our NBN budget blew out then God knows what the cost would have been for the platinum scheme that Labor were planning on pursuing had the government not changed in 2013.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The most important thing is that we've always been aware of a mix of technology being the solution to many problems, and one of them is providing appropriate connectivity services to the people of Australia and the businesses of Australia. The Labor Party had a one-size-fits-all approach to that. They wanted fibre to the premises going to all properties everywhere, whether or not those properties wanted it, and they were treating every single consumer as having the exact same financial capacity to access the system and the exact same financial capacity to pay for it—and that is clearly not the case.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know, in the 15 years since the NBN was conceived, where technology is right now. We know what Elon Musk is doing with the Starlink system, just as one example, and what's that doing in Ukraine right now to help with remote connectivity. We don't know where that type of direct satellite technology could be in the years ahead. It's the same with the 5G spectrum, which has now been rolled out, and the 6G spectrum is around the corner. Also, what might wi-fi might do with the Internet of Things.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The point is you can choose one single solution at one point in time to meet the technology needs of the future and you could spend tens of billions or hundreds of billions of dollars on that system. Or you can invest in a sensible way that uses a mix of technologies. You can recognise that technology will change into the future and that all kinds of things could come along to open up more and different opportunities that you could not conceive at the time. That was always the great fault and flaw of Kevin Rudd's NBN.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, we saw how horribly that could go wrong with the pink batts and school halls. Luckily, they were so terrible at rolling out the NBN they only got 51,000 homes done by the time the 2013 election came along. We were able to put some sensible changes in place to that system. So instead of an enormous financial burden falling upon the Commonwealth, we were able to make a change that now means 99 per cent of homes—more than 12 million premises—have access to the NBN. They have it through a suite of technologies and they can choose what service they need, suitable to their needs and suitable to their capacity to pay, and the taxpayer is not burdened by what would have been a blow-out of tens of billions of dollars if we had proceeded with the Kevin Rudd one-size-fits-all system back then. The coalition are very proud of our record on the NBN and how it will deliver for Australia into the future.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't think there's anyone in this place who has not mentioned the phrase 'affordable living' in the last four or five months. On a personal note, my wife was away and so I went down the supermarket. I didn't have to buy any meat—there was plenty of that in the fridge—and I spent $363. I nearly died of shock! I have Phoenician ancestors. They invented money, and I've had a very great attachment to it throughout my life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 1990, the average household in Australia spent $92 a week on food. They're now having to spend $279 a week on food. That is a 2020 figure and there has been a huge escalation in food prices in the last two years. That's a 229 per cent increase in the price of food. The average weekly earnings have gone up only 150 per cent. So the average weekly earner is being short-changed by 80 bucks a week. The CPI, which pensions are attached to, has gone up by 110 per cent. So food's gone up by 230 per cent, but average weekly earnings have only gone up by 150 per cent and the pension has gone up by only 110 per cent. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, on a basket of key items that we took—and I must emphasise that we did not get a full basket—the mark-up in Woolworths and Coles 20 years ago was 106 per cent. The average mark-up now is 242 per cent. There have been 15 inquiries into Woolworths and Coles in this place and not a single thing has been done; not a single recommendation has been put into practice. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 1991, Woolworths and Coles held 50.5 per cent of the market; that's all. When a really searching inquiry was done in 2001, their percentage of the market was, according to the ABS, 68 per cent and, according to global world ANOP, 72 per cent. They'd gone from 50 per cent to over 70 per cent in the space of 10 years. There's no doubt that they're up around 90 per cent now. So we have a duopoly. When I went to university and did economics they said that it was very, very bad to have a duopoly. I'll say it's bad. Woolworths and Coles can give themselves a 229 per cent pay increase, whilst the poor struggling pensioner got only a 110 per cent increase in the money that he receives. And I find that the CEO of Woolworths is struggling along on $8 million a year and the CEO of Coles is struggling along on $7½ million a year. I feel so sorry for them!</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the same period of time, there were 16,000 dairy farmers; there are now 6,000. We had 2½ thousand in Queensland. We now have about 400 in Queensland and, as you yourself are well aware, Madam Deputy Speaker Sharkie, many of them exited in the most terrible of ways. The highest suicide rate in Australia was recorded in the heart of the Atherton Tablelands, the densest dairying area in Australia. </span>

I went up to a Rural Action meeting three days later and they kicked my head in—I was still a member of the National Party then—and so I should have had my head kicked in. I asked them to vote for this bloke. They said, 'What's he up to—advocating that we get rid of 100,000 farmers!' Well, now we have 83,000 farmers, and whose fault is that? Throughout those years, what was the government that introduced free markets into every one of these things? A free market meant Woolworths and Coles had a free-fire zone to push us down through the floor.

                  <a href="157125" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms ROBERTS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Pearce</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:03</span>):  I rise today to speak about agriculture and the motion that has been proposed. In my thriving electorate of Pearce, the economic contribution made by the agribusiness sector is significant and important to the state of Western Australia and the nation. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Local pioneers farmed the land for generations and many of those families still work the land today as highly successful producers of wonderful fresh fruit and vegetables which are consumed locally, intrastate, interstate and overseas. A true strength that bolsters a region's output is its multigenerational knowledge. These are innovative people who understand the land, the climate, the soils, and the challenges they face as growers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The area is part of a regional agricultural ecosystem collectively referred to as the north of Perth food zone. Wanneroo sits at the southern point of this approximately $1 billion per annum regional food zone. It produces over 60 agricultural products that play a vital role in the food production chain and critical linkage to local suburban markets and the nation's future food security.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The region provides an important source of high-quality, healthy local produce. More than 17.5 per cent of Western Australia's total vegetable production takes place in my electorate of Pearce, including 70 per cent sweet corn, 35 per cent strawberries, 20 per cent capsicum and 20 per cent beans. This booming agricultural industry benefits from its proximity to industrial development areas and potential supply chain linkages, including the Neerabup industrial area and the metropolitan food supply chain.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Not only is the agricultural industry in Pearce important for feeding communities and ensuring we continue to have fresh produce; it is also a significant job creator, contributing to economic activity and growth, economic diversity and tourism. I always advocate for the growers to ensure they have the support systems and processes in place to enable them to continue to thrive and contribute to the local and national economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia exports around 70 per cent of our agricultural production. We are a net exporter. Australia exported nearly $4.9 billion of fruit and veg, including preserved fruits, in the year to this September 2022. Over the same time period, Australia imported around 2.8 billion of those commodities, which is about 58 per cent of the value of what we exported.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Protecting our agricultural sector is important to the Albanese Labor government. In August, we released Australia's first National Biosecurity Strategy that outlines the key actions to ensure a stronger biosecurity system. The National Biosecurity Strategy provides clear direction to ensure our system stays fit to meet the challenges of the next decade and beyond and is ready for the biosecurity threats we face.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our October budget further supports our biosecurity commitment. It provides a $134 million investment in frontline staff, stronger defence against the threat of exotic pests and diseases and 20 new detector dogs. The Albanese Labor government is also supporting extensive research and biosecurity. We are trialling a range of innovative technologies, including new 3D X-ray technology, eDNA diagnostics, and automated detection algorithms for biosecurity risk materials.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Regarding country-of-origin labelling, the Albanese Labor government has committed to working with the seafood and hospitality sectors to implement mandatory country-of-origin labelling. The labelling enables consumers to make informed choices about where the products they buy are made, produced and grown. Measures under Australian Consumer Law also provide protections against false and misleading claims, including on product origin.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese Labor government is committed to working with industry to explore opportunities to improve price and market transparency to enhance productivity, profitability and sustainability of the agricultural sector. It has successfully progressed legislation amendments to strengthen protections for consumers and small businesses, including primary producers, by making unfair contract terms illegal, as they should be. The legislation also provides a larger number of small businesses with protections due to changes in the eligibility threshold. The Albanese Labor government is committed to working with and supporting the agricultural industry to access the workers it needs. It is important to ensure we have local jobs for local people.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="282335" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr HAINES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Indi</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:09</span>):  I'm pleased to rise today to speak on the motion from the member for Kennedy, who, like me, is an independent member who proudly and passionately supports regional and rural Australia. Like the member for Kennedy, I support Australian agriculture, and I want to see government policies that support the Australian agricultural sector, policies that better educate and inform consumers about where their producers come from and what goes into getting it from the paddock to their plate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Indi we have a diverse range of agricultural industries, including beef and dairy farming; fat lambs; wool; fruit such as cherries, berries, apples; and more. I will focus on a different element of labelling from that which the member for Kennedy is focusing on. I want to tell you today that, when it comes to Australian wine, what's on the label matters. An incredibly important part of our agricultural industry in Indi is viticulture, with major wine regions in the King Valley, Rutherglen, Beechworth, the alpine valleys, the Strathbogie Ranges, Glenrowan and the upper Goulburn. But a major part of our viticulture industry is facing a very serious challenge, and I'm calling on our government to do all it can to protect this vital part of our economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I know you understand, Madame Deputy Speaker Sharkie, the Australian government is negotiating a free trade agreement with the European Union, a development which I support and hope will bring significant benefit to Australian farmers, including those farmers in Indi. But, through that agreement, Italy wants to restrict the use of the name prosecco to wine that comes only from a specific area of that country. Now, Madam Deputy Speaker, I know that you know, but other members may not, that 57 per cent of Australia's prosecco comes from the beautiful King Valley in the electorate of Indi. It was in the King Valley that Otto Dal Zotto planted the first prosecco vines in Australia, inspired by remembering his childhood in Valdobbiadene in Italy. I look across the chamber and I see my colleagues nodding and I see the co-chair of the Parliamentary Friends of Viticulture, who saw and met with the people from the King Valley just last week here in parliament.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, in just a few short years, prosecco has grown to be worth $205 million a year in sales alone, with even more value added through the significant tourism that this great wine creates in our region. That's a massive increase from the $60 million in sales in 2017. Even with the challenges created by the COVID-19 pandemic, prosecco is growing, innovating and finding new markets. This is exactly what we want to encourage in Australian agriculture; we don't want to stifle this. If the use of the name prosecco were to be banned for Australian grapegrowers and winemakers, it would have a devastating impact on the wine industry in Indi and across the nation and it would have a chilling effect on the industry more broadly. It would threaten wine sales domestically and internationally, affecting jobs across Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It needs to be said that it was only in 2009 that Italy changed the name of the grape variety to glera and registered prosecco as a geographic indicator in the European Union. In 2013, the Australian wine industry successfully challenged a previous application by the European Union to claim prosecco is a GI in Australia, with recognition that prosecco is a grape variety. If GI status were to be granted to prosecco, it would create a concerning precedent. In recent European Union trade negotiations with China, Japan, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay, Uruguay and New Zealand, attempts were made to protect an expanding list of grape varieties, including prosecco, fiano, montepulciani, barbera, nero d'Avola, alicante, dolcetto and others, as GIs. All of these varieties are grown across Australia's 65 wine regions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week, representatives from Brown Brothers, Pizzini Wines and Dal Zotto Wines travelled to Canberra to ensure that the government knows just how important it is that the use of the name prosecco is not traded away. I am very grateful to the Minister for Trade and Tourism, Don Farrell, and the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Murray Watt, who heard their stories and listened to why prosecco is so important to Australian viticulture and Australian agriculture.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Paterson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:14</span>):  I'm absolutely delighted to speak on this private members' motion put forward by the member for Kennedy, and I thank him for that. I want to speak on the good work and continued commitment of the Albanese government and the great successes that we've had in agriculture in this country. We aren't wasting a minute when it comes to supporting this industry, and that's why the House Standing Committee on Agriculture has decided to hold an inquiry on food security in Australia. Our committee is working closely with the minister to better listen and understand the needs of the agriculture industry and ensure that agricultural security remains a priority area for our government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We understand Australia exports around 70 per cent of our agricultural production, and that's a good thing, but this has an important role to play in our economic prosperity. Equally, we want to ensure that we're supporting industry and encouraging every domestic opportunity available to producers. It has been said that Australia does not produce everything consumers like to eat, and imports account for around 11 per cent of food consumption by value. Some of these imports are largely motivated by consumer preferences that cannot be met by domestic production. I'm pleased that as part of our inquiry we'll explore strengthening and safeguarding food security in Australia. The committee will enquire and report on the national production, consumption and export of food, as well as considering access to key inputs such as fuel, fertiliser and labour and their impact on production costs. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Additionally, the committee will explore the impact of supply-chain distribution on the cost and availability of food and the potential opportunities and threats of climate change for food production in Australia. We can see by recent floods that it can have a very devastating effect indeed on food production. We understand that food security is a growing issue nationally and internationally, with population growth, war, weather and climate all posing risks to the availability and accessibility of food. Australia has a role to play globally for food production as well. We do have a responsibility to help the globe feed itself as well as our own country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our inquiry is taking submissions until 9 December this year and wants to hear from as many stakeholders as possible to ensure a broad contribution from the agricultural and food sectors. I'm very proud to be a product of the regions, and I welcome the Albanese Labor government's commitment to working with industry to explore opportunities to improve price and market transparency and ensure a fair marketplace to enhance the productivity, profitability and sustainability of the agricultural sector.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As suggested, government has provided approximately $4 million to the dairy, seafood, red meat, horticulture, wine and chicken meat industries to improve price and market transparency. These projects are critical to supporting supply chains and allocating resources more effectively and will ensure that we adapt production in a timely manner and implement appropriate risk management strategies.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to acknowledge and commend Minister Murray Watt on his work since taking carriage of this important portfolio. One of our government's key achievements has been in progressing legislative amendments to strengthen protections for consumers and small businesses, including primary producers, by making unfair contract terms illegal. The legislation also provides a larger number of small businesses with protections due to changes in the eligibility thresholds. It would be a matter for the Treasurer to determine whether to consider legislation into a divestiture regime under the Competition and Consumer Act to apply to the food and grocery industry. We understand that there are risks associated with divestiture which would need to be examined to ensure any action would not undermine the viability of the retail sector, as this would have flow-on effects on agricultural industries and primary producers. Ours is a government that is committed to working with this sector on the challenges it faces and on all the problems that have been ignored for the past decade by those opposite. I look forward to continuing to work with industry and Minister Watt to progress meaningful reforms and investments for this incredibly important sector to Australia.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="265980" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms SHARKIE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mayo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:19</span>):  The agriculture sector is a significant contributor to the national economy. In 2020-21 the gross value topped $70 billion, increasing by seven per cent in the last 20 years in real terms adjusted for consumer price inflation. This equates to a long-term GDP contribution of between three and four per cent. In 2019, ACIL Allen consulting prepared an agricultural road map for the sector to achieve a farmgate value of $100 billion by 2030. Yet, despite the enormous economic and employment contributions by the sector to our nation, we do very little to protect it or nurture it compared to the other 37 member countries of the OECD. Australia's support for the agricultural sector, as a share of gross farm receipts, is a mere 2.5 per cent, compared to 15.1 per cent, which is the average for the OECD nations. This low level of support was driven by Australia's National Competition Policy and procompetitive reforms to meet our obligations to the WTO.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our agriculture sector does not ask for handouts, but it does rightly ask for a level playing field. While we have limited ability to influence our OECD neighbours regarding their agricultural support, we can and must influence our domestic arrangements, which in many instances are unfair. Australia's food and grocery sector is a duopoly, as the member for Kennedy said. Just two major supermarket chains cover about 75 per cent of the market. Suppliers have to be on the shelves of both the major chains in order to operate at scale. The majors know this, and they deliberately squeeze the best deal. Farmers are price takers; they are not price makers. Suppliers are at the mercy of retailers, and each year billions of dollars worth of fruit and vegetables are sent to landfill because the retail sector deems them too ugly for sale, even though they're all good food. They may just have a mark on them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are so many examples where producers can't even afford to pick their produce because the cost is so great. While we're talking about labour costs, I note that we've just signed a UK-Australia trade deal that's taken backpackers off our farms, and we're potentially going to do that again with the EU. This is a nightmare for regional Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The adage, 'With great power comes great responsibility,' is certainly appropriate for our supermarket segment. The market power of the major chains is so pronounced and influential that, in the absence of reasonableness, government intervention should be considered. I'd just like to draw to the attention of other members a very good book—it's a few years old now but still is relevant today—called <span style="font-style:italic;">Superma</span><span style="font-style:italic;">rket Monsters</span>. It talks about that duopoly and gives many examples. If you have the time over Christmas, have a read of it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've also got to say that it doesn't help when our city-centric living has divorced us from connection with the land and those who work on it. We have children in our community—in fact, we have adults in our community—who struggle to identify where milk comes from this. For clarity, it's not a carton from Woolworths. I support the member for Kennedy's motion to improve transparency on food and manufacturing labelling to eradicate hidden imports and to introduce fresh produce labelling that provides consumers with a better understanding of the actual gate price. Can I say to every member in here and, in fact, anyone who's listening to this on the radio or perhaps taking the time to read <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span>: put the effort in. If you can, buy from the farm gate or from farmers markets. I'm really fortunate. I live in regional Australia. I can pretty much do all of my food shopping within a few country roads from me. But can I say: when you see a farmer out and about, thank the farmer. I am deeply worried that in a generation's time, we will not have local dairy farms anymore; we'll just have agribusiness. We won't have mum-and-dad farmers. We need to do more in this nation to support agriculture, particularly mum-and-dad farming. I thank the member for Kennedy for this motion.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hunter</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:23</span>):  I thank the member for Kennedy for bringing forward this private member's business on this very important issue in my electorate. I must point out the first sentence in this motion, where it says:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">(1) calls on the Government to provide for agricultural security in Australia particularly given recent dramatic increases in the cost of production as a result of dislocations in imports and Australia continuing to be a net importer of fruit and vegetables …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is not factually correct. We are a net exporter of fruit and veg. But I digress.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In response to the current threats, the Albanese government has deployed the strongest ever response to a biosecurity threat to our border. We've supported our Indo-Pacific neighbours, toughened our legislation, stress-tested our preparedness and aligned ourselves carefully with state and territory partners in the nation's first National Biosecurity Strategy. It's worth repeating that Australia remains both foot-and-mouth-disease free and lumpy skin disease free.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The last few months have illustrated the need for a biosecurity system which is up to the contemporary challenges we face today. To that end, I'm pleased to say that Senator Murray Watt, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, has made the centrepiece of our agriculture budget an investment of $134.1 million to bolster Australian biosecurity systems against the immediate threat of disease. This includes more money for frontline biosecurity officers and more money for detector dogs that will help with getting the cargo moving whilst protecting Australia's biosecurity. But there's always more to do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate in the Hunter Valley, we have a very diverse agriculture sector, from viticulture, fruit and veg to dairy and, of course, the meat industry. Every day that I'm out speaking with our farmers and growers, the common theme I hear is the lack of workers. The Albanese Labor government is committed to working with and supporting our agriculture sector to access the workers it needs. To tackle those workforce challenges, this government is undertaking a range of measures in collaboration with state and territory governments and with industry and unions. The three-way Agricultural Workforce Working Group, comprising government, unions and industry members, has been established to pursue solutions to better skill, attract, protect and retain workers in the agriculture and processing sector.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government is also implementing a number of whole-of-economy measures to address workforce needs. These include increasing the permanent migration program ceiling to 195,000 in 2022-23, including 34,000 places specifically for regional visas within the skills stream. We are also providing an additional $42.2 million for Home Affairs to address the visa backlog, with more than two million visas already having been processed since June 2022. We are partnering with state and territory governments in delivering 465,000 new fee-free TAFE places, with 180,000 of those to be delivered next year. Our agriculture sector has been prioritised under this measure, meaning more Australians are supported to take up a career in agriculture. We are undertaking a comprehensive review of the purpose, structure and objectives of Australia's migration system to ensure it meets the challenges of the coming decade.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government also continues to implement a range of measures under the AgATTRACT and AgFAIR initiatives, which will support the sector to enhance and attract skilling and retention in the sector. This includes a structured employment pilot to offer young Australians the opportunity to try working in the agriculture sector as a gap year. In addition, the Australian government's Pacific Australia Labour Mobility, or PALM, scheme is a key program for meeting unskilled, low skilled and semiskilled workforce shortages in rural and regional Australia, including in the agriculture and meat-processing sectors. The scheme grew significantly during the pandemic, to 31,500 workers as of 31 October this year, which is a record number of PALM workers in Australia. Over 95 per cent of PALM workers in Australia are working in the agriculture and meat sectors. The government has committed to improving and expanding this scheme, with $67.5 million invested in the last budget.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said before, there is always more to do, and this government won't waste a single day in office. We are getting on with the job we were elected to do.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Firstly I would like to congratulate Karen Burdett and the team at the Cram Foundation, who celebrated 90 years last Friday night. The deputy chair of Cram, William Dowson OAM, was a wonderful MC, and we were delighted to hear from Pam Milone, who spoke about her daughter Kate's wonderful home at Cram, and also from Wollongong local Michael Theo from <span style="font-style:italic;">Love on the </span><span style="font-style:italic;">S</span><span style="font-style:italic;">pectrum</span>, who gave us some wonderful words of advice on the night. There were so many contributors across the Illawarra community who helped in making the Cram Foundation what it is today from very humble beginnings, in particular Ladies Auxiliary volunteer Martha Cram, who bequeathed her home to the organisation when she passed in 1965. I would also like to mention two other people very special to Cram: Cram's only life member and former chair, Patrick Roberts OAM, and also the current chair, Linda Wright, who gave us a snapshot of the times locally when Cram was established 90 years ago. Most of all, I would like to thank Cram's amazing team of staff, who carry the same passion and commitment to providing around-the-clock support to help participants live their very best lives.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know the power of the NDIS to help people living with a disability. I also know from firsthand experience the damage caused by nine years of neglect and mismanagement by the previous government. A scheme that was designed to build trust and give choice to people with a disability in their care has gradually been eroded. Throughout my career, I have advocated on behalf of so many people dealing with heartbreaking challenges and unfairness within the NDIS. These are just the cases who have contacted me, and I can't help but wonder how many people missed out on the support that they need because there was no one to advocate on their behalf. It isn't right. People living with disabilities should not have to fight a crippled system that is supposed to help them. But, finally, Australians living with a disability and their loved ones have a government that is getting the NDIS back on track. It was a Labor government that developed and introduced the NDIS, and it will be a Labor government that fixes it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a lot to fix. We are restoring the NDIS to put people with a disability at its centre. We have appointed Australian Paralympic champion and disability advocate Kurt Fearnley AO as the chairman of the board of the NDIA. There are now also five people on the NDIA board who have a disability—the highest number in its history. Our independent review into the NDIS will give a voice to people with a disability, their carers and families, disability care providers, and workers—voices that have been shut out for far too long, voices that we need to listen to.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are helping people with a disability who are trapped in hospitals despite being well enough to be discharged. Investing in people with a disability and removing barriers to employment is good for our economy and good for participants. We are providing $20 million through the Building Employer Confidence and Inclusion in Disability grants, which will help employers to hire and train people with a disability. We have reduced the backlog of appeals to the AAT—which were up 400 per cent under the previous government—from 4,500 to approximately 2,500 so far. We are funding 380 new positions in the NDIA to improve the rate at which people with disability and their families and carers are provided planning decisions. We are planning to increase the workforce needed to fill these vital care sector jobs. This began with the NDIS Jobs and Skills Forum in August. The forum brought together NDIS participants, their families, employers and unions to discuss the needs and concerns in the sector. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is no secret that the former government left the NDIA in a terrible state and that the NDIS was not delivering for Australians. My own office has been inundated with local cases of people waiting for months to get their programs fixed due to funding cuts that they've had over the past couple of years. We need to fix it, and we need to do it urgently. That is why, with this motion, I am calling on all members of the House to support the work that we have ahead of us. We can make the NDIS the world-leading scheme it was designed to be, and we can restore hope and dignity to people living with a disability in our communities and help them to live their best lives.</span>

                  <a href="297660" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr RYAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kooyong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:34</span>):  The National Disability Insurance Scheme has now been active since 1 July 2016. The NDIS was established to provide people with a disability with the support that they need to live an ordinary life. It's the only national scheme of its kind in the world. At its introduction, the NDIS was touted as having the potential to effect the same sort of generational shift as Medicare had achieved in the 1970s. Unlike previous such systems, the NDIS was designed to provide people with a disability with choice and control over how, when and where their services and support are delivered to them. They should be in control of this process. They should be able to choose what works best for them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In recent times this vision has been lost. In the last few years hundreds of consumers with autism, intellectual and psychosocial disabilities have lost their funding after the NDIA ruled that it wasn't value for money. Services have been stopped. Parents and carers have had to quit their jobs to look after their loved ones. As a member of the parliamentary Joint Standing Committee on the NDIS I've had the honour of hearing from providers and participants in recent weeks in a series of hearings in major cities in Australia. Some of those testimonials were really difficult to hear. They were raw, they were confronting and they were heartbreaking.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The NDIS system has the potential to be world leading but it has become adversarial. Participants are expected to justify why their static or progressive medical condition is not improving. They have been forced to undergo annual assessments which engender uncertainty and anxiety, when there's often no good reason for these serial assessments. They're having to take on review processes and the AAT without support or representation. We are forcing disabled Australians, their parents, their partners and their carers to battle a system in which transparency and generosity have been sacrificed to red tape and mean-spirited bureaucracy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we need from our NDIS is effective coordination and collaboration to make sure that people don't fall through the gaps between the NDIS and other services like health, justice, housing and transport. We need to focus on making the NDIS work for people with different needs, including culturally safe services, better regional access, expert planning, timely reviews and skilled support coordination. We need a service safety net which prevents serious harm when the NDIS market fails or when people need urgent access to NDIS supports. We need to put people first.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Next year I will be moving a private members bill to expedite placement of hospitalised NDIS participants into supported accommodation to get people who have been waiting months or years in hospital into housing which meets their needs and also frees up valuable hospital beds. It'll be a good thing, but it's just the start of what we need. We also need better services in rural, regional and remote areas. We need culturally accessible services for Aboriginal and Torres State Islander peoples and for people from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds. We need integration and coordination with mainstream support services. And we need more client engagement and transparency in the assessment and review processes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2008 Australia became a signatory to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. The first principle of this convention is to promote, protect and ensure the full and equal enjoyment of all human rights and fundamental freedoms for all people with disabilities and to promote respect for their inherent dignity. In recent years, this country has reverted to forcing people with handicaps to come cap in hand to our government for support. We owe them more than that. We owe them their dignity and our NDIS must deliver it.</span>

                  <a href="181810" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms TEMPLEMAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macquarie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:38</span>):  I thank the member for Cunningham for moving this motion. It is something that so many of us deal with on a day-to-day basis in our offices, working hard to support people for whom the NDIS is still not the perfect system, although we all acknowledge what a difference it makes to people when it works well. It's been a priority for the Albanese government, in the last six months, to really try and get to the bottom of what the barriers have been in the NDIS that have made it one of the biggest challenges that my office has experienced in the six years I've been in parliament. There are many things we have done. One of them is install new leadership. Really, it is not just the leaders but what you task them to do—that is, to put people at the heart of the system. People with disability are reason that we are here, and the systems are designed to work around them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another key priority has been around reducing the number of people with disability who are essentially trapped in hospitals. They are medically fit but have been unable to get out of hospital. For example, there were 1,400 people with a disability stuck in hospitals in August instead of being discharged once they were fit. We all know that that time in hospital results in care being delivered in completely the wrong setting at a higher cost, and it blocks other people from being able to use those beds. It costs the health system hundreds of millions of dollars each year and that is just the Commonwealth cost, let alone what the states pay.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The NDIA has been implementing our initial plan with some early successes. In October the NDIS minister announced that 50 hospital liaison officers nationally are now working with states and territories to, as he describes it, wrangle support and accommodation teams so that things are moving. In addition, there are 54 dedicated specialist hospital discharge planners and they have greater powers to be able to get things done at a local level. The consequence of this is we have reduced the average wait time for an NDIS participant to leave hospital from 160 days to just 39. There are also more than 300 people not on that list that we had in August, that 1,400 kind of stuck-there list. So we are getting better outcomes for patients. That is one area we have focused on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another area is the backlog of cases before the AAT. It is horrific how people have had to go through massive legal hoops just to get a package they deserve. The AAT work has also made a difference to the backlog. Under the previous government there had been a 400 per cent increase in the number of cases being referred to the AAT, leaving a legacy of 4,500 cases in the backlog, people who were waiting for their day in court. We commenced an independent expert review process to address the poor experience of the NDIS participants who had a dispute and we are getting on top of that backlog. Over 2,000 inherited legacy cases have now been resolved. That will be 2,000 families whose lives will be a whole lot better. We have also funded 380 new positions in the NDIA to get better and faster planning decisions for people with a disability, which supports their families, their carers, their providers and all the workers. So there are a number of things we have done but there is clearly more to do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our root-and-branch review will make a difference. I commend groups like the group I work with very closely, Kindship, who did a survey of their members to tell me all the things that were still needing to be done. We know there is still a long list of issues that have not been resolved in our first six months, things that have been plaguing the system for nearly a decade. I look forward to working through those issues with my constituents.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have a huge belief in the ability of the National Disability Insurance Scheme to transform people's lives, to allow older parents of people with a disability to sleep at night knowing that there is a plan in place for their child's future. There is so much we can do, and I know there is goodwill in this place to get it done and to support the workers who make this system a viable system.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr SUKKAR</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Deakin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:44</span>):  In rising to speak on this motion moved by the member for Cunningham, I think there are a few things worth highlighting. The first is that since the election we have seen a lot of rhetoric from the government and very little action. No doubt Australians will make judgements about the government in due course, and I think everyone will reasonably give the government time to implement some of the things that they have spoken about or, indeed, to address some of the issues that they have critiqued in opposition. The issue that many participants are having at the moment is the very significant change in rhetoric from the minister for the NDIS before the election to what the minister is saying now. Before the election, regrettably, in my view, the then shadow minister, now minister, sought to turn the NDIS into a partisan political issue in a way I hadn't seen any other parliamentarian do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Back in 2013, the coalition and Labor government of the day, in a bipartisan fashion, established the NDIS. It was really quite a coarse and toxic political environment that the now minister brought to this debate by turning it into a hyperpartisan issue. In that time, he simultaneously accused the coalition of cutting the NDIS to spending too much on the NDIS. So consistency certainly wasn't his strong suit in these arguments. But probably most significant for the participants in the NDIS, before the election, Minister Shorten, when he was shadow minister, said, 'There are no sustainability issues with the NDIS; there are none.' In essence, he ran around the building saying that anyone who talks about sustainability of funding for the NDIS and its cost curve is somehow trying to undermine the scheme. Before the election, when he was asked whether he thought the scheme was sustainable, he said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I don't buy that there's some catastrophic disaster happening to the NDIS.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Earlier in the year, he also said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">You can't move around the corridors of Parliament in Canberra without tripping over a Coalition Minister whispering the Scheme is unsustainable … I'm here to tell you today that is a lie.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Before the election, the minister, when he was trying to run a hyperpartisan and really regretful campaign that politicised the NDIS, he was saying that it's completely sustainable and anybody that says it is not trying to undermine it. Fast forward to the Labor government and their most recent budget, we now see the rhetoric drastically change. The minister is now saying that there are sustainability issues with the cost of the NDIS, and it's something that will need to form part of the government's thinking and, indeed, their review. Why is that such a significant breach of faith? In my view, the minister went to the election knowing he was sending a very strong message to those 500,000 NDIS participants and their families that he could, in some magical way, address all the problems and wave his magic wand to address all the problems in the NDIS. I suspect lots of people supported the government based on those promises. Now we see a completely different view.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The question for the government has to be: do they believe it's sustainable or not? If it's sustainable, as they said before the election, let's see how they plan to fund the expected growth in the scheme in a way that doesn't drastically change it. If they are now trying to use the review as some way to break that promise before the election, the minister should have the decency to fess up now because I can tell you that there are many NDIS participants and their families who are very nervous because the rhetoric has changed so drastically from before to after the election.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is ironic coming from me as a shadow minister, but the minister still does sound like a shadow minister. He's running around critiquing all the problems with the NDIS, commissioning a review—a significant review in one case—without actually offering any solutions. Nothing's changed. The queues and the time that it takes to get into SDA accommodation have not changed. The minister's happy to talk about it to the enth degree, but he has been the minister for six months. Hurry up. Make sure the action meets the rhetoric.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="282212" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms THWAITES</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Jagajaga</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:49</span>):  I want to thank the member for Cunningham for moving this motion. Like her and like so many of my colleagues, the NDIS is a critical issue for me and for members of my community. I know that, in terms of representations to my office in Jagajaga, this would be one of the top five issues that people bring to me—the challenges they are having with the NDIS, looking for my support for their interactions with the NDIA, and understanding interventions in outcomes that they just don't understand. This tells us something which I think we all know—that the NDIS, while a great scheme, is not working as it should for some participants.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many people do have excellent experiences as part of the NDIS. I'm so pleased when I come across a parent who tells me that the NDIS has literally been life changing for their children. There are a lot of those parents, and that is something to absolutely be acknowledged and celebrated. The NDIS is a great Labor reform. It is a great Labor legacy, and now, it seems, it is up to a new Labor government to make sure that we fix the NDIS and that it is working as it should for all participants.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We do want to ensure that those people who had experiences that they just shouldn't have had, during the last nine years of the coalition government, don't have those experiences into the future. I don't want it to be a continuing situation that I have parents coming into my office, saying: 'I just don't understand how this decision was made. I can't get them to explain. What's behind this? Why are we at the AAT? Why are lawyers involved?' This isn't how the scheme was meant to operate. It is meant to give people with disability choice and control. At the moment, for some people, that is absolutely working, but it's not working for enough people. Our government wants to restore trust in the scheme. We want to see improved outcomes for participants and for the people who support them, and I absolutely know that my community wants to see this too.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the beginning of this year, I wrote to households across my community about the NDIS because I had been hearing from so many people about problems they had encountered. I asked them to share their stories and their experiences so I could better advocate on their behalf. Across the feedback I received was a clear indication that our community wants the NDIS to be at its best. People saw the potential that's there for the NDIS to be as good as it can be, delivering supports and services to people in our community who need them. I continue to highlight that local desire, as well as the local experiences of NDIS participants and their families, with our minister. I am pleased to see that in the first six months of our government there are some very important steps that have been taken by our government to get the NDIS back on track.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not a small thing to say this includes the new leadership at the National Disability Insurance Agency, the NDIA. This is an important step. We know that those at the top of an organisation, any organisation, help set the standard. They're not the only people there, but they are important people there, and they do help to set the tone, set the standard and reinforce values. In the last couple of months, Kurt Fearnley has been appointed chairperson of the NDIA board, and he is joined by new board members Dr Graeme Innes and Maryanne Diamond. What these appointments bring is lived experience, which is so crucial to the scheme. They bring corporate and public sector experience and a great understanding and knowledge of the issues being experienced by so many people on the scheme. There is also a new CEO to help show to participants that this is a new chapter for the NDIA under our government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has also sought to address some of the challenges that advocates have been highlighting with me and others as key issues. We are working to reduce the backlog of time-consuming, expensive AAT appeals that I know have caused so much stress and anxiety for too many people. In just five months, 2,000 inherited legacy cases have been resolved, slashing the backlog in half. This is really important. Again, I can't tell you how many families I've had come to me stressed about ending up at the tribunal. Our government is also reducing the number of people with disability unnecessarily stuck in hospitals despite being medically fit for discharge. We've reduced this to about 1,100 people and reduced the average wait time. We are funding 380 new positions in the NDIA to deliver better and faster planning decisions for participants, as well as their families, carers and providers, to give them that certainty so that they know what their pathway is, so that they understand what to expect and so that, in what can be a really stressful time, people feel supported—not like they are being told what they can't have, but like they are being supported with rules they can understand. These are all important changes.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms DANIEL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Goldstein</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:54</span>):  Julia Gillard is rightly applauded for being the Prime Minister who established the NDIS. Indeed, she has declared it the achievement of which she is most proud—so too the government services minister, who deserves praise for his advocacy for the scheme as a member of that government and for standing up for the rights of people with disabilities when the previous government was doing its best to limit access to the scheme, tying up the disabled and their families in knots as they struggled to get the assistance to which they were entitled. These were issues which were raised with me repeatedly before the election, and that remains the case to this day. Constituents report the nightmares caused by care packages being changed, often without explanation, and then being caught up in lengthy battles in the AAT. The fact is that this retraumatises a highly vulnerable group of citizens, their families and their carers, and, if they're not traumatised, they're exasperated at the complexity and opacity of a system they were led to believe was there to help.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In December we're holding a forum on the NDIS in Goldstein, which is already almost sold out. Here are just a handful of examples from my community that have come to my attention. A constituent in her late 80s whose son has a disability has had changes made to his support package at short notice, with money running out in half the time it usually would. The constituent fears she will have to pay for his care now, at $10,000 a week.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another constituent has had her disabled brother's hearing aid support stopped. Without the hearing aids, his hearing will be lost altogether. As her brother has an intellectual disability, he can only tolerate a fixed style hearing aid that he cannot feel or remove. Without hearing, her brother's already limited access to the world around him diminishes to almost nothing, seriously affecting his mood and how he relates to carers and others.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another constituent has two girls, both born with severe disabilities. She and her husband are having difficulty coping, as they're trying to work as well as support their five- and three-year-old daughters. They aren't seeking anything more than the minimum day, and all of the experts they've spoken to think it's reasonable and necessary.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, the NDIA responses have been slow and complicated. Constituent experiences with local area support workers are highly variable and inconsistent, and having to revalidate cases every year or two is a full-time job for many families as they try to navigate the administrative tangle that is the NDIS.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was disturbed to read in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Saturday Paper</span> on the weekend that some of the departmental architects of robodebt are now in the bowels of the National Disability Insurance Agency. According to documents obtained by Rick Morton, they have or had been working out ways to outlaw the use of NDIS funds for what look on the face of it to be entirely reasonable purposes. For example, one note attached to a working document declares:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The drafting of the rules of what is an 'ordinary living expense' or 'goods and services specified in the rules' should provide us with a basis for making determinations of non-compliance and remove some of the questions of what is allowable / not allowable with the removal of the term 'reasonable and necessary'.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The minister told Radio National a fortnight ago that there'd been a lack of attention on the payment side, but he was clear that it was some service providers who were 'taking the scheme for a lend', as he put it. He added that there was 'rent-seeking behaviour by some providers' and 'there are rorts out there'. That is where the focus for the future must be—not on making it unnecessarily difficult and traumatising for people with disabilities and their families but on rooting out the rorts.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It gives me great pleasure to rise in the chamber today after meeting, out on the parliament lawn, with Iranian Australians and many from the Baha'i faith to speak about what's going on in Iran but also to defend the right of those of the Baha'i faith to practise their religion without being persecuted. Earlier this year, in my office, I met with Sepehr Abedian and Houta Sabet, two members of the Gold Coast Baha'i Community, and we spoke about their concerns regarding the treatment of their friends and family in Iran. Baha'is are the largest non-Muslim religious minority in Iran, and for decades they have been routinely persecuted, arrested, detained and imprisoned. More recently, international media has reported that homes were raided, confiscated or bulldozed and members of the Baha'i community were arrested in various cities throughout Iran because of their faith. None of this is new. The Baha'i Faith community in Iran has been dealing with mistreatment and persecution for decades. Since 2005, more than 800 Iranian Baha'is have been arrested or detained due to their faith, and there have been more than 780 incidents of economic persecution documented. I heard one just the other night, of a Gold Coaster whose family had escaped on camelback. He won an export award at the Australian Export Awards the other night, in the Great Hall, and is very, very proud of his achievements in this country. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Baha'is are barred from holding government jobs, their businesses are routinely closed or discriminated against and young Baha'is are prevented from attending university because of their faith. Where they can, Baha'i elders hold underground universities, where they can learn and receive an education. The elders must be careful, as those caught educating young Baha'is can be, and have been, sentenced to five-year jail terms. This is the 21st century, and we are witnessing young people refused the opportunity to further their knowledge because of their religion. Many Bahai's have left Iran, as I mentioned before, to seek a better life elsewhere, including in my community on the Gold Coast. I want to share a story that Seppi—as we call him with great warmth—shared with me during our meeting about a young Baha'i who came to Australia recently. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After arriving in Australia, Sep took this young person on a tour of a nearby university campus where there was an option to study. As part of the tour, they visited the campus library. This Baha'i, new to our country, was so nervous about entering the library that she asked Sep if he was sure she was allowed to go inside. Could you imagine feeling like that—unsure whether you're welcome in a place where so many of us feel safe, such as a public or university library? It's heartbreaking to hear the story. To know that young people are banned from places of learning and banned from having educational opportunities is heartbreaking. Baha'is in Iran are subject to systemic violence and harassment with hundreds of incidents reported of torture, physical assault, disappearances, suspicious deaths, arson against homes and businesses, vandalism, cemetery desecration and the abuse of schoolchildren, which is fuelled by a continuous campaign to incite hatred against Baha'is in Iran. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Iran's human rights record has been a longstanding and serious concern for Australia. During our time in government, the coalition repeatedly raised our concerns with Iran in Canberra, Tehran and in multilateral forums. Australia is a co-sponsor of the annual UN General Assembly resolution on the human rights situation in Iran. We also co-sponsor the UN Human Rights Council resolution extending the mandate of the special rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Iran. In December last year, there was a UN General Assembly calling for an end to the harassment and discrimination against the Baha'i Faith. We are troubled by the high number of death sentences and continued executions in Iran, and the treatment of ethnic and religious minorities, women and girls, and the LGBTIQA community. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tangney</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:04</span>):  I want to take this opportunity to speak to a grave matter. I speak in this parliament as a Buddhist and as a person from a different country. I would like to acknowledge that, in Australia, I have the freedom to express my views. In Australia, we have the gifts and protections that democracy allows. These protections are not afforded to all around the world. Right now, horrific abuse is taking place in Iran. There is bloodshed, violence, death and fear. This is marked by the brutal killing of Jina Mahsa Amini, a 22-year-old woman, at the hands of the so-called morality police in Iran. The morality police said Jina was wearing her hijab too loosely. This is unconscionable. Jina's death is unconscionable.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This has led to protests. In Iran, people have taken to the streets. Women, in particular, have taken to the streets. These women are risking their lives to have their voices heard. These women are demonstrating, with their actions, that they would sooner face the risk of death than continue to face oppression. And people have faced death. Hundreds have lost their lives in the protests. For those who have been arrested, Iran's parliament recently voted in favour of the death penalty for all current protest prisoners.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Shockingly, the violence continues to grow, with members of the Baha'i faith subjected to appalling persecution. This violence is, tragically, nothing new. The Baha'i have been facing persecution from the Iranian government for 40 long years. There has been intensified repression of and discrimination against the Baha'i in Iran. This is deeply concerning. My heart breaks for and with the Baha'i people.</span>

It includes torture, arbitrary detention and other cruel, violent means. Enforced disappearances are not uncommon; nor is the forcible closure of businesses or confiscation of property. Houses are demolished, cemeteries are destroyed, and hate speech comes from officials and state media. Authorities have prevented Baha'is from burying their loved ones in empty plots in cemeteries, instead insisting that they use mass grave sites.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Baha'i are not a violent people. Importantly, the Baha'i faith calls for obedience to civil authorities and rejects any acts of violence or aggression. The Baha'i are a kind people. They are a just people. They believe in the equality of women and men. They believe in the harmony of religion and science. They believe in the elimination of all forms of prejudice and an equal standard of human rights for all people. I am fortunate to have made connections with members of the Baha'i faith during my time as a police officer. These warm relationships continue. I am very grateful for the friendship of the Baha'i community of Melville, including Dr Jimmy Seow and his peers. Their tireless work inspires me.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moore</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Second Deputy Speaker</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:09</span>):  On behalf of the Baha'i community in Australia, I'm happy to have seconded this private members' motion calling for an end to the systematic persecution of Baha'is in Iran. The Baha'i faith is considered the second-largest religion in Iran, after Islam. According to the United Nations there are an estimated 350,000 adherents of the Baha'i faith in Iran and an estimated five million followers worldwide.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The freedom to practise one's chosen religion is a fundamental right that forms the core of our democratic beliefs in Australia. Our society allows freedom of religion free from persecution, intimidation and harassment. It is our sincere hope that the international religious tolerance movement will spread like a light throughout the world. It is incumbent upon us as elected representatives in a free society to call upon foreign governments around the world, including countries such as Iran, to respect the freedom of religion and allow their citizens to worship peaceably with tolerance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In raising public awareness of this issue it is hoped that world attention will be focused on addressing this grave injustice. Baha'is have remained peaceful and active members of Iranian society. They pose no threat to the government. They are not aligned with any political ideology or opposition movement, nor do they engage in subversive activity or violence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Currently in Iran Baha'is are barred from holding government jobs and their shops and other enterprises are routinely closed by officials at all levels. The youth in the Baha'i community are also persecuted, prevented from attending university and, as volunteer educators, have been arrested and imprisoned. In 2022 alone there have been over 30 arrests on account of their faith in various cities throughout Iran. In August this year, authorities bulldozed six Baha'i houses and confiscated more than 20 hectares of land in the Mazandaran province in northern Iran. Earlier this month Iran stepped up its actions against the Baha'i community, arresting 12 citizens. This has been condemned by global rights groups.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In supporting this motion for an end to the systematic persecution of Baha'is by the government of Iran and, more broadly, an end to persecution of Baha'is by governments across the world, I urge all governments to consider the potential contributions that can be made to society by allowing Baha'is to freely practice their religion, free from persecution, intimidation and harassment. International monitoring constitutes a vital safeguard for the protection of the Baha'i community. Whenever this issue is publicised, discussed in parliaments or raised with Iranian officials, it sends a signal to the Iranian government that it is being held to account for its actions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian government has repeatedly raised concerns with Iran in Canberra, with Tehran and through multilateral forums. As a nation we are a co-sponsor of the annual United Nations General Assembly resolution on the human rights situation in Iran. In addition, Australia co-sponsors the Human Rights Council resolution, extending the mandate of the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Iran. In December last year there was a United Nations General Assembly resolution calling for an end to the harassment and discrimination of Baha'is in Iran.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a strong Baha'i community in Western Australia, in particular in the northern suburbs of Perth. I have been fortunate enough to meet many Baha'is living in my electorate and also in the surrounding suburbs. Through my association with the local Baha'i community over a number of years, I have observed its members to be very peaceful, tolerant and family oriented. The religion could hardly be described as fundamentalist or extremist in nature. Rather, it is very moderate. As I have become more familiar with individual members of the local spiritual assembly, what greatly impresses me generally about the Baha'i community is the ability of its members to integrate and assimilate into Australian society by fully and actively participating in the development and advancement of our nation through higher education and their professional careers in fields such as business, engineering, medicine and academia.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macnamara</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:14</span>):  I rise to speak on this important motion moved by the member for Moncrieff and I congratulate her for raising this matter. It is an important matter in this place. Support for the brave people of Iran and opposition to religious persecution is something that unites Australia and the Australian parliament. I have great admiration for the Baha'i people. Dr Vahid Master is a Baha'i leader in my electorate, an extraordinary doctor. He has welcomed me to his home on many occasions to celebrate the Baha'i community and faith. The things that strike me in my time with the Baha'i community locally is their sense of self-respect, dignity and peace as well as their deep appreciation and love for the Australian people and the Australian community more broadly. I also have stood on top of the Baha'i World Centre in Haifa and seen the most breathtaking gardens that really speak volumes to the self-respect and imagination of the Baha'i people.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yet for the last 40 years in Iran, the birthplace of the Baha'i faith, the Baha'i have not enjoyed the same freedom that they do here in Australia. Ever since the regime of the Ayatollahs came to power in 1979, the Baha'i have been persecuted for their beliefs. They been subject to arbitrary arrest, their businesses have been closed down, their homes and places of worship have been raided. They have been denied entry to university and they have been unable to travel. Even their cemeteries have been desecrated.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This year protests have surged across Iran demanding greater freedom, particularly for women. In the wake of the murder of Mahsa Amini by Iran's so-called morality police in September, the regime has responded by increasing its persecution of the Baha'i. Many Baha'i have been arrested, some were detained at their homes while others were rounded up with other protesters in the streets. Like many of the arrested demonstrate, these Baha'i have been locked up without specific charges and have not been allowed to meet with their families.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I recently spoke with representatives of the Baha'i community locally who told me of their great concern for their families and friends in Iran and I'm sure other members share with me those grave concerns. They also told me that they were very grateful for the support that the Australian government and people have expressed in giving Baha'i people and indeed all of the persecuted people their voice of solidarity against what is occurring in Iran.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thought I would take a moment to outline some of the things that have already occurred in response to the action of Iran. We have time and time again called for Iran to respect the human rights and cease the discrimination against religious and ethnic minorities. Australia's ambassador to Iran has raised our concerns in Tehran, and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade has raised concerns with the Iranian embassy in Canberra.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia has made it clear that Iran's treatment of women and the protesters is incompatible with their membership of the UN Commission on the Status of Women. The government has been engaging with the National Spiritual Assembly of the Bahá'ís of Australia and we will continue to advocate for the human rights of the Baha'i in Iran.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia as a member of the core drafting group for the UN General Assembly Third Committee resolution on the human rights situation in Iran did play an active role in shaping the language of the resolution, including regarding the Baha'i and other minorities. What we have here in Australia is a wonderful part of Australian society. We are proud of our Baha'i and we celebrate our Baha'i people here in Australia. I acknowledge those who have come to join and listen to this debate tonight. But I also know that, for them, a part of them is not complete without the Baha'i community feeling safe and free from the persecution that is occurring in Iran. So we stand with the Baha'i people in Australia and of course with the Baha'i in Iran. We raise our Australian voices to say that the persecution of the Baha'i people is unacceptable and that we hope for better days in the years to come. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mackellar</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:19</span>):  I'd also like to welcome those who are here this evening representing the Baha'i community. I'm honoured that my electorate of Mackellar is the proud home of Australia's Baha'i House of Worship, one of just 13 temples around the world and the only one on the Australasian continent. It is a symbol of unity and an icon of our electorate. It stands magnificently in the hinterland of our electorate, nestled amongst the beautiful bushland. It is a place of sanctuary, it is a place of worship and it is a place that is open and belongs to all Australians, where people of all different religions and backgrounds are welcome. This physical building is a reflection of the Baha'i faith and community—one that is committed to social cohesion and harmony and is warmly valued as part of our Mackellar community and as a contributor to Australia's broader community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Baha'i Community was established in 1920 and is now represented in over 350 localities and regions throughout our country. They are part of a worldwide community of people of Baha'i faith, an independent world religion with more than five million members. On Wednesday evening, the Baha'i community will hold their annual parliamentary reception to celebrate the birth of Baha'u'llah. This event is also a celebration of the constructive cohesion and resilience demonstrated by Australians across the country and indeed many across the globe. Some of the key principles of the Baha'i faith—such as gender equality, elimination of all forms of prejudice and human rights for all people—are values that are shared by the broader Mackellar and Australian community. In neighbourhoods across Mackellar and across the country, Baha'is are striving to build united and spiritually vibrant communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">However, as this motion highlights, this is not the experience of the Baha'is in Iran. Baha'i is Iran's largest non-Muslim religion, with around 300,000 Baha'is living in Iran. The Baha'is have a long history of persecution in Iran, especially since 1979 and the Iranian Revolution. Official news media has inflamed this persecution by inciting hatred, which has led to many violent attacks on Baha'is and their properties, including destruction of their cemeteries. Thousands of these attacks over many decades are documented on the website Archives of Baha'i Persecution in Iran, which is administered by the Baha'i International Community, an organisation which draws attention to human rights violations committed against Iranian Baha'is.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Baha'is are routinely arrested, detained and imprisoned in Iran. They are banned from holding government jobs, and their shops are routinely closed or discriminated against by officials at all levels of government. Young Baha'is are prevented from attending university, and volunteer Baha'i educators are often arrested and imprisoned when they attempt to fill the education gap. Since the nationwide protests started this September, there has been an escalation of violent attacks and human rights violations on Baha'is in Iran, including interrogations, beatings and detentions without due process. In her recent address to the UN Human Rights Council, Simin Fahandej, representative of the Baha'i International Community, articulated the deteriorating situation of human rights in Iran. She said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… the Baha'is in Iran are all too familiar with persecution, with suffering, arbitrary imprisonment, denial of higher education, hate propaganda, executions and daily harassment for 43 years. In fact, what we see in Iran today is the extension of the persecution against the Baha'is to the generality of Iranians. A government that oppresses one group will surely be unjust to all groups in the long term.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I support the member for Moncrieff's motion that condemns the actions of the Iranian government's persecution of those of the Baha'i faith. Cohesion and resilience are core values of strong communities, and I wholeheartedly support not only the Baha'i community in my electorate of Mackellar but the Baha'i community globally as they face the horrific persecution from the Iranian government. I just want you to know that, here in Australia and here in the parliament as well, we do support you. Thank you for being here tonight.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="300126" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr REID</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Robertson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:24</span>):  I start by welcoming all of you in the gallery of the Federation Chamber today. Thank you so much for coming and listening to us here today, and welcome to the people's house. I'll also start by thanking and congratulating the member for Moncrieff for raising this critical issue with the House, with the Chamber, with the members present here today and with the broader community. It is such an important and critical issue not just here in Australia but right across the world. We've seen that around the world people have been and continue to be persecuted because of their faith. We have seen communities subjugated. We have seen communities destroyed or oppressed and their belongings and property destroyed. They have been denied access to services, jailed or even worse.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Everybody on this planet deserves the right to be who they want to be. Everybody deserves the right, if they choose, to practise their faith without persecution or repercussion, and I'm a strong advocate for this, as are many of the members here in the Chamber tonight. I will continue be a supporter and a voice for those who are silenced because of their faith or their way of life. Faith is important to many because it provides people with a sense of self, a sense of community and a sense of direction. Faith can unify us, and it can be the guiding light for some during the darkest of times.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A few weeks ago, a gentleman named Vedad visited the Robertson electoral office. He's an elected member of the Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of the Central Coast. I'm grateful to Vedad for visiting me that day—he has given me permission to use his name—as he was kind enough to provide insight into the Baha'i faith and the Baha'i community on the Central Coast in New South Wales, across Australia and, indeed, around the world. He was describing the Baha'i community, and I'd use the same words that the member for Moncrieff, the member for Macnamara and many members here tonight have used: peaceful, welcoming, educated. They are a beautiful people and a beautiful community. He spoke of the children's spiritual education classes in Gosford and the regular devotional meetings where the Baha'i community on the Central Coast would come together as one.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Vedad also highlighted the difficulties and persecution that the Baha'i community are facing in Iran. As has been noted previously, the government is deeply concerned by reports that, since 2 August 2022, repression and discrimination against the Baha'i people in Iran have increased and intensified. Australia has called and will continue to call on Iran to respect human rights and to cease the discrimination against religious and ethnic minorities. The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is engaging with the National Spiritual Assembly of the Baha'is of Australia and will continue to advocate for the human rights of the Baha'i in Iran. Australia's ambassador to Iran raised our concerns to Tehran on 14 June 2022, and most recently the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade raised our concerns with the Iranian embassy in Canberra on 13 October 2022. Australia, as a member of the core drafting group for the UN General Assembly Third Committee resolution on the human rights situation in Iran, played an active role in shaping the language of the resolution, including regarding the Baha'i and other minorities. The resolution was adopted with 79 yes votes and only 28 no votes—a better result than in 2021.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Again I wish to thank the member for Moncrieff for raising this important issue. As I said earlier, Australia will continue to call on Iran to respect human rights and cease the discrimination against minorities. We stand with the Baha'i people and the community both here in Australia and in Iran.</span>
