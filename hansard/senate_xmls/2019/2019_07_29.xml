                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="144292" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator PATRICK</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:01</span>):  I think most people would be quite surprised to learn that ministers of state do not require a security clearance, that ministers of state get access to the most sensitive of government information, including having access to cabinet information, yet there is no security check. So I'm pleased to have this opportunity to add to the observations I made in my second reading speech when I first introduced the Ministers of State (Checks for Security Purposes) Bill 2019.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On 4 July, the Senate referred the bill to the Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee for inquiry and report, due by 11 November. That committee will, one hopes, conduct a thorough and long overdue examination of the important issue this bill seeks to address, which is security at the highest levels of government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The exemption of ministers from any mandatory security-checking process is a dangerous anomaly and a significant gap in Australia's protective security framework. The bill establishes a framework for ministers to undergo a security-checking process by ASIO that is equivalent to and as rigorous as that imposed on all other persons with access to our nation's most sensitive and highly classified secrets. The purpose would be to provide security advice to the Prime Minister.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the event that the security background check reveals an area of security concern, the Prime Minister would be free to determine what steps might be required to resolve the matter. The PM is, and would remain, the absolute decision-maker with regard to who is recommended to the Governor-General to serve in a ministerial office and have access to our nation's innermost decision-making and most sensitive secrets. What this bill will do is ensure that the PM is fully advised of any security issues that may arise from a comprehensive background checkâsomething that is not mandatory now. To be very clear, this security check could not be used for any purpose other than to inform the Prime Minister, and only the Prime Minister, of the dayâand it's so framed in the bill. If the Prime Minister changes, the new Prime Minister cannot have access to previous assessments, only to assessments on ministers who are members of their cabinet.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The necessity for improving security across the board was again highlighted last week by the outgoing Director-General of Security, Duncan Lewis, who, in an interview with <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian </span>newspaper, warned in blunt terms that Australia faces an 'unprecedented' wave of espionage and foreign interference. Mr Lewis warned that 'the espionage threat showed no sign of abating', while 'unwelcome influence within Australia's political system is now widespread'. He said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is an unprecedented level of activity â¦ it's not visible to most people. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government and the parliament have already responded to these national security challenges, notably with the introduction of new laws to deal with foreign espionage and covert political interference and with the establishment of a foreign influence transparency scheme, which is administered by the Attorney-General. This bill supports the objective of the recent legislation by providing the Australian public with greater assurance that security will be maintained at the highest levels of the Australian government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Regrettably, it cannot be assumed that persons appointed to high political office will always be free of characteristics, activities, associations, connections or obligations that may compromise or risk the compromise of national security within the executive government. Human frailty being what it is, elected parliamentarians and ministers are not immune to weaknesses and temptations that in rare but significant cases may lead to involvement in espionage and, indeed, treason. At the end of the Cold War, the publication of secret Soviet intelligence files showed that the KGB had enjoyed success in recruiting as agents not just Western government officials but also parliamentarians and ministers in a number of Western countries. In the United Kingdom, for example, at least two former British Labour MPs were identified as agents recruited by the KGB. Two other Labour MPs, including one minister in the Harold Wilson government, have also been confirmed as having been paid agents of the communist Czechoslovakian intelligence service, the StB. Here in Australia, the publication of KGB archives, as well as the release of ASIO files by the National Archives, revealed that a former federal member for Hunter, the late Bert James, was a covert source for the Soviet embassy. Another Labor MP, the late senator John Wheeldon, was involved in a sex espionage scandal involving the chief KGB officer in Canberra and a French embassy official. Wheeldon was later a minister in the Whitlam government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Cold War is long over, but, if anything, the counterespionage and challenges that Australia now faces a much greater than ever before. China, the rising regional power, already enjoys considerable access to and influence within the Australian political system, from local governments to state parliaments and here, the national parliament. Security issues involving elected MPs and ministers have always been politically sensitive, and there has long been a reluctance to require ministers who are elected representatives to undergo any security-checking processes. I might point out that there are some suggested constitutional concerns because of the separation of powers, but we must remember that members of parliament and senators, who are in a separate pillar in respect of our government, are occasionally ministers, and it is when they are ministers that they fill a role in the executive, so there is no constitutional impediment to this bill proceeding. We don't have security clearances. In the current security environment, this can no longer be acceptable. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Recent experience concerning the noncompliance of MPs and senators with constitutional requirements for election to parliament shows that the party preselection processes and electoral and media scrutiny, as well as selection to serve on the ministry, cannot be relied on to identify matters that would be an issue in a security-background checking process. Instances of corruption or other embarrassing incidents involving Australian political figures show that ministers may succumb to temptations that may make them vulnerable to compromise. Over the past decades, specific security issues have arisen in relation to ministers and shadow ministers. One case which I have previously discussed in the Senate, in an adjournment speech, is the relationship between member for Hunter and former defence minister Joel Fitzgibbon and Chinese Australian property developer Helen Liu, a person who is directly linked to senior Chinese military intelligence operatives. Senators would also be familiar with matters that lead to the resignation of former senator Sam Dastyari. He was a very buoyant chap, and I'm sure he would have gone on to become a Labor minister. I make no judgement about the member for Hunter, or, indeed, former Senator Dastyari. Suffice to say, these matters are precisely the sorts of issues that would be appropriately addressed by a security-checking regime. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I pointed out in my second reading speech, Canada has taken up the practice of security checking its federal ministers. That process has been adopted by successive Canadian governments and also extends to security checking MPs who serve on Canada's National Security and Intelligence Committee of Parliamentarians, the equivalent of our Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security. Once again, we now see in legislation, slowly creeping in as we introduce more powers, the ability of the PJCIS to examine some elements of what it is that our security services do. Yet, none of the members who are on that committee are required to have a security check of any sort. So an additional issue which the Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee might wish to consider is the question of security checks for members of the PJCIS. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is designed to be fully consistent with the Prime Minister's responsibilities in selecting and leading the cabinet and ministry. It would be naive to think that Australian ministers of state will always be immune from failings that may make them vulnerable to compromise or tempt them into behaviour that may harm national security. They should be subject to security checking equivalent to what is done by or that applies to many thousands of public servants and Defence Force personnel who have access to highly classified information. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm not suggesting, and the bill does not suggest, that the security services have any vetting role over a ministerâto be very, very clear about that. The bill requires that a report be compiled for the Prime Minister and only for the Prime Minister, and what the Prime Minister does to deal with any concerns that may be raised in the report it is at the discretion of the Prime Minister. When he has finished with that report, it returns to the Director-General of Security, where it will be locked away, and the bill explicitly states that report can be used for no other purpose. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I might just reflect on last week when we were discussing the TEO bill, the temporary exclusion order bill. A process has been enacted in law nowâunfortunately, in my view, on account of the lack of protections for flawed evidence. In that particular bill, the home affairs minister makes a determination based upon advice from ASIOâpresumably classified advice. He or she then passes their decision to a review authority who is security cleared to conduct a quick review. But the bill allows for the minister not to pass on the ASIO assessment if it's not in the public interest to do so. The ironyâthe dichotomyâof that particular arrangement is that the review authority is required to be security cleared, but the minister who makes the decision, who sees the most sensitive information, is not required to be cleared. That creates an anomaly. I'm not suggesting anything in relation to our current home affairs minister; I'm just using that as an example that most people would say is odd. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the very start I suggested that most Australians would be unaware and would think it very odd that our ministers who access briefings from all of our intelligence services, see sensitive information from foreign governments, get access to sensitive information from companies and generate their own sensitive information are not security cleared. This bill will plug a major gap in Australia's protective security framework, and I commend it to the Senate. </span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator PATERSON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:14</span>):  I rise also to speak on the Ministers of State (Checks for Security Purposes) Bill 2019. As the Chair of the Senate Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee, I look forward to our forthcoming inquiries into this bill and no doubt considering the evidence and submissions we receive. Although Senator Patrick's well-known interest in and concern for national security is laudable, the government does not support this bill. I will briefly outline why this morning.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government already has extensive vetting processes in place for ministerial staff and public servants which Senator Patrick proposes be effectively extended to also include ministers. Senator Patrick's bill would require the Prime Minister, within 14 days of the appointment of a minister, to direct the director-general of ASIO to investigate and provide a report on matters relating to security, including the personal background and circumstances of a minister. The director-general must then provide the report to the Prime Minister within 120 days, and it must be returned to ASIO upon the Prime Minister ceasing to hold that office.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The existing process for ministerial staff and public servants is comprehensive and appropriate. Depending on the level of clearance required, it can involve identity and citizenship verification, a police check, statutory declarations, referee checks, a digital footprint check, a financial history check, an ASIO assessment, a security interview and a psychological assessment. However, there are very good reasons why ministers and their staff and public servants should be treated differently when it comes to security vetting. In the Westminster system, the only qualifications for ministerial office are, first, election by the people as a member of parliament and, second, an invitation from the Prime Minister to join their ministry. Along with every other member of parliament, ministers are required to publicly declare any relevant interest that they may have which could influence them in the exercise of their duties. Ministers are also accountable to the parliament and have to front up on a regular basis to question time, estimates and other forums to be questioned on their conduct and performance in their role. Introducing a third qualification, whereby ministers would be required, in effect, to pass a bureaucratic process in order to hold office, undermines the Westminster system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is entirely appropriate for ministerial staff and public servants to undergo security vetting because they are entering into an employment relationship. But ministers are not employees; they are public officials. With that status comes the public scrutiny and accountability that cannot and should not be equally applied to staff or public servants. Public servants and ministerial staff do not stand for election and, therefore, do not expose themselves to the public and media scrutiny that comes with that. The burden for ensuring that ministers are qualified and appropriate for their role rightly falls squarely with the Prime Minister. Any Prime Minister knows that their appointments will be scrutinised through the democratic parliamentary and political processes that we have in place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course, party leaders must exercise good judgement in choosing their frontbench teams, and I acknowledge, as Senator Patrick has pointed out, that has not always been the case. Senator Patrick raises the case of Senator Dastyari, and I was also planning to raise it in my remarks because I think it is a salutary lesson, although for different reasons than Senator Patrick does. I think it is, in the last parliament at least, the most infamous example of an inclusion of an inappropriate person in, in this case, an opposition shadow ministry. Yet, even in this instance, the best protection that our political system has against an unsuitable appointment remains public scrutiny. After adverse media coverage and parliamentary scrutiny, Senator Dastyari first stepped down from the Labor front bench in September 2016, then again stepped down from the Labor front bench in November 2017 following further revelations, and ultimately resigned from the Senate entirely in December 2017. This is a good example of how the public and parliamentary scrutiny processes that we already have in place are the best and most effective mechanism for ensuring that an unsuitable person is not appointed, in this instance, to a shadow ministry; it would equally apply had the Labor Party been successful at the last election and won government and had Senator Dastyari aspired to serve in the ministry in government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A confidential security vetting process as proposed by Senator Patrick is no substitute for this robust process of public and parliamentary scrutiny and the Westminster principles of ministerial accountability. It is for these reasons that the government will not be supporting the bill.</span>

                    </a>  I know, Senator Patrick, that you're trying to push yourself up on the Centre Alliance ticket in South Australia for the next election. I saw the poor performance of your party at the last election, so I understand why you're doing it, Senator Patrick. But, again, can I offer you a little bit of advice: try to focus on issues that affect South Australians, like the River Murray and like defence contracts. Stick to something that might improve the status of people in South Australia.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill seeks to impose security checks and processes on members of the executive and to allow the Prime Minister to receive this information confidentially in the form of reports from the Director-General of Security. As highlighted in the bill's explanatory memorandum, ministers occupy a position of both authority and trust in our democratic framework. Cabinet ministers are privy to the highest levels of sensitive material, including involving matters of national security and classified information. In the view of the opposition, the bill proposed by Senator Patrick does not achieve any of the substantial improvements to the ministerial or cabinet processes.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill highlights the contrast between public servants and ministerial staff acquiring security clearances and procedures while elected members and appointed ministers are exempt from this process.

                    </a>  Thank you, Deputy President. Our system deliberately differs from, for example, the United States, where members of the executive branch are not drawn from the legislature and, therefore, are spared the scrutiny of the electoral process. As the bill references, Australia's constitutional framework ensures a minister shall not hold office for more than three months unless he or she becomes a senator or member of the House of Representatives and, therefore, subject to the scrutiny of the electoral process. Additionally, there exists a clear conflict with the role and the supremacy of the elected legislature and the appointed executive by the government of the day.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Although the bill does not seek to impose any real or practical obligation on members on the executive as a result of the checks for security purposes, there still exists a conflict on what basis an independent ministerial appointment should be made by the Prime Minister of the day. For these reasons, the opposition will not be supporting the bill proposed by Senator Patrick. Labor remains committed to further consideration of our security processes and democratic integrity measures. However, these changes must be considered carefully and take into consideration the democratic principles on which our system of government is founded.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think we'd all agree that Senator Patrick's interest in national security matters is laudable. In the previous parliament, he and I sat together on the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit, which, interestingly, in the course of the last parliament, conducted a number of inquiries into the Auditor-General's work around security matters and the security framework that operates in our country. While I don't doubt or dismiss Senator Patrick's forensic approach to issues like this, I think on this matter he's wrong and the bill doesn't deserve to be supported.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it is worth reiterating some of the comments Senator Paterson made in his contribution. The first of those, of course, was that the government already does have extensive vetting processes in place for ministerial staff and for public servants which Senator Patrick proposes to, effectively, be extended to include ministers. Senator Patrick's bill would require the Prime Minister, within 14 days of the appointment of a minister, to direct the director-general of ASIO to investigate and provide a report on 'matters relating to security'âwhich is a direct quote from his proposed legislationâincluding the personal background and circumstances of ministers. The director-general must then provide the report to the Prime Minister within 120 days, which must be returned to ASIO upon the Prime Minister ceasing to hold that office. The existing process for ministerial staff and public servants is comprehensive and appropriate, we on the government side would argue. Depending on the level of clearance required, it can involve identity and citizenship verification, a police check, statutory declarations, referee checks, a digital footprint check, financial history check, an ASIO assessment, a security interview and a psychological assessment. So there is a very extensive list of tests that needs to be applied.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, there are very good reasons why ministers and their staff and public servants should be treated differently when it comes to security vetting. In the Westminster system, the only qualification for ministerial office is, first, election by the people to be a member of parliament and, second, an invitation by the Prime Minister to join the ministry. Along with every other member of parliament, ministers are required to publicly declare any relevant interests they may have which could influence them in the exercise of their duties. Ministers are accountable to this parliament and have to front up on a regular basis in question time, estimates and other forums to be questioned on their conduct and performance in the role. So there is already in our country a high level of transparency and with that transparency, I would argue, comes a high level of public and private accountability. Introducing a third qualification whereby ministers would be required, in effect, to pass a bureaucratic process in order to hold office undermines the Westminster system of government, and I think that was a point that Senator Farrell was trying to make in his contribution.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is entirely appropriate, we argue, for ministerial staff and public servants to undergo security vetting because they are entering into an employment relationship. But ministers are not employees; they are public officials. With that status comes public scrutiny and accountability that cannot be equally applied to staff. I am someone, like Senator Paterson, who would argue that that public scrutiny and accountability is at a higher level and is more intense than is applied to staff. Public servants and ministerial staff do not stand for election and expose themselves to public and media scrutiny. And I think it's fair to say that, in our country, public and media scrutiny is robust, is intense and serves the public interest well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The burden for ensuring that ministers are qualified and appropriate for their role rightly falls to the Prime Minister. Any prime minister knows their appointments will be scrutinised through the democratic parliamentary and political processes we have in place. Of course, party leaders also must exercise good judgement in choosing their frontbench teams, and that has not always been the case. And, while I don't want to reflect too much on some of the high personalities and high stakes, this chamber has seen some people become very real and very public casualties as a result of what were private matters that were subsequently properly exposed through the media in appropriate public scrutiny. Of course, Senator Dastyari's name is one that comes to mind most immediately when we think about that set of circumstances. Yet, even in that instance, the best protection our political system has against unsuitable appointments remains public scrutiny.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To your credit, Senator Patrick, I don't mind saying that you are, have been and will continue to be a very strong advocate for increased levels of public scrutiny and increased levels of transparency. But, like I said, on this particular point I think that your concern is unwarranted and that this legislative proposal is unnecessary. A confidential security vetting process as proposed by Senator Patrick is no substitution for a robust process of public and parliamentary scrutiny and the Westminster principles of ministerial accountability.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think this is a very critical point: some people have the false belief that, by putting something into law or regulation, you somehow improve the transparency processes in our country. I caution that. Often I hear people say, 'Oh, because it's in the law or because it's in regulation, we don't have to have the same level of intensity around our other scrutiny processes,' like the media process, like the public process or, indeed, like parliamentary scrutiny and adhering to the principles of the Westminster system of government. So I think sometimes we can find false comfort, false sanctuary, in more regulations and more legislation and people then take their eye off the existing mechanisms for high levels of public scrutiny, like our Senate processes and our parliamentary processes more generally. For these reasons the government's not inclined to support this particular piece of legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is worth reminding the Senate that Senator Patrick's bill is before a committee. That committee process is ongoing and, through that process, the onus will be on Senator Patrick and those people in the community who support his proposition to bring forward information that might allow people in this Senate to review their position. If the evidence is more conclusive than it currently isâI doubt that will be the outcome of the committee process but it's not my place to predict what the final outcome will beâlet's see that and let's put that evidence through the proper lens of public scrutiny as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With regard to that, I'll leave my comments there. The bill will, no doubt, come back to the Senate after the committee has concluded its deliberations and then we'll see what the committee process has revealed.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:32</span>):  I see that both the government and the alternative government don't, under any circumstances, want ministers to be subject to any particular security checking. However, I thank the contributors to this debate on the Ministers of State (Checks for Security Purposes) Bill 2019 because it does enliven me to questions and nooks and crannies that will need to be explored in the context of the committee. I do want to address a couple of the points that were raised in the chamber, and I thank people for making their contribution and raising these issues.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Firstly, I do appreciate that the Westminster system is a good system of government. However, to suggest that security checking ministers breaks that down is to just ignore what is happening in Canada. Canada does check its ministers from a security perspective and, indeed, operates under the Westminster system. So I think we can put any concerns in that regard to one side.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The point made by all contributors that ministers are subject to public scrutiny, media scrutiny and parliamentary scrutiny ignores the fact that, when people are being influenced by foreign officials or conducting activities that are not proper, they tend to do that covertly. They don't do that in the chamber, they don't do that in sight of the media and they don't do that in the face of public scrutiny. They actually try to do that in secret. Senators would be aware that's especially problematic as our police forces and our intelligence forces are very aware of their responsibilities and the difficulties in watching what a minister may or may not be doing because it causes a considerable difficulty in respect of parliamentary privilege. We have a situation where these activities will not be done in the daylight. To the extent that they are done in secret, for good reasons, we already tie our security forces hands behind their backs. I reject some of the propositions that have been made but appreciate the early notice of the issues that will no doubt be raised in the committee.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator HANSON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:35</span>):  I ask the question: do you think the current rate of immigration to Australia is too high? Our rate of net immigration is a topic that has regularly made an appearance at the forefront of public debate in recent years and so it should. Immigration impacts considerably on Australia's overall population growth, which in turn impacts on the lifestyles we are all able to experience. It makes common sense to understand that more people means more demand for services. If those services are not established at a pace that keeps up with the growth then lifestyles will go backwards. With the stagnant lifestyles ordinary Australians have been experiencing in the past decade we certainly don't want things to get any worse.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Raising an issue like immigration, in particular the idea of an immigration slowdown, also seems to attract those who want to drag the racism tag into the discussions. It's already happened with this bill and I really expect nothing less from those who have already tossed this issue into the too-hard basket and don't have the fortitude to tackle the difficult matters that affect the lives of all citizens and residents of Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I have said previously, this bill is not about where people originate when they come to live in our great nation or why. It is strictly about the numbers and the impact those numbersâsignificant numbers on a global scale, mind youâare having on our lives here.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia's considerable population growth has been linked quite publicly in recent years to various social issues: infrastructure being unable to keep up with the population growth in our suburbs and services being unable to keep up with the increased demand that results from the collective needs of more people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Infrastructure Australia, an Australian government body, also notes these two concerns. It says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Lags in infrastructure provision cost the economy, but they also affect people's quality of life. If we don't get the timing of new housing and infrastructure right, our growth centres risk being characterised by congested roads, overcrowded trains and buses, over-enrolment in schools, hospital bed shortages and constraints on community infrastructure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My next point: our considerable population growth has been linked to higher demand for housing and subsequently ever rising house prices, which for many Australians now puts owning their own home further out of reach. And it's not just population growth generally. One OECD study notes very clearly that evidence suggests that 'changes in population growth stemming from increases in net migration tend to have a greater influence on real house prices in the medium term than natural increases'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The great and dedicated Australian Dick Smith has spoken about this is. Regarding the housing affordability crisis he very simply said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">â¦ when you consider the scale of its impact on the problem, population growth gets very little scrutiny or debate relative to the other causes involved.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In fact, it is rarely acknowledged at all.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me say it up-front: Australia's immigration-fuelled population growth is a major cause of our country's housing affordability crisis. Mr Smith has also noted the number of years that it now takes to save up for a house deposit by saying 10 per cent of an average wage in 1975 was six years but in 2016 it is 25 years. They are all factors that highlight the impact of our high population growth on the ordinary Australian. The aspiration of owning a home is more and more at risk.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My final dot point is: population growth has also been linked to concerns about increased demands for jobs, stagnant wages growth and subsequent unemployment and underemployment. An ABC analysis noted that Australia currently has a population growth rate of around 1.6 per cent, which is more than double the rate of the United Kingdom and of the USA and is driven, largely, by immigration. Other sources suggest a similar figure of 1.7 per cent growth. The ABC analysis also noted the subsequent impacts on wages and jobs. It said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">â¦ in the short term an increase of the supply of labour through high migration should mean lower wages growth.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It also said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">â¦ there are about 680,000 unemployed Australians and an additional 1 million Australians who have a job, but would likeâ</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's also been acknowledged that many of the jobs created in Australia these days are going to immigrants, further adding to the pressures on jobseekers and their families everywhere.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <span style="font-style:italic;">The Sydney Morning Herald</span> recently noted that in recent years many additional full-time jobs have been created, but it's equally true that many of those jobs have gone to immigrants and other new entrants to the labour force, meaning the rate of unemployment hasn't fallen below five per cent. Despite these facts about our high population growth, there remains the belief in the Australian political and business sphere that high population growth is necessary to achieve high economic growth.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Big business also loves high immigration. Big retailers like Harvey Norman love high immigration because it means there are more customers to buy their products. But the influence of Mr Harvey and other corporate leaders in the debate should be lessened because the focus should be more on the quality of life of Australian residents and citizens, rather than the hip pockets of big businesses.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the period from 1995 to 2011, the UK experience was that mass migration had made the country significantly poorer. There was a considerable difference between the value of the services they claimed and the amount of taxation they paid. The figure was initially estimated at a shortfall of 95 billion pounds but was later revised upwards to 114 billion pounds, before being raised further to 159 billion pounds.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The dot points I outlined suggest that the ordinary Australian, including Mr Morrison's 'quiet Australians', may not necessarily be seeing the supposed benefits of having more and more people coming here who are all seeking to be somehow satisfied in all these specific criteria. It is worth looking at the UK situation with regard to immigration, which has already been mirrored in some areas in Australia. The UK's population is some 2Â½ times that of Australia, and their net migration numbers are around the same as ours. Concern among citizens in the UK over this figure and the impact it was having on life in the UK can be attributed considerably to the result of the Brexit vote in 2016. Australia's current net migration, according to the latest budget papers, is around 271,000 people. It's not the figure of 190,000 that was bandied around in March just prior to the election, but why let the facts get in the way of a good story when an election is coming?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">New migrants to the UK have almost seen it as arriving in heaven. They have often arrived from nations where living conditions are poorer, so the conditions of their new home, even though they might be poor by UK standards, are wonderful in comparison. Jobs are potentially more readily available to them because they are often prepared to work for low wages that are much higher than those in their previous country of origin. In the book<span style="font-style:italic;"> The Strange Death of Europe</span><span style="font-style:italic;">: Immigration, Identity, Islam</span>, author Douglas Murray notes that:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">High among the reasons why people flock to Europe are the knowledge that its welfare states will look after migrants who arrive, and the knowledge that however long it takes or however poorly migrants may be looked after they will still enjoy a better standard of living and a better roster of rights than anywhere else, let alone in their home countries.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">New migrant workers are an attractive option for businesses. Because of this mindset, there is a demise of opportunities for existing citizens and residents.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to ensure the UK situation does not take hold more strongly here, so it's important that this issue is debated properly and that the facts and figures are clear for all to see. To use the terminology of Mr Murray, the situation 'will see people at the lower end of that market edged out of jobs by people from countries where wages and living standards are far lower and who are therefore willing to work for lower pay'.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have seen elements of that emerging in Australia, with some migrants and overseas student workers being exploited because they either accept lower wages or are oblivious to our legal wage minimums. Either way, they are filling jobs at a higher rate than that of other Australians and residents. It is not good for those looking for work, and it's not good for our economy. To add further to this situation, a high number of the migrants who are now experiencing and benefiting from the better living conditions of the UK, as they also do in Australia, are sending money back to family members still living in poorer conditions in their former homelands. Murray, again, said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The reality is that whatever its other benefits, the economic benefits of immigration accrue almost solely to the migrant. It is migrants who are able to access public facilities that have not been previously paid for. It is migrants who benefit from a wage higher than they could earn in their home country, and very often the money that they earn, or much of it, is sent to family outside the United Kingdom rather than being put back into the local economy. It is clear that economies of the host nation are impacted negatively by high rates of immigration.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I touched on earlier, the Australian Prime Minister recently spoke of the aspirations of Australians: aspirations for a job, perhaps an apprenticeship, to start their own business or own a home and save for a comfortable retirement. These are typical traditional Australian aspirations. They are actually quite modest. But let's be honest: for many people they are slipping out of reach. In the past, they were almost a given. They were life's achievements, and they were quite reachable if you had a stable job and lived a sensible life. However, high immigration levels, among other things, are very much the cause of putting the barriers up that prevent these simple aspirations from being achieved. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since 2007 Australia's population has grown by five million, an overall increase of 25 per cent. There are predictions that our population will grow further in the next 50 years to 50 million people. I believe it will be more if we keep going at the rate we're going. Quite alarmingly, 60 per cent of Australia's population growth from 2006 to 2016 came from immigration. The impacts of immigration on areas of provision of services, employment, homeownership and the like also had noticeable impacts on other aspects of life, that is starting and building a family. Mr Murray notes, 'In the UK the majority of new births are from immigrants rather than existing citizens and residents.' If it is agreed that a particular country wishes to maintain a stable or slowly growing population, then before importing people from other states surely it would surely be more sensible to determine whether there are reasons why people in your own country are not at present having enough children. He adds, 'Only three types of people now have three children or more: the very rich, the very poor and recent immigrants.' </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Is the high rate of growth by immigration good or bad? With all these facts and figures on the table I think it is a legitimate topic to debate. So I come back to my original question: do you think the current rate of immigration to Australia is too high? I believe I know the answer, but I think all Australians, those who live and breathe the consequences of our population growth every day, those who drive the congested roads and are on the crowded buses and trains and are stuck in the rental roundabout because house prices just keep rising while wages levels remain stagnant, should be given the chance to vote on this issue so we can find out, once and for all, what the people really think.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my previous speech on this topic I noted that the Lowy Institute survey reported a sharp spike in anti-immigration sentiment in 2018, causing its annual sentiment measure to change from positive to negative. The 2017 Scanlon survey reported 37 per cent of respondents see the current immigration intake as too high, but, when respondents remained anonymous, 74 per cent said that Australia did not need any more people. In the same year, the Australian Population Research Institute found that 54 per cent of respondents who were Australian voters wanted the number of immigrants reduced. So let's do a proper vote. Let every voter have a say and find out what all the people think together.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's what I'm proposing in this bill, the Plebiscite (Future Migration Level) Bill 2018. I am proposing that a plebiscite be held, coinciding with the next federal election to ensure better convenience and to reduce costs, to ask all Australians their views on this high-impact issue. Let Australians be allowed to cast a vote, yes or no, and so collectively reveal if they believe our immigration rates are in fact too high. From there, we can determine what needs to be done to our immigration processes to make any changes that will have the flow-on effect that will improve general liveability in Australia, employment, housing affordability, less crowding in schools and hospitals, and similar issues.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Prime Minister has previously raised the issue of an immigration cap to keep net migration to Australia at 160,000. A suggestion by former Prime Minister Tony Abbott, following my lead, was that the figure should be cut further, perhaps as low as 110,000âI have even commented as low as 75,000âuntil we can get infrastructure and services for the Australian people and clean up our own backyard. We're met by concern as to whether it would blow out Australia's deficit further. The comments all add to the many mixed opinions and viewpoints that have contributed to this debate on this issue in the past.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Is the current rate of immigration to Australia too high? Let's put this simple question to the people, if the people in this parliament or this government have got the guts to do it. Let's hold the plebiscite, and hold it to coincide with the next federal election so we keep the cost down. Let's not sit on our hands on this issue any longer. Let's take steps to understand exactly what the people think, and then act with confidence on the resulting useful information. Yesterday I put a post on my Facebook page, Pauline Hanson's Please Explain, flagging this plebiscite, and in less than 24 hours it received more than 7,100 comments. That is quite staggering. It shows very clearly that people want to have their say on this matter. With all the politicians having their input, big businesses and researchers having their say, and academics putting in their two cents' worth about immigration, don't you think it's time for everyday Australians to also be heard? That, after all, is what democracy is all about.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="237920" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator STOKER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:53</span>):  I rise to speak against the private senators' bill, the Plebiscite (Future Migration Level) Bill 2018, put forward by Senator Hanson. There's nothing noble about this bill. It's long on alarmism and short on realism. No surprise, perhaps, given it has come from the party that has tried to push their anti-immigration agenda by moving a motion that praised the North Sentinelese tribe's strict zero-immigration policyâyes, the same tribe that killed American missionary John Chow last year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm not here to question the motives behind the bill; they pale in comparison to the weak arguments on which the bill is built. Senator Hanson has said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Our immigration policy is like a rider-less horse. It is dangerous. What we need is a rider, a population policy to safely guide the immigration horse.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Can I tell you that everything, and I mean everything, the government does in this space it does with the Australian people in mind. The Treasurer has an entire department. There is a tax office which looks at how many people we have, who is working, who isn't, how long we'll have those workers doing so or how long until we get some more, where those workers are and what they're earning to guide tax collection and spending. And they're not working in the dark. The Australian Bureau of Statistics falls under the auspices of the Treasurer too. Likewise, the health minister looks at the population: where are the older people, where are the unvaccinated children, where do we need more doctors? I think you get the idea. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To help Senator Hanson understand just how much the health minister can read these things in real time, the Health Insurance Commission also collects statistics on the matter. If a person gets the flu and goes to the doctor before they go to bed for a week, we'll know about it. When that person becomes a number in the Australian Influenza Surveillance Report, it helps to inform our decision-making. In case you're wondering, there have been 153,272 cases of influenza this year up to 14 July. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Indeed, many people are probably uncomfortable with the amount of data that's being collected about Australians with a view to managing population and service delivery, but all of this shows that it isn't the government's first rodeo on this stuff. We understand the flow-on effects of population growth on the economy, on services, on Australians' day-to-day lives. Every day members of the team in cabinet, the ministry and our backbench are looking at population and adjusting policy and spending to deal with population changes. And, to top it all off, we have the population centre of excellence gathering all that data, comparing it against Australians' needs, now and in the future, and against other international options. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a clear immigration policy. It's called 'A plan for Australia's future population'âcreative, that oneâand it manages Australia's immigration program in the short, medium and long term. Our plan reduces the permanent migration program cap by 15 per cent from 190,000 places to 160,000 places per year. That will make 120,000 fewer permanent visas available over the next four years. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Hanson is concerned, it seems, that certain regions of our major cities have higher percentages of people who were born overseas. The government recognises that 75 per cent of Australia's entire population growth occurs, at this point in time, in our major cities. That's why our population plan encourages more new migrants to settle outside of our big cities and in smaller cities and regional areas. We're incentivising regional migration with two new regional visas for skilled workers: the skilled employer sponsored regional visa and the skilled work regional visa. Migrants on these visas will need to demonstrate that they have lived and worked in regional Australia for three years before they can apply for permanent residency, and 23,000 places have been set aside from the total for these regional visas. The hope and the expectation is that they will fall in love with all the wonderful things that rural and regional Australia has to offer. We have set up new $15,000 scholarships to be made available to over 1,000 international and domestic students to study in regional Australiaâagain, knowing that they will find it irresistible. And international students studying at regional universities will have access to an extra year in Australia on a post-study work visa. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Hanson has argued that one of the biggest drawbacks of higher immigration is greater congestion and loss of amenity in our main cities, and I acknowledge that that's something that many people are concerned about. That's part of the reason why the government is investing a record $100 billionânot million, billionâin infrastructure over the next 10 years. Some examples of projects where funding will cut congestion in Australia's cities include $3.5 billion for the Western Sydney rail; $2 billion for fast rail to be built between Geelong and Melbourne; and $1 billion to upgrade the M1 in Queensland as well as exploration of fast rail heading to the Sunshine Coast also in my home state. We've quadrupled funds for further road congestion-busting projects through the Urban Congestion Fund, from $1 billion to $4 billion, and we're working with the states and territories to deliver vital infrastructure projects that match local population needs. We've made population management a fixture of COAG discussions, and I think that's a significant cultural change in the way people are approaching this issue.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Centre for Population, which I referred to earlier in my address, has been established inside Treasury, and $23.4 million had been provided to establish that centre. There are about 20 people working in there doing nothing but looking at population. They will provide detailed analysis and advice on population issues now and in the future to help make sure that we have an informed debate on these subjects.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All of these elements of our plan will help to ease population pressures in our major capitals while helping to fill employment gaps in our smaller cities and regions and to grow their economies. That's what a sensible rate of immigration doesâit helps to build our economic prosperity. But not once does Senator Hanson's bill address the need to ensure that we have economic prosperity and the role that immigration plays in ensuring that, both in our past and in our future. At this point in time there is necessity for immigration at some level to ensure our high economic performance and Australians' high expectations of living standards are met.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Hanson says that the majority of Australians would say that the immigration rate is too high if they were told that 62 per cent of the population increase in the decade to 2016 was the result of immigration. Well, that may be so, but what would Australians say about our immigration level if they were told more honestly that, overwhelmingly, migrants have added to our nation by stimulating stronger growth, by creating jobs in our economy, by oftentimes doing jobs that Australians don't seem to want to do and by helping to slow the overall ageing of the Australian population? </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A comprehensive research paper released by Treasury and the Department of Home Affairs last year found exactly this. It cites International Monetary Fund research showing our immigration program in its current state will add up to one percentage point to GDP growth each year from 2022 to 2050. The report found that our immigration programs' focus on skilled migrants of working ageâthat's important; we do need to be developing the skills base in this countryâhelped to limit the economic impact of Australia's ageing population. The contribution of these skilled migrants has lifted the standard of living here by 0.1 per cent of GDP per capita, increased productivity by 10 per centâquite disproportionately, I'd suggestâand raised the workforce participation rate. Skilled migrants granted permanent visas in 2014-15 alone are estimated to make a combined lifetime tax contribution of almost $7 billion. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But here's the kicker. The Treasury paper warns that, if the current rate of migration is not maintained, we risk significantly lower economic growth and a substantial drop in Australians' living standards. You have to wonder whether those from One Nation plan to put that research before the Australian people if this mooted plebiscite were to go ahead. But, of course, they won't. The government understands and those opposite understandâand Senator Hanson should understandâthat the fundamentals of this bill are flawed. I acknowledge that there are those in the community who hold concerns about our immigration levelsâand I hear from them often. It's no wonder that they're scared when there is divisive rhetoric put forward by some in this chamber.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've got concerns about plebiscitesâfundamentally because it's our job to make the call on these things: to do the research, to gather the data, to make the fair and balanced case and ultimately to make decisions, and rise and fall on whether we get them right. I'm not a fan of a sustained practice of farming out to a plebiscite anything that's in the too-hard basket. But, putting that aside, it's not necessary, because this government has a plan for responsible levels of immigration. To reduce immigration as far as Senator Hanson proposesâdown to just 70,000 people a yearâwould pose a major risk to our economy. It risks our AAA credit rating. It risks our record economic growth at a time when there is global uncertainty. It risks the headway that we have made to boost our economy with the passage of our personal income tax cuts package.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Over 320,000 jobs were created under this government over the last year. Employment has grown for 11 straight months, with unemployment down to 5.1 per cent. The participation rate is at a record high of 65.8 per cent. Last quarter the economy grew by 0.4 per cent, bringing the yearly growth rate to 1.8 per cent. We are in our 28th year of uninterrupted annual economic growth. Are there challenges ahead? Sure, but that's all the more reason we shouldn't jeopardise that steady, positive performance. And until all Australians experience the benefits of that growing economy, until Australians are feeling the benefits of rising wages as well as more job opportunities, we cannot rest.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill seeks to affirm a policy that would put all this economic improvement at risk. Why would we ask the Australian people to support a policy that is so plainly against their own economic interests? This country can attribute much of its economic success to our immigration programâin combination with other activities, of courseâand our growing numbers are being managed successfully through the government's population plan. This bill endorses a solution that would have catastrophic consequences for our economy, for a problem that is already being addressed by this government in a sensible, measured and long-sighted way. For that reason, I cannot support it. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="281503" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CICCONE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:06</span>):  I rise also today to speak against Senator Hanson's private member's bill, the Plebiscite (Future Migration Level) Bill 2018. As senators will remember, when this bill was initially introduced in the last parliament, Labor opposed it vigorously. Our position has not changed. The plebiscite does not do anything other than provide a question. There is no definitive outcome on immigration rates or levels, regardless of what the outcome of the vote is. We recognise that the story of our country, the story of us, is tied to our heritage as a migration nation. Migrants come to Australiaâa lot doâbut they come here in search of a better life, not just for themselves but for their families. And why wouldn't they? After all, we live in the greatest country on earth.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Today nearly half of all Australians either were born overseas or have at least one parent who was. In my own case, my parents came here in the late 1960s because they knew that Australia was a country where they could work hard, get ahead and create a future for their children. They're not alone. They join roughly 7Â½ million others since the end of World War II. We owe much of our prosperity as a nation to those who made this journey. Indeed, the Australia that we all know and enjoy today simply would not have been possible were it not for the contribution of people who were born overseas and their children and grandchildren.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Hanson has ignored the benefits of migration, particularly the economic benefits. Migrants have helped to drive our economy. One in three small businesses in Australia are run by migrants, and migrant owners employ around 1.4 million workers right across Australia. As outlined by Treasury in the April 2018 report <span style="font-style:italic;">Shaping </span><span style="font-style:italic;">a</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">n</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ation</span>, the contribution to our economy by migrant intake alone was worth $10 billion over five years. That report stated:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">â¦ migration improves the Commonwealth's fiscal position, since migrants are likely to contribute more to tax revenue than they claim in social services or other government support.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my home state of Victoria, one can barely walk down a mall or shopping strip without seeing the value that migrants make to our economy. But central to the defence against the kind of divisiveness proposed in this bill is not merely the important role that migration plays in our economy; rather, it is advancing the vision that we all have for this great nation. In Melbourne, what would Lygon Street be without the coffee machines brought over the seas by migrants from Italy? What would Box Hill be without its numerous dumpling restaurants opened by Chinese migrants who wanted to make something for themselves? What would Oakleigh be without the smell of roasting meat cooked in the traditional Greek way gently wafting down Eaton Mall?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor understands Australians are frustrated with stagnant wages, unaffordable housing and clogged infrastructure; however, migrants are not to blame. The truth is that this nation would not be what it is today without the contributions made to it by those who have come here in the hope of making a great contribution to Australia. It is not for us to subject this to a divisive and, speaking perfectly honestly, hurtful plebiscite. Whilst Labor accepts that this is importantâmaking sure that we get the balance right in managing our migration programâthis is the responsibility of the government with the best advice at hand. There is simply no place in our inclusive and proudly diverse nation for an expensive opinion poll on questions that don't need to be asked.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator HANSON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:21</span>):  The Human Services Amendment (Photographic Identification and Fraud Prevention) Bill 2019 is intended to achieve exactly what it says: to stop, by including photographic indication, a Medicare card from being used by someone other than the person to whom it is issued. Presently there is nothing to stop someone from sharing their Medicare card with anyone who hasn't been issued with a card or is not eligible for a card in order to source medical services at a cost to the government. I say this because it was brought to my attention by someone whose cousin was visiting Australia and needed to go to the doctor. He borrowed his cousin's Medicare card, went to the doctor and was then put into hospital. He actually died. The owner of the card, an Australian citizen, had to notify the authorities that the person who had actually died was using his name. He was not fined. He was asked to pay the costs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What I'm saying is that people travelling to Australia as tourists or illegals in the country can access their friends' and families' cards to use at the doctor's, at the hospital or for any medical service that requires a Medicare card and get the taxpayer to pick up the bill. As a result, health providers have no way of verifying that the name on the card is that of the person they are treating.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Eligibility for a Medicare card is available to Australian and New Zealand citizens as well as visitors from a range of countries with which Australia has reciprocal agreements. These countries include Belgium, Finland, Italy, Malta, the Netherlands, Norway, Ireland, Slovenia, Sweden and the United Kingdom. Why on earth would we have reciprocal agreements with these countries?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The United Kingdom has a population of 65 million. We have a population of 25 million. People who are travelling out from England to Australia can access our health care at a huge cost to the taxpayer. I think this is a big problemâthat people who go to our hospitals in the states are not paying for their care if there is a reciprocal agreement. Hence it is a burden on the taxpayers here in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We all know that when you travel today, if your travel arrangements are done on a credit card, most of the time the credit card covers that health insurance. We know that a lot of people take out their own personal health insurance, which should be the case. We should not have reciprocal agreements with other countries, especially when their population far exceeds that of Australia's. It's about time we started cleaning up our health act, because the cost to the taxpayers is exorbitant, and we can't give the people in this country the decent health care they need.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Anyone who has a permanent resident visa can also get a card if living in Australia. Even if they aren't, they continue to be eligible for Medicare for 12 months after leaving the country. I can't believe that even 12 months after leaving the country we give them Medicare. You may also get a Medicare card if you live in Australia and have applied for a permanent residency visa or permanent protection visa, provided that you are on a visa allowing you to work or you are the parent, spouse or child of an Australian citizen or permanent resident or a New Zealand citizen living here. It makes me ask this question: if we've got people coming into Australia who come in on a three-month visa and then pull the stunt that they want to stay in Australia, that they're a refugee, they go before the administrative tribunal and overturn the administrative decision that they have to leave the country, they are then put on a bridging visa and the decision could take two years to come down, at a cost of near nothing for them to take through the courts and then they're allowed to work in Australia, do they also get the Medicare card? Are they provided with health care? And prior to the decision being brought down that they must leave the country, they leave, because they've worked here, they've made the money, they've got everything provided for them, and then they leave because they've made the money they wanted to make.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're being taken for mugs in this countryâabsolute mugsâand you don't do anything about it. The fact is that I see here in Canberra people sleeping out on the streets at night who can't get care or homes. I know of people who wait months if not years to have a necessary operation, and we can't provide that. We can't even open up hospital wards or beds because we haven't got the money or the services to provide to the Australian people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are additional ways of qualifying for the free or subsidised health benefits a Medicare card provides, depending on the type of visa you have been granted. As it stands, the use of Medicare cards is wide open to rorting, with nothing to stop a person who does not qualify for free or subsidised medical assistance from borrowing a card from a friend, as does happen. That's exactly what I've explained, and I'll go on further to say that it was told to me years ago that our health system, especially drugsâpeople coming out here and accessing our doctors to get script after script and then get the medications providedâis costing us to the tune of about $1 billion a year. This is a cost to the Australian taxpayer. And that's exactly what they do: they come out, visit our country, go from doctor to doctor. There's no identification on the card whatsoever. These people are doctor shopping. Then they get the scripts, get the scripts filled, take the medications back to their own countries and sell them on the black market. And of course, if that card is tied to someone who's on a welfare payment, they don't pay the full price for a script. Usually it's only a couple of dollars, a few dollars. Again, we're being ripped off. I ask anyone here in this chamber, or anyone who's listening to this: when was the last time someone checked your ID card when you used your Medicare card? I can assure you it's never happened to me. But, then again, I'm more well known than a lot of the other senators in this place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But the whole fact is that you go somewhere and you're asked for identification. What identification? A card. In 2012 I went over to Thailand with <span style="font-style:italic;">A Current Affair </span>and I did a program on cards. You can buy Medicare cards in the street. You can buy drivers licences in the street. And the problem is that, when we go to some place and they say, 'Show some identification,' and you pull out a card, usually that person behind the counter has no idea what they're looking for. They see the colour of the card; it looks exactly the same. It could be one of these cards that you can pick up over the internet or that you can buy on the streets of Thailand for $50. I've heard you can get them as cheap as $30. So what happens is that, over a period of the time, with these false drivers licences, false credit cards and false Medicare cards, you're building up your 100 points; when you finally do get the legitimate item you can start rorting the system.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Surely people can see how far behind the eight ball we are. We are backwards when it comes to identification. How many times in this chamber have we spoken about security? But we've never really addressed the concerns here to do with the Medicare card. Why is it not possible to have identification on Medicare cardsâto have your photograph on it, like we do on our drivers licences, and to have a chip in it which gets swiped so we know that it is you and we have the information that we need? These are important matters that need to be discussed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The 2018-19 budget for Medicareâor medical benefits, as it is labelledâis $24.1 billion, compared to an estimated total expenditure in 2017-18 of $23.3 billion. It is forecast to grow to $25.5 billion in 2019-20, $26.8 billion in 2020-21 and $28.2 billion in 2021-22. Medicare costs represent a significant part of the country's health budget, and this is growing as the population ages. Possession of a Medicare card has a financial value to whoever uses it, representing free or subsidised health care. Passports and drivers licences are protected, in part, from fraudulent use by having photographic identification of the person to whom they are issued. I see no reason why this should not also apply to Medicare cards.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to hear the response in this chamber from any senator who'll give me a legitimate reason why a photograph should not be on our Medicare card to protect against fraudulent activity? Is there any sound reason why it should not be on the card? Surely we have a duty of care to the taxpayers of this nation to ensure that their tax dollars are not being ripped off? Too often do I hear in this chamber that people are saying, 'We need the money.' I have charities and different organisations that are crying out for help and assistance. Just to have half a million dollars or a million dollars would go so far in helping their organisation. If we tackled this problem with the Medicare card, we could ensure that only Australian citizens or permanent residentsâpeople who are truly entitled to use itâhave the use of that card. If it is true that we have 65,000 or 70,000 people who are in this country illegally, what are they doing for their health services? Are they paying with cash, or are they using the cards of their family or friends to go to the doctor? Are they utilising our health services and our hospitals and taking up beds they are not entitled to?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It would be very easy for us to get on top of this and ensure there is photographic identification of every Australian, regardless of who they are. Even those people out there who care to wear a burqa should show their face on their Medicare card, and anyone who does not want to have a photograph taken, like for a drivers licence, pays full price; they don't get the benefits of it. If you want taxpayer funded services, whether it be Medicare or anything else, then prove who you are. If it's good enough for drivers licences and if it's good enough for passports then it's good enough for Medicare. They must actually prove who they are. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I believe that this bill will stop fraudulent use and the consequent drain on the health budget. It will strengthen the integrity of the Medicare schemeâsurely an outcome which everyone would welcome. I'm sure you understand that in many other countries around the world there is strain on health care. In the United States and Britain, there is huge strain on their health care. We have a responsibility to the people here to have the money going into the future to provide the decent health care that the Australian people should have, but that all comes at a cost.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The posturing that goes on in this place about stupid bills and other things that we spend so much of our time on is not dealing with the real issues that the people want us to deal with. It's all about getting things right. I hope the bloody-minded attitude stops. Make the changes that the people are demanding and crying out for. Stop the fraudulent activity that's happening in this country, and get photographic identification on our Medicare cards to stop those people who are abusing our system so that we have Medicare here in the long run.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="F49" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CAROL BROWN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:37</span>):  I rise to speak on the Human Services Amendment (Photographic Identification and Fraud Prevention) Bill 2019. This bill seeks to amend the Human Services (Medicare) Act 1973 to include a requirement that photographic identification be present on Medicare cards. Senator Hanson states that this is to militate against fraudulent use of a Medicare card by someone other than the person to whom it is allocated. As a matter of principle, Labor will support considered and sensible measures that address Medicare fraud.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In considering this support, it is important to be clear about whether fraud is occurring presently; if it is, how that fraud is occurring; whether this bill will have the effect of addressing fraud, if, indeed, fraud is occurring; whether what is proposed in this bill is the most effective way of achieving the outcome of addressing Medicare fraud; the financial impact of the proposed changes; the impact on individuals, especially as it relates to their privacy; the impact on providers, especially medical practitioners, psychologists and others who bill to Medicare; and the government's capacity to implement any proposed changes. The impact on privacy is especially important, and I will go into this in more detail later. The red-tape impact of the proposed changes must also be considered. Finally, it is important to consider any unintended consequences of the bill. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a huge number of Medicare transactions every day. According to the Australian Medical Association, there are 45,000 provider interactions with Health Professional Online Services every day and an estimated 27,000 HPOS confirmations of Medicare details; and, in the last year, 148.8 million GP services were claimed against Medicare. The AMA said in 2017:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">There is no evidence of a systemic problem and no evidence that patients' health information has been compromised. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">From the outset, it should be noted that there are additional ways that a person's identity can be verified through the use of their Medicare card. In 2011 Medicare cards were added to the Attorney-General's Department's Document of Verification Service, DVS. To quote a government report from 2017: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The DVS is a secure, online system that enables user organisations to match information on a range of evidence of identity documents against the corresponding record of the document issuing agency. In addition to helping to strengthen the integrity of Medicare cards, the DVS provides a government-endorsed method for their verification, including for private sector organisations such as banks and telecommunications providers which have legislated customer identification requirements. The DVS operates 24 hours a day and can provide verification of identity documents within seconds. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Medicare cards are now the second most commonly verified document through the DVS: during 2016-17 around 4.6 million or 15 per cent of all DVS transactions were conducted using Medicare card data. More than half (55 per cent) of these checks were conducted by the private sector.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This detail is worth knowing, in the context of the significant changes proposed in this bill. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also need to consider the practical consequences and, potentially, unintended consequences of what this bill proposes. One obvious implication that must be considered, in the context of the changes this bill proposes, is that for many families it is not just an individual but several members of a family on a Medicare card. The practical consideration of having current photos of children as they age or shifting to individual cards, to avoid having many photographs on the one Medicare card, is something that would need to be explored, in detail, if this proposal were to be given serious consideration. This alone would preclude this bill from being agreed to in its current form. As I said at the outset, Labor will support sensible measures to address Medicare fraud. But there are many actual and, potentially, unintended consequences, where this bill would affect that need, to be considered in proper detail. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Accordingly, in considering changes of this magnitude, a process ought to be established that allows all affected stakeholders to provide their input into the proposal and for the government to thoroughly examine all of these issues. We can, therefore, look to what has been considered in the past, when similar questions and proposals have been considered. There has been a significant body of work done quite recently into the proposal raised in this bill. In July 2017 the government commissioned the <span style="font-style:italic;">Independent Review of Health Providers</span><span style="font-style:italic;">'</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> Access to Medicare Card Numbers</span>. The purpose of this review was:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">â¦ to consider the balance between appropriate access to Medicare card numbers for health professionals  and the security of patients' Medicare card numbers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was in response to media reports that Australians' Medicare data had been breached and was available for sale on the dark web. The review was chaired by former Secretary of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet Professor Peter Shergold; the president of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners, Dr Bastian Seidel; then president of the Australian Medical Association Dr Michael Gannon; and Dr Kean-Seng Lim, deputy chair of the Australian Medical Association Council of General Practice. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This review made 14 representations, informed by presentations and written submissions from professionals and community and consumer organisations. The recommendations covered the specifics in this bill, such as whether photographic ID or some other form of security, like a hologram, should be on a person's Medicare card. The review panel also considered whether a person should have to provide a secondary form of ID when they first attend a health service. There were a number of significant groups that were opposed to this proposal, which I will come to later. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of particular relevance to the proposal raised in this bill is the review's observation that for some groups their Medicare card is their principal source of ID. The National Aboriginal Community Controlled Health Organisation submitted to the review:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Many of our Aboriginal patients use their Medicare card as their only form of identification â many do not have a Drivers' License or a Proof of Identity card. If this was no longer available for use as a form of identification, this would make access to essential welfare services extremely difficult for our patients.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To also quote the review panel directly in response to this, they say:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is the Review Panel's view that any measure taken to prevent Medicare cards being used as a recognised form of secondary evidence of identity, as some submissions have suggested, has the potential to disadvantage certain vulnerable members of the community. It would also have significant impacts on a range of government and private sector organisations, and have a flow on effect on consumers, particularly in the telecommunications sector which has legislated customer identification requirements for pre-paid mobile phones. The education sector would also be significantly affected considering the Medicare card is used to support the issuance of a large number of Unique Student Identifiers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To this point, the first recommendation of the review panel was 'that the Medicare card be retained as a form of secondary evidence for identity purposes'. The review panel also specifically considered whether having a photographic ID on a Medicare card might have the effect of reducing fraud.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The review panel responded to that proposal:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Review Panel noted that while adding a photograph or other security feature such as a hologram might have a short term beneficial impact on the illegal reproduction of Medicare cards, such changes are not likely to have a lasting effect. A more practical and immediate measure is for organisations that accept Medicare cards as evidence of identity to utilise the DVS to confirm that the card and/or number being presented corresponds with a valid and current record held by the Department of Human Services.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As mentioned, the review also considered whether another source of ID in addition to a Medicare card should be presented when a person presents at a health facility for the first time. The Northern Territory Department of Health said of this proposal:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The NT does not support introducing additional identity requirements for this purpose as this has the potential to put added pressure on remote clinics and impact disproportionately on remote (particularly Aboriginal) people â¦</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In short, it would be logistically challenging and impractical to require all patients to provide more than one type of identification aligning to their Medicare card. Further, any such requirement must not be able to be used as a reason to deny access to essential health care.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Medical Association said, 'It would place an additional administrative burden on practices and put in place an unnecessary barrier to care for patients.' The Australian Privacy Foundation said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">At the outset the Foundation emphasises the fundamental importance of trust as a basis of the delivery of health services to all Australians, including in instances where a recipient may not hold a card or other token of entitlement to services. Respect for that trust through a coherent, principled and effective privacy regime is not antithetical to good governance, efficiency and responsiveness to individual needs.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">It is critically important to remember health services, particularly in remote areas, that they continue to have access to clients Medicare numbers which:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The review panel's finding on this point was as follows:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Existing requirements around patient identification for clinical safety purposes would be consistent with a requirement that health professionals should be confident of the identity of their patients for Medicare billing purposes, and this should not pose a barrier to care. This would provide assurance that patients are using their own identity to access healthcare, and that they are eligible to receive a Medicare benefit.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee did also recommend:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">â¦ as a condition of claiming Medicare benefits on behalf of patients, health professionals should be required to take reasonable steps to confirm the identity of patients when they are first treated.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government formally responded to the review panel's report in February 2018. I note that it agreed, without qualification, to 13 of the review panel's 14 recommendations and agreed, in principle, to the other recommendation, pending further examination of implementation options. One of the main changes resulting from this is that health providers seek another source of identification in addition to a person's Medicare card when presenting at a health service. Of this change, the government, in response to the review panel's report, said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This should not be onerous, and should not serve as a barrier to health care. By providing identification, consumers will be playing an essential role in supporting the ongoing integrity of the Medicare system. The Government will also empower consumers to protect their own Medicare card information by building public awareness and supporting consumers to access information about how their Medicare card number is used.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One final point worth noting is that this proposal is likely to have a very significant financial impact well into the hundreds of millions of dollars. This would need to be taken into consideration in formally considering any proposal. Labor believes that the case has not been made to support this bill. Labor encourages the government to look at this issue in more detail, particularly as technology changes, ever mindful of protecting Australians' privacy, reducing red-tape burden on health professionals and organisations, and making sure that Medicare fraud is eliminated entirely.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's not to undermine or diminish, effectively, the theme of what Senator Hanson and Senator Roberts are sayingâthat is, that governments must maintain complete vigilance when it comes to protecting Australian taxpayers from fraud and in this case with regard to Medicare payments. But, as we heard from Senator Brown and as I will briefly encapsulate, we believe that the remedies and practices that are currently in place do work and I think there's substantial evidence for that. But I think it is important to put on the record and reiterate that this particular initiative, while it might appear appealing to some in the community, faces some very significant practical difficulties. Those difficulties, I think, reveal themselves when you examine this proposition more closely. They were revealed again in the Shergold report of 2017, which the government responded to in 2019. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At a high level, I just reiterate the government does not support this bill for three primary reasons. Firstly, the likely expense of rolling out the proposed new photo cards would be in the hundreds of millions of dollars. When you're looking at the cost of initiatives like this, it's important to measure that expected cost against the likely benefit. When you measure it against the likely benefit, you can't ignore the success that fraud control initiatives are already having in making sure that payments are going to the right people. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, the government's view is that there is a future potential to skip over photos to an even more secure form of ID such as biometrics, for example. I think this is a very important point: technology is moving at such an effective, efficient rate at the moment that, while you might think that photographs might be a suitable mechanism, it may well be that in future years, in the not-too-distant future, there might be other forms and mechanisms that can do a similar job but with much greater levels of efficiency and accuracy while preserving and protecting people's personal information. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Thirdly, the government's view, as I've alluded to already, is that various measures have already been rolled out to provide similar protections to what the inclusion of a photograph would achieve. So, while Senator Hanson and Senator Roberts have been correct, like coalition senators have been correct, in sensing the constant appetite and constant need for government and agencies of government to be on top of issues around fraud control, we're arguing that things are already being done. We're arguing that the government has a keen eye on these sorts of issues, but the remedy is not what is being proposed in this particular bill. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Before concluding, I think it is important to put on the record a number of key points with regard to this particular issue. There are currently over 25 million people registered on 14 million Medicare cards, with many families sharing cards with children listed on their parents' cards. Inclusion of a photo on Medicare cards would require every individual to have a Medicare card of their own. In addition to that, the Department of Human Services currently takes all allegations of noncompliance seriously, and all reports relating to the potential noncompliance and inappropriate claiming are acted upon in accordance with compliance assessment procedures that are already in place that are constantly being updated. A number of compliance strategies are also in place to eliminate fraudulent activities, including data sharing with other departments and agencies. The Department of Human Services strongly defends the integrity of the healthcare system as it currently operates. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to reflect briefly on the Shergold review, Peter Shergold being the former and very competent and successful Secretary of the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet. In 2017, Professor Shergold led the Independent Review of Health Providers' Access to Medicare Card Numbersâthe Shergold review, as I've referred to itâwhich included as part of its work an investigation of the issue of the current and potential use of Medicare cards as a proof of identity. The Shergold review recognised the need to appropriately balance access to health services for individuals, particularly vulnerable patients. And we heard Senator Brown talk about the impact that this would have on Indigenous people living in remote communities across Australia and the need to balance access to health services for individuals with the security of an individual's information. The final report of the Shergold review states:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Review Panel noted that while adding a photograph or other security feature such as a hologram might have a short term beneficial impact on the illegal reproduction of Medicare cards, such changes are not likely to have a lasting effect.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's a very important point, when you balance that against the hundreds of millions of dollars that have been estimated that it would cost to initiate something that is proposed in this particular private senator's bill. The report continues:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">A more practical and immediate measure is for organisations that accept Medicare cards as evidence of identity to utilise the DVS to confirm that the card and/or number being presented corresponds with a valid and current record held by the Department of Human Services.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The DVS is the Document Verification Service, which is already in operation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Shergold review conducted its activity in 2017. The government responded to that in 2018, and the government's response included four key points. The first was a significant public awareness campaign around the protection of Medicare card details, which was launched in March 2018 and is ongoing, using social media platforms, various front-of-house videos and information on DHS websites, and direct communication with peak sector bodies. The second is that the Department of Health has engaged directly with the sector through peak bodies and sought assurance that providers review their identity guidelines to ensure reasonable steps are taken to confirm the identity of a patient when they are being first treated. The third was that the DHS add additional questions to the phone inquiry line for providers seeking to confirm Medicare card details and also reduce access to this service for providers so that it's used only in exceptional circumstances, such as when delivering services remotely. Finally, the department is also in the process of transitioning all providers to a more secure, digital authentication process for access to our online Medicare card verification services.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The sentiment of the billâwanting to combat fraud in our very broad and extensive welfare payments systemâis to be applauded. The measures contained in this particular bill don't, on close examination, deliver what is a very, very important issueâthat is, that we maintain strong controls to ensure that the payments that Australian governments make on behalf of Australian taxpayers to other people to support a universal health system, like we do with Medicare, are properly resourced and that we avoid instances of fraud. With that, I will conclude my remarks.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator ROBERTS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:03</span>):  As a servant to the people of Queensland and Australia, I rise to discuss the core of this bill, the Human Services Amendment (Photographic Identification and Fraud Prevention) Bill 2019âthat is, providing integrity. And that leads to accountability. Accountability in this parliament is so low, and people right around our country know that. Anybody who goes from this parliament as a representative of the people and listens to the people will find out that the people can cite instances where the accountability is low. Integrity is what it's all about.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As a One Nation senator for Queensland, I know that our supporters have a moral compass and a strong work ethic. So they're annoyedâbecause any lapse in accountability, any lapse in security or any lapse in integrity is paid for by the taxpayer, and the taxpayers are on the hook already for $160 billion worth of welfare. Much of that welfare is necessary: age pensions, Department of Veterans' Affairs pensions and so on. Much of it is necessary, and we are a generous people. We Australians are known for our generosity. We will help mates. We will also help mates around the world who aren't Australians, and that is where the problem comesâbecause of our generosity. We've all heard the saying 'generous to a fault'. We are generous to a fault because we turn a blind eye to the people who are ripping us off. Some of those people, as Senator Hanson mentioned, have come from overseas. They have been here five minutes and are plugging into a system to which they're not entitled.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Through this bill we're looking to provide for the security of taxpayers. That is important. If we don't provide for the security of taxpayers and accountability of government spending of taxpayer moneyâand that's where it comes from: increasingly burdened taxpayersâit will end up undermining the payment of benefits long term. We can pay welfare payments only while the taxpayers are able to fund it. Who pays for government failures? The people pay for government failures. One of our many roles here in parliament is to protect the people's money.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have instances where people have found retribution from Centrelink because Centrelink has made mistakes. Every person, agency and entity makes mistakes. We're not debating that. Centrelink has come back savagely and torn into people. That shows that the system is not working. They don't have the data.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We also see people in this chamber wanting to increase Newstart. That's wonderful, and we support them on many aspects of that. We ourselves want to increase the payment of pensions to married couplesâ$150 per fortnight. It is one of our policies That has an impact on many other pensions. We are about maintaining generosity. We are about maintaining fairnessâthat is fundamental to Australian values and fundamental to One Nationâbut we are also about accountability, responsibility and stopping the rorting.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said, the key word in this bill is 'integrity'. I see a lack of integrity around this parliament. I mentioned it when I was first in the Senate and I mentioned it again at the start of this parliament, the 46th Parliament. Taxpayers are on the hook here and taxpayers lack protection because there is a lack of accountability. Let's have a look at some of the basic economic management in this country. Let's look at the primacy of energy and see if we can find where the integrity is there. You will find there is a lack of integrity in economic management and a lack of integrity in the management of energy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In this country we used to have competitive federalism as a foundation stone to our Constitution. That has been blown to the side and completely ignored. We now have centralisation, and with centralisation comes a lack of competition for managing this country's resources. We now find that we have centralised bureaucracy running what they call a marketâbut it's not a national energy market; it's a national energy racket. It has been so abused. The government itself has admitted that there is now rorting. There is gaming going on. This is just one example of a supposedly transparent scheme where the masses don't benefit directly. The gaming of the national energy market leads to multinationals and large Australian companies rorting the system and driving up the price of electricity. And who pays? The people who use electricity pay. It is now a necessity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition to the national energy market we find that the bureaucracy is now gold plating the networks, so we have people making huge amounts of profit unreasonably, despite the protection that should be there. We have then things like the actual payment rates for retail providers of electricity. In some states they are guaranteed returns of around 26 per cent. Then we have things like the state government in Queensland actually owning the generators on behalf of the taxpayers but privatising them so, instead of it being a department that is accountable to the taxpayers at every election, we now have a corporation with a board of directors. We used to have a system in this country where the focus was on driving down the price of electricity and each state competed with other states to drive down the price of electricity while ensuring reliability. We now have an inherently unreliable system that is mismatched and mismanaged with a hodgepodge of renewables and intermittents coming in. What happens is that in Queensland and in other states, wherever there is a corporatised systemâwhich is the case for the generators in our stateâthe emphasis of the directors is on maximising productivity. That's how they manage and that's how they're held accountable. So, when they maximise their profit, they drive a maximising of electricity pricesâthe complete opposite of the old competitive federalism where we drove down the price of electricity. We used to have an actual market between states and anyâ</span>

                    </a>  That's why I started on the concept of integrity, because that is what goes to the heart of this bill: integrity of our payments to protect taxpayers who are on the hook for everything the government spends now and in the future. We want to cut down the rorting of welfare. We've had Senator Brown talk about if, indeed, fraud is occurring. Hello! Go and talk to the people in the street. They will tell you fraud is occurring. They will give you examples of fraud occurring.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Coming back to energy, what we're seeing there is that the fraud and the lack of integrity is due to government policies under both Liberal and Labor Party governments over the last 30 to 40 years. I can give you specific examples, but, at the risk of upsetting the senators, I won't go into that any further.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's have a look at PFAS, which is hurting the people in Oakey, the people at Richmond, the people at Williamstown and the people of many defence installations and other airports around the country. We are supposed to be protecting our citizens with defence installations. Yet we find the defence installations, through the use and abuse of PFAS, are now hurting not only the lives but the livelihood of citizens, everyday Australians, around this country. I've been listening to the residents of Oakey and how they're so upset, how they've been affected and how their health is suffering. They've been told not to eat produce grown in their own backyards in a western Queensland town, the rural town of Oakeyâgrown in a rich soil, but they've been told not to eat it. That affects the health of these people. The Defence department has been given recommendations from a joint committee that looked into this twice and they're ignoring those fundamental recommendations about health.</span>

                    </a>  We wish to stop rorting. As Senator Hanson has stated herself, a number of people can give us examples of where people have rorted the system, used the same Medicare card repeatedly for many, many people. Having photographic identification would make sure that that would be minimised. Senator Smith himself, in criticising One Nation's proposal, acknowledged that perhaps they will be going even further in the future by looking at holograms and biometric identification. That's very tight, indeed.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are pleased to see that we are at least starting the debate to bring accountability back. That's because, as I keep saying, the people who pay for the undoubted fraud and the people who pay for the lack of integrity are the taxpayers. Our supporters, One Nation voters, have a moral compass and a very strong work ethic. I can give you examples of the lack of integrity, but I will just commend this bill to the parliament. I also seek leave to continue my remarks later.</span>

If passage of legislation is delayed this could risk Australia's international reputation, particularly if the Timorese Government ratifies the Treaty and Australia has not done so. The commercial operators of the affected oil and gas fields may also criticise the Australian Government for the delay and uncertainty around the taxation arrangements. </span>

                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Timor Sea Maritime Boundaries Treaty Consequential Amendments Bill 2019 gives effect to the majority of the 2018 <span style="font-style:italic;">Treaty between Australia and the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste Establishing Their Maritime Boundaries in the Timor Sea. </span>The Treaty is an historic achievement for Australia and Timor-Leste and its implementation is firmly in Australia's national interest. In introducing this bill, the Government recognises the significance of this year, 2019, to the Timorese people. This year marks the twentieth anniversary of the Popular Consultation that led to Timor-Leste's independence, and the beginning of our close security and development partnership. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Treaty will replace the <span style="font-style:italic;">Timor Sea Treaty between the Government of East Timor and the Government of Australia</span>, which established the Joint Petroleum Development Area,<span style="font-style:italic;"></span>and the <span style="font-style:italic;">Agreement between the Government of Australia and the Government of the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste relating to the Unitisation of the Sunrise and Troubadour Fields</span>. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Through this Treaty, Australia and Timor-Leste have settled a long-running dispute over our maritime boundaries, agreed upon a pathway for the development of Greater Sunrise and laid the foundation for a new chapter in our bilateral relations. The Treaty also provides for transitional arrangements to deliver stability and certainty for companies with operations in the Timor Sea; the express purpose being to ensure these companies can continue operations under conditions or terms equivalent to existing arrangements. Although additional taxation legislation is required to give effect to the agreed transitional arrangements, the Australian Government wants to progress this Bill now to demonstrate Australia's commitment to implementing the Treaty. The remaining legislation will be introduced as soon as possible.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Treaty is a landmark for international law and the rules based order. It is the result of the first ever compulsory conciliation under the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Australia and Timor-Leste demonstrated goodwill and preparedness to compromise during negotiations. Both countries, and the independent conciliation commission, recognise the outcome was fair, balanced and consistent with international law.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">
                    <span style="font-style:italic;" />The Bill proposes to give effect to the Treaty by repealing parts of the <span style="font-style:italic;">Petroleum (Timor Sea Treaty) Act 2003</span> and transitioning the area of current joint administration known as the Joint Petroleum Development Area in recognition of Timor-Leste's sovereign jurisdiction. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Seas and Submerged Lands Act 1973 </span>is also amended to establish and define the Greater Sunrise Special Regime Area as an area over which Australia will exercise its rights as a coastal state jointly with Timor-Leste.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill also implements the arrangements for the regulation of petroleum pipelines in areas of foreign continental shelf jurisdiction consistent with the terms of the Treaty by providing for two new 'international offshore areas' for the purposes of the Bayu-Undan pipeline corridor and a potential Greater Sunrise pipeline corridor. The Bill further provides for amendments to affected offshore petroleum titles as a consequence of the Treaty. Necessary consequential amendments to give effect to all of these elements are made to other legislation by this Bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill repeals provisions that gave effect to the superseded Timor Sea Treaty and International Unitisation Agreement, and amends the scheduled areas for the offshore areas of Western Australia, the Northern Territory, and the Territory of Ashmore and Cartier Islands affected by the maritime boundary.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill alters particular offshore petroleum permits and licences which adjoined the western side of the Joint Petroleum Development Area. The effect is to reflect that portions of Australia's continental shelf under titles held by certain Australian titleholders will transition to the continental shelf of Timor-Leste upon entry into force of the Treaty. A consequence of this transition has also seen elements of exploration permit work programs transferred to new Timor-Leste production sharing contracts as agreed in the parallel transitional arrangements negotiations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill gives effect to the Greater Sunrise Special Regime Area, established by Annex B of the Treaty. The purpose of the Greater Sunrise Special Regime is to facilitate the joint development, exploitation and management of petroleum activities in the Greater Sunrise gas fields.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill establishes the legal infrastructure required for the regulation of Greater Sunrise to be transitioned to a Designated Authority that will act on behalf of Australia and Timor-Leste.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Designated Authority will, subject to the approval of the Governance Board for the Greater Sunrise Special Regime, enter into the Greater Sunrise Production Sharing Contract with the Greater Sunrise Contractor. This will be done as soon as practicable following entry into force of the Treaty and under conditions equivalent to the relevant production sharing contracts, and to the legal rights held under the applicable retention leases currently in place in accordance with Article 22 of the Timor Sea Treaty and Article 27 of the International Unitisation Agreement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This Bill also maintains and incorporates the Eastern Greater Sunrise Offshore Area into the Northern Territory offshore area, to ensure the Australian retention leases in the Eastern Greater Sunrise Offshore Area continue uninterrupted until such time as the Greater Sunrise Production Sharing Contract commences. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Offshore Petroleum and Greenhouse Gas Storage Act 2006</span> will continue to apply to these retention leases during this period.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Overall, this Bill fundamentally demonstrates Australia's commitment to a robust, mutually beneficial bilateral relationship with Timor-Leste specifically, and to international law and the rules based order more generally. This Bill lays the foundation for a stronger relationship with Timor-Leste and creates a pathway for the development of Greater Sunrise, the economic benefits of which will be significant, particularly for Timor-Leste. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="e68" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator STERLE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:18</span>):  I rise to make my contribution to the Timor Sea Maritime Boundaries Treaty Consequential Amendments Bill 2019 and associated bills. Just for a bit of background, the Timor Sea Maritime Boundaries Treaty gives effect to a treaty between Australia and our very close neighbour Timor-Leste, recognising extended maritime boundaries for Timor-Leste and making new arrangements for petroleum development and revenues. This one supersedes arrangements made between Timor-Leste and Australia under the Timor Sea Treaty of 2013 and joint arrangements at Timor Gap for the purposes of petroleum development, which is called the JPDAâthe Joint Petroleum Development Area.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the new treaty, petroleum rights move from jointly Australia and Timor-Leste to exclusively Timor-Leste, except in the case of the special regime area. The treaty creates a special regime area across the gas fields known as Sunrise and Troubadour. This is with its own governance and regulatory authority that includes the protection of current Australian petroleum activities. The Greater Sunrise special regime area is a joint venture between Timor-Leste and Australia. Two international areas will be implemented for gas pipeline corridors, and the passenger movement charge amendment bill establishes that there will be no changes to exemptions that apply to the movement of people between our two countries.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government will also introduce legislation to amend the taxation arrangements for companies that operate projects covered by the treaty. As part of the 2018 treaty, Australia provided that no Australian company will be worse off because of the treaty and the legislationâthat commercial operators will continue on conditions or terms equivalent, which is very important. This legislation has not yet been introduced, but the government has shared an exposure draft with us and has provided a departmental briefing. It has indicated that we will need to pass the bill in this sitting period to ratify the treaty, which we're doing now. Currently projects in the Joint Petroleum Development Area are subject to an Australian income tax on 10 per cent of the income and to Timorese tax on the remaining 90 per cent. The Buffalo oilfield project is entirely within Australia's tax jurisdiction. Under the 2018 treaty this income will be entirely within the Timorese jurisdiction, and I think that's good news for the Timorese.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Due to this transition, projects will cease to have Australian assessable income. As such, they may no longer be able to claim deductions for depreciating assets they had invested in. Equivalent deductions are not available under the Timorese income tax system. Similarly, they may not be able to make other deductions or carry forward tax losses. To meet the requirement that these companies not be worse off, this bill will allow these projects to continue to claim deductions. Any future investments after the entry into force of the 2018 treaty will not be deductible in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor warmly welcomed the signing of the historic treaty in March 2018 between Australia and Timor-Leste, establishing their maritime boundaries in the Timor Sea. The treaty brings to an end more than 40 years of uncertainty over our shared maritime border and vindicates the strong position taken by Labor to take decisive steps to settle our dispute with our neighbour Timor-Leste. Labor believes that the maritime boundary dispute with Timor-Leste seriously strained our bilateral relations and that it was in the national interests of both Australia and our dear neighbour to resolve this dispute. We are therefore very pleased that this treaty is the first ever to be achieved by conciliation under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia and Timor-Leste have agreed that from the date the treaty enters into forceâhopefully very soonâTimor-Leste will receive all future upstream revenue derived from petroleum activities from the Kitan oilfield and the Bayu-Undan gas field. Previously both Australia and Timor-Leste received benefits from the revenue derived from petroleum activities in the JPDA, including these two fields. As I said, in addition, Australia and Timor-Leste have agreed that the Buffalo oilfield, which previously fell within the continental shelf of Australia, will now fall within the continental shelf of Timor-Leste and that Timor-Leste will receive all future revenue from that oilfieldâvery good news. The development of the Greater Sunrise fields is expected to yield significant revenue over the life of that project. The divergent revenue estimate of $2 billion to $8 billion is dependent on the terms of the development concept that is still to be agreed, and we're working our way through with Timor-Leste and the Greater Sunrise Joint Venture for the development of the Greater Sunrise fields. The exact financial benefit to Australia will depend upon a range of factors, including this concept as well as the economics of the project and prevailing market prices for oil and gas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This treaty will give Timor enormous amounts of revenueâprobably more than we ever give in foreign aid, and that's no mean statement. It will give them a new source of independence. It is very, very good news for Timor-Leste, and it's very good news for us, because what we are doing today is honouring what we say about our own approach to the international communityâour approach to social justice and our approach to fairness and equality. It's exactly where Australia should be, and we can all collectively be proud of where we've landed with the consideration of these bills. The Senate should note that in the previous parliament these bills were referred to committee, and evidence was provided that the length of time required for a treaty which recognised Timor-Leste's claims to be negotiated and signed had, in some quarters, seriously undermined Australia's international standing. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important that Australia is recognised as a trusted partner by its closest neighbours. The Australian government has had six years to work on the treaty, and now there is timing pressure to pass the bill before the parliament to allow the treaty to come into effect by the 20th anniversary of the Timor-Leste Popular Consultation on 30 August 2019. The treaty enforcement marks 20 years since the Popular Consultation, on 30 August 1990, that led to Timor-Leste's independence. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has also introduced a tax amendment to the treaty bill that ensures no Australian company will be worse off. That's because that's the best thing that needs to be done with this treaty. The treaty demonstrates Australia's commitment to international law and rules, Australia's intention to have robust bilateral relations with Timor-Leste and, seriously, to get the Greater Sunrise gas field developed. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend the legislation to the Senate. It really is a fantastic time for the prosperity of the Timor-Leste people and I wish them all the very best.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator DI NATALE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Australian Greens</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:26</span>):  I rise to speak on the Timor Sea Maritime Boundaries Treaty Consequential Amendments Bill 2019 and related bills. The Greens want to see this bill passed as soon as possible. It is our view that the Timor Sea Maritime Boundaries Treaty must be ratified without further delay, and the passage of these bills is critical to that. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The people of Timor-Leste have been waiting long enough to finally settle with Australia the borders of their nation. They have been waiting long enough for justice. I'd like to think that the ratification of the Timor Sea Maritime Boundaries Treaty signals the beginning of a new and positive bilateral relationship between our two countries, but if that is to happen we must also reflect on, acknowledge and apologise for the wrongs of the past. Prior to the negotiation of this treaty, Australia's behaviour in its relationship with Timor-Leste has been a textbook lesson in how to squander the goodwill of a neighbour and good friend. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the time of Timor-Leste's independence, despite a vexed history, Australia came to Timor's aid. We organised and led the International Force East Timor after their overwhelming vote for independence led to a spiral of violence and the death and displacement of countless Timorese. Ordinary Australians were appalled by the violence that occurred there after the referendum and many contributed financially to humanitarian efforts. Indeed, I was privileged to be able to witness this firsthand. When thousands of East Timorese were evacuated to Darwin, I flew up to Darwin and helped with the assessment, triage and processing of these East Timorese refugees. I'll never forget the look on some of those people's faces, people who were malnourished, many of them hiding in the hills, scared for their lives, some of them sick, all of them deeply traumatised. They were men, women and children who had been through the most horrific period that that nation has endured. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That experience was just one of many thousands of examples of Australians helping their Timorese neighbours as Timor was born a nation. Sadly, that moment in Australia's history, that support we gave to Timor-Leste as their nation was born, is a bright spot in what has been a very dark and troubled history. We know that in the 1970s Gough Whitlam, then the Prime Minister, assented to Indonesian President Suharto's plan to occupy what was then Portuguese Timor. We failed to investigate and hold anyone to account as Australian journalists, the Balibo Five, were murdered by Indonesian security forces, in Timor, in 1975. Indeed, subsequent to the Whitlam prime ministership, according to author Clinton Fernandes, the governments of Malcolm Fraser, Bob Hawke and Paul Keating all cooperated with the Indonesian military and President Suharto to obscure details about conditions in Timor-Leste and to preserve Indonesian control of the region. It seems that, while we may have had some sympathy for the plight of the East Timorese, the relationship with Indonesia was something that would be maintained at all costs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, if that wasn't bad enough, subsequent to Timor-Leste's independence Australia spent much of the next decade undermining our newest neighbour. For the first two decades of this century, successive Australian governments have behaved in a reprehensible way in our maritime boundary dispute with Timor-Leste. These negotiations weren't conducted in good faith. They were more interested in Australia's self-interest than in securing a fair and just outcome. We withdrew recognition of international maritime boundaries, taking billions of dollars of resource revenue that we now agree is not ours and that was taken from Timor in contravention of international legal principles.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Perhaps most shockingly, we spied on East Timor during negotiations, under the guise of an AusAID project. That illegal and unethical spying operation was of course exposed by whistleblower Witness K, who, along with his lawyer, Bernard Collaery, is facing ongoing prosecution from the Australian government. Journalist Bernard Keane has referred to the Witness K prosecution as 'the biggest national security story in a generation'. It's hard to argue with that. It's, in his words: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">â¦ the ongoing cover-up of a crime committed by the Howard government to help a major Australian company, exposed by two patriots with decades of service to Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just think about that: two brave individuals interested in decency, in supporting transparency and in ensuring that justice is done are now being prosecuted by the Australian government. And it was our foreign minister at the time, Alexander Downer, who ordered this illegal spying operation to the benefit of Australian companies, like the fossil fuel behemoth, Woodside. It should surprise no-one that Mr Downer went to work for Woodside as a consultant after leaving office.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's treatment of Witness K and his lawyer is yet another example of Australia inching towards a police state, something that's being enabled by what is a bipartisan consensus that, somehow, if something is called 'national security legislation' it doesn't deserve proper scrutiny. Well, that is failing us. It's failing us big time. We need more transparency. We need to open up national security legislation to all members of this chamber, not to engage in closed inquiries where evidence is given under the cloak of darkness and where draconian laws are signed off on by both the Liberal Party and the Labor Party without any opportunity to question or scrutinise the evidence that has been provided.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When you live in a democracy that spends years prosecuting a whistleblower who exposed illegal spying activity on a much less powerful neighbour and friend during oil negotiations, you know that something is rotten. Once again the Greens urge and implore the government to drop its prosecution of Witness K and his lawyer, Bernard Collaery.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While we welcome the impending ratification of this treaty, we are disappointed that it includes restrictions that prevent Timor from seeking compensation for its loss of revenueâsomething that effectively amounts to theft. The Australian government could return this stolen money. As Timor-Leste civil society organisation La'o Hamutuk notes in its submission to the JSCOT inquiry, Australia should follow through on the principles and values that the treaty promotes and inspires, like cooperation and friendship, and give back the revenue that we took. Sadly, I'm not holding my breath.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me finish by making a heartfelt apology to the people of Timor-Leste for the behaviour of past and current Australian governments. We have ignored you when you needed us most. We have used our might against a small emerging nation to pressure you into accepting unfair deals, even when the revenue from those resources that are rightly yours would have helped you find your feet and lift you out of poverty. As the Uniting Church points out in its submission, this is funding that could have been used to provide schools, health clinics, age care and support for people with disabilities. Having visited East Timor and seen the urgent health needs in that country, the lack of infrastructure and the lack of basic transport infrastructure, that funding could have been used to help that nation develop much more quickly, to lift people out of poverty, to get access to decent health care and for young people to get access to an education. No, the Australian government came to the negotiating table many years too late, after many of the resources in the contested areaâresources that rightly belong to youâhad already been drained. So to the people of Timor-Leste: on behalf of the Australian Greens, I say sorry. May the ratification of this treaty open up a new chapter in both of our nations' histories. We can and must do better.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On that note, I move:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">At the end of the motion, add:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">"but the Senate, in welcoming the ratification of the Timor Sea Maritime Boundaries Treaty, calls upon the Government to apologise to the people of Timor-Leste for the unscrupulous behaviour of successive Australian governments including illegal and unethical spying operations."</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:37</span>):  I want to speak briefly on the Timor Sea Maritime Boundaries Treaty Consequential Amendments Bill 2019 and related bills, which I'm very pleased has made its way now to the Senateânot before time, but it is good that it has now been finalised.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In March 2018, when this treaty was signed, we warmly welcomed it. I made the point at the time that the treaty brought to an end some 40 years of uncertainty over the shared maritime border. I also wish to make the point today that it confirms the strong position taken by the Australian Labor Party to take decisive steps to settle our dispute with Timor-Leste. As has previously been said by Senator Sterle in this debate, but does reflect the public comments both I and Tanya Plibersek have made previously, this was a boundary dispute which strained our bilateral relationship. It was also a dispute which I think was handled in a way that, for some time by the coalition, was not consistent with Australia's principled position and interest based position of support for rules based international order. It was in our national interest to resolve this boundary dispute, just as it was in the interest of Timor-Leste.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I understand this is the first treaty to be achieved by conciliation under the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea, so that is an achievement. It is reassuring that, at a time where longstanding international norms are under pressure, Australia and one of our key regional partners have been able to achieve a treaty that both affirms and advances the rules based international system. If Australia wishes to advocate that other nations play by the rules then so too must we.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The date 30 August marks 20 years since the Popular Consultation that led to Timor-Leste's independence. The lead-up to that event, and Australia's involvement in it, is something which Australians are proud of. Many Australians feel a great affection for Timor-Leste and support its aspirations. I welcome the fact that the legislation will enable the ratification of the treaty. It is vital to the economic future of Timor-Leste. And I welcome the fact that we are doing so in time for the important 20-year anniversary. I know that the parliament of Timor-Leste recently passed the enabling legislation to enable that time frame to be met.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do want to acknowledge everyone whose hard work has got us to this point. I want to acknowledge the many officials, including from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, for their work on this. I want to acknowledge the work of my predecessor in this portfolio, the member for Sydney, Tanya Plibersek. In February 2016 Ms Plibersek as shadow foreign minister committed Labor to working towards reaching a binding international resolution with Timor-Leste in relation to the maritime boundaries. We were the first party of government to do so. It was very disappointing at the time that that announcement and that position that Labor articulated were met with dismissiveness by some in the coalition, particularly Ms Bishop, and criticism. I'm pleased that that attitude did not continue and that the coalition eventually shifted its position to that which was articulated by the Labor Party.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd also make the point that, for Labor people in particular and for many other Australians, the relationship is one of great matter. Both Tanya Plibersek and I visited Timor-Leste over the last two terms in oppositionâMs Plibersek in 2015 and I in 2017. I do remember some very long conversations with Xanana Gusmao about this issue, and I'm pleased that Timor-Leste was able to come to a negotiated agreement on the boundaries. It was disappointing alsoâand I'm pleased that this has now been resolvedâthat, for half a decade, the coalition had no government minister visit Timor-Leste. I think Ms Bishop visited in 2018. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Having said all that, Timor-Leste is an important partner in the region. We have a particular relationship because of our role in supporting Timor-Leste through the Popular Consultation leading to independence. We do have a great many Australians who want to continue supporting Timor-Leste, as I do and as Australian Labor does, not only through these arrangements but also in its aspirations to greater economic strength and greater economic development, and we hope that the ratification of this treaty enables a key pathway to that economic independence.</span>

One of the first things I had to do with the East Timorese was when many families were evacuated because of the Dili massacre. It was an opportunity, I think, for the people of the Northern Territoryâand I just want put this on the record for the Senateâbecause the relationship that we have in the north is enormously critical to the way we behave as a parliament in terms of our relationship with the East Timorese parliament. So it gives me great pleasure to speak on and support these Timor Sea maritime boundaries bills.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Northern Territory has a longstanding and close relationship with East Timor. The Territory represents more than 30 per cent of the total Australian trade with Timor-Leste. The city of Darwin has had an active sister city relationship with Dili since 2003. This is bolstered by strong sporting and cultural links between the Northern Territory and Timor-Leste, with the Northern Territory government consistently supporting mutually beneficial Timorese sporting initiatives. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia works with the government and the people of Timor-Leste to support their priorities and their programs. We assist in three strategic areas: the economy; people; and society. Across all programs, we prioritise improving nutrition, empowering women and girls, and supporting disability inclusive development. The Northern Territory has recently signed a strategic partnership agreement with East Timor. Again, we do this because we acknowledge the wonderful relationship that we have with so many families who call the Northern Territory home. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Timor Sea Maritime Boundaries Treaty Consequential Amendments Bill 2019 gives effect to a treaty between Australia and Timor-Leste, recognising extended maritime boundaries for Timor-Leste and making new arrangements for petroleum development and revenues. I've been fortunate to go to Dili on quite a number of occasions to work with the Working Women's Centre Timor-Leste. That's another important relationship, again, highlighting how the growth and maturity of East Timor and the importance of their reserves and resources filter through the economy and the population to the people. I think it was in 2010 or 2011 when I was in DiliâI'll have to correct the record if I've got that date wrongâand I was actually with the then senator of the Northern Territory, Senator Trish Crossin. Part of that relationship in going to Timor-Leste was to ensure that the women of East Timor could have a voice, a very strong voice, about their relationship with their parliament, and with other parliaments around the world, about matters that impact the women of East Timor. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the big issues at that time was employment and the need for more resourcing for families, for businesses and for the future of a country that even then was still struggling with the infancy of its own governance and direction. So I want to put on the record the importance of the bills at hand and the importance of East Timor to the relationship of not only the Northern Territory but Australia.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:48</span>):  The Timor Sea Maritime Boundaries Treaty Consequential Amendments Bill 2019 and related bills before the Senate today give effect to the Timor Sea Maritime Boundaries Treaty which was signed on 26 March 2018, almost a year and five months ago. After an inexplicably and inexcusably long delay, these bills are now being rushed through parliament so the Prime Minister can visit Timor-Leste on 30 August to participate in the 20th anniversary commemorations of that nation's historic vote for self-determination. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In addition, the Leader of the Opposition indicated in the other place that he isn't asking for these bills to go through any committee process. In fact, he said he was looking forward to travelling to Timor-Leste with the Prime Ministerâthat is apparently what passes for parliamentary scrutiny from the opposition these days. Furthermore, when the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties held its public hearings on this matter, it devoted all of 45 minutes to the Timor treaty from 12.15 to 1.00 pm on 7 May last year. I'll try and do, in the short time available to me, the job that should have been done by this parliament and the major parties and provide an analysis of this treaty and what it might mean for our country and for the people of Timor-Leste. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Firstly, it's worth pointing out that Australia delayed agreeing to a maritime boundary until it had gone pretty much all the way down the road to depleting nearly all of the known oil and gas fields, including Kitan, Buffalo, Elang-Kakatua and Laminaria-Coralina. Now that Australia has collected the revenues, we're willing to share near-empty fields with our impoverished neighbour. How absolutely generous we are as a country! Secondly, article 10 of the treaty says that Timor-Leste shall not 'have a claim for compensation' for money collected by Australia under prior treaties and agreements. The inexcusably long delay, since 6 March last year, amounts to, as I said, nearly 18 months. According to credible estimates by La'o Hamutuk, one of Timor-Leste's finest think tanks, Australia has siphoned off about US$4 million, or about A$5.7 million, per month in revenues from the Bayu-Undan fields and it will continue to do so until the treaty is ratified. This means Australia will take about $100 million in revenues that actually should belong to Timor-Leste. Furthermore, according to the same analysis, under this treaty and its predecessors, the Australian government has collected about US$5 billion from oil and gas fields which it now recognises are in Timor-Leste's territory. That's about twice as much as the 'aid' that the Australian government says it has spent on Timor-Leste. The question around aid is: how much of that aid is actually boomerang aid, spent on salaries and other items that ultimately come back to Australia? I'll have a little bit more to say about aid when I get to regaling the Senate, once again, with the story about how one of our intelligence agencies bugged the Timor-Leste Council of Ministers room to get an unfair bargaining advantage in treaty negotiations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to also point out that the delay in ratification is reminiscent of Australia's conduct during the 2002 Timor Sea Treaty when the Howard government withheld ratification for 10 months until Timor-Leste signed an international unitisation agreement giving Australia 82 per cent of revenues from the Sunrise and Troubadour fields, known collectively as Greater Sunrise. There appears to be a particular pattern in the way Australia conducts relations with Timor-Leste and I don't believe it's overstating it to call Australia's tactics bullying. On that occasion, regarding conduct during the 2002 Timor Sea Treaty, my predecessor from Tasmania in the Senate, Dr Bob Brown, condemned then Prime Minister Howard's actions 'to coerce a poor and weak neighbour, through blackmail, into accepting the agreement'. It's a matter of record that another Tasmanian senator, still sitting in this place, Senator Eric Abetz, then alleged that Dr Brown was casting an aspersion on the Prime Minister and insisted he withdrew his statement. When Senator Brown rightly refused to withdraw that statement, Labor, Liberal and National Party senators voted to suspended him from the Senate for the day. As has happened so often during Bob's career, history has proved him absolutely right. If anything, he understated the point. The Howard government not only bullied its weaker neighbour but ordered the Australian Secret Intelligence Service to spy on the Timorese government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We talk a lot about rules based international order, and this treaty is said to be about our commitment to a rules based international order. So the question needs to be put: how does the Australian government's conduct fit this description? In March 2002, three months before Timor-Leste was to gain formal independent statehood, the Howard government withdrew from the maritime boundary jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice and the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea. Its internal analysis said that there had been no consultation outside the federal government about the decision to withdraw, because public knowledge could lead other countries to begin legal action against Australia in relation to sea boundary delimitation. In plain English, the Australian government knew it didn't have a leg to stand on and wanted to prevent Timor-Leste hauling it before an independent umpire. How is that for a rules based international order?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Fifth, this new Timor Sea treaty hasn't come about because of this government's newly discovered commitment to a rules based order but because Timor-Leste invoked a compulsory conciliation process under UN auspices. The Australian government mounted six objections to the jurisdiction of the conciliation, all of which were found to be completely groundless. That is why we are where we are today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Sixth, neither the government nor the opposition appear in any rush to reverse the March 2002 decision to withdraw from the maritime boundary jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice and the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea. That is unfortunate because that is, in fact, what we should do immediately. We should reverse the March 2002 decision to withdraw. That would show some commitment, however feeble, to a rules based international order. That would actually put our country's money where its mouth is.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to, again, remind the Senate of the fact that the Howard government ordered our external spy agency, ASIS, to obtain clandestine recordings of the Timor-Leste negotiating team's private discussions. The only reason that we know this is because of the bravery and patriotism of two people: Bernard Collaery and someone who is known as Witness K. Many describe Witness K as a whistleblower, but he is a very different kettle of fish to the people who are more commonly described as whistleblowers. Witness K made a protected disclosure to his lawyer, Bernard Collaery, with the approval of the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As we stand here today, both Mr Collaery and Witness K are being prosecuted. I don't intend to breach or intrude into the doctrine of the separation of powers. But, as it happens, their trial hasn't begun yet. It is a matter of public record that the Commonwealth Director of Public Prosecutions is relying on the National Security Information (Criminal and Civil Proceedings) Act 2004 to hold the trial almost entirely in secret. The use of national security to try these men beggars belief.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The National Security Information (Criminal and Civil Proceedings) Act 2004 was passed during the war on terror as part of the measures said to be needed to prosecute terrorists. At the time, then Attorney-General Philip Ruddock referred specifically to ASIO director-general and the protection of classified and security sensitive information as a critical issue in a terrorism trial. The Commonwealth DPP is handling the case through its organised crime and counterterrorism unit. Are we seriously expected to believe that Witness K and Bernard Collaery are potential terrorists? Give us a break.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, there is a real national security aspect to this whole sordid affair. When the Howard government ordered ASIS to spy on Timor-Leste in order to defraud it and to steal its oil and natural gas, there was a war on terror going on, exacerbated by the illegal invasion of Iraq the previous year. At the same time as the espionage operation was underway in September 2004, the Australian Embassy in Jakarta was hit by a car bomb. That was on 9 September 2004. About a dozen people were killed, including an embassy security guard, four Indonesian policeman, a gardener and others. A terrorist group, called Jemaah Islamiyah, claimed responsibility.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the time, the Howard government was assuring the public that it was doing everything it could to protect Australians from terrorism. Its white paper on terrorism, which was over 100 pages long, referred to extremist Muslim terrorism more than 50 times and pointed to the importance of Indonesia around 100 times. Yet, as we now know, the Howard government was diverting precious intelligence resources away from the so-called war on terror and tasking the Australian Secret Intelligence Service to spy on the East Timorese leadership in order to, as I said, defraud them and steal their natural resources.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now Witness K and Mr Collaery are being tried under national security laws. In fact, Mr Collaery and Witness K are national heroes. They are the real reason why the new Timor Sea Treaty had to be renegotiated in the first place. We should remember that, when we hear the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition talk about how this new treaty has brought Australia and Timor-Leste together. It is not this treaty that has brought Australia and Timor-Leste together. It's Mr Collaery and Witness K who are more responsible for that than any others. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The espionage operationâthe bugging of the Timor-Leste cabinet discussionsâoccurred under the cover of an Australia aid program, thereby jeopardising the security of our aid projects everywhere. This whole episode, including who authorised what and who knew about what, should be the subject of an independent inquiry and, arguably, a royal commission. It's probably Australia's biggest intelligence scandal of the past 30 years. That won't happen, because there are people from both major parties still sitting in this place and the other place who will not allow the disinfectant of sunlight to be shone on this sordid affair. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to draw the Senate's attention to the very reasonable points made, in a submission to the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, by Professor Andrew Serdy of the Institute of Maritime Law at the University of Southampton in the UK. Professor Serdy is a former DFAT officer and member of the Australian team that negotiated the 2003 Timor Sea Treaty. He criticises what he calls the disingenuous national interest analysis that accompanied the treaty. He says it has, and I quote from his submission:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">â¦ a number of serious omissions, from which it can be surmised that significant information is being withheld from the document's readership â¦</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That would include the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties. He cautions that JSCOT:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">â¦  should treat with scepticism large parts of the NIA and insist on amendments to the latter that make good the identified omissions, and only then proceed to recommend binding treaty action.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said at the start of my remarks, JSCOT devoted a grand total of 45 minutes to its so-called scrutiny of this treaty. Professor Serdy concluded his submission with this prophetic observation: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">â¦ it would be a betrayal of the purpose of genuine parliamentary scrutiny of treaties that the Committee was created to serve in 1996 if it were content to leave these omissions unaddressed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That is precisely what the major parties in this place have done. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll conclude by adding to the public record an observation. The compulsory conciliation and the resulting treaty have succeeded only in setting the maritime boundary but not the mode of development for Greater Sunrise. As is the case with Bernard Collaery and Witness K, I suspect we haven't heard the last of that matter either.</span>

I would like to say how important Timor-Leste is to my home territory of the Northern Territory. It is our nearest neighbour; it is only a one-hour flight from Darwin. We have had strong cultural, sporting and economic links, going back decadesâin fact, even further back than that, with trading with our Indigenous peoples. I've had the good fortune to travel there on a couple of occasions. It's a wonderful country. It's surrounded by magnificent coral reefs and has warm azure waters, rainforests, mountains and fertile farmlands. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The people themselves are great people. They're amazingly resilient. But they've clearly been beaten time and time again by various foreign nations, including, ashamedly, our own. I've heard many accounts and, in fact, been shown around parts of Dili by people that still today carry bullets from the massacre that occurred there. Whilst they don't harbour resentment towards us, there's great suspicion. But they're willing to give us a chance. They're willing to give us a chance to step up and to do the right thing by them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On 6 March, Australia and Timor-Leste signed an historic treaty, and this is what we are talking about today. It gives clarity on the ownership of maritime resources in the Timor Sea and is important for Timor-Leste's economic future. We need permanent maritime boundaries. It reflects Australia's commitment to their independent sovereignty and economic sustainability. We need to be magnanimous and generous in our dealings with our closest neighbour. Dili is, in fact, a sister city to my home capital of Darwin, and has been since 2003, and shares a special place in our hearts.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The economy of the country is basically subsistence. You will still see fields tilled by ploughs drawn by buffalo, families supported by a few chickens and a couple of goats and coastal communities fishing to feed themselves. There are very rudimentary farming practices. This is their opportunity to reap what's rightly theirs and grow and develop their economy, their lifestyle, their education and is the people's march out of poverty.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The amendments are technical and mostly designed to ensure that existing petroleum operations in the Timor Sea can continue under conditions equivalent, as required by the treaty. This government has consulted closely with the affected companies and with Timor-Leste in drafting the amendments. I commend this to the Senate.</span>

The people we met, both from the Timorese government and the NGO sector, urged us to ratify this treaty without delay. Seven months after our visit and 1Â½ years after the Timor treaty was signed in March 2018, we are finally going to ratify it. I shall say a few words about this delay shortly.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I took the opportunity whilst in Timor-Leste to meet independently with civil society organisations and others that were outside the scope of the planning of DFAT. For example, I met with members of the grassroots civil society group known as the Movement Against the Occupation of the Timor Sea, known by its Tetum acronym, MKOTT. MKOTT is an important player in the Timor-Leste vibrant civil society scene. Their biggest rallies attract as many as 50,000 people, and there is photographic evidence on social media of their strong grassroots support. They expressed their dismay to me about the prosecution of Australian lawyer Bernard Collaery and his client, the former Australian Secret Intelligence Service officer known as Witness K, for allegedly exposing the 2004 bugging of the Timor-Leste cabinet offices, which Senator McKim has talked about. They said that the new treaty has brought our two countries together, but, as Senator McKim suggested, they question why the two individuals, Bernard Collaery and Witness K, who did more than anyone to bring about this state of affairs, are being prosecuted. They called on the Australian government to drop the proceedings.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill, the Timor Sea Maritime Boundaries Treaty Consequential Amendments Bill 2019, and the related bills give effect to the new treaty, and include amendments to Australian tax laws to prevent Australian companies being disadvantaged by changes to the maritime boundaries. The amendments will allow Australian companies to deduct capital expenditure into the future, even though there will be no revenue sources from those areas of investment. The treaty gives recognition to Australian oil and gas company operations in the area. It provides for the establishment of a Greater Sunrise special regime area to be administered jointly by Australia and Timor-Leste. Depending on commodity prices and the precise details of the special regime area, Australia is expected to gain between $2 billion and $8 billion over the life of the resource.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to flag, however, that the mode of development for Greater Sunrise remains unsettled. There remains the potential for tension and disagreement, and we should be alert to that eventuality. In that regard, it's a matter of concern to me that there has been such a long delay between the signing of the treaty and the ratifying of it. But what is of even greater concern is that the treaty and these bills which give effect to it have not been adequately scrutinised. As Senator McKim has said, the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, JSCOT, spent less than an hour on this more than a year ago, and the taxation bill amending our Treasury laws has not been sent to a committee for scrutiny. Moreover, when this treaty was being discussed in the other place, there was very little acknowledgement of the submissions of people and organisations that had contributed to the JSCOT inquiry. That's not the right way to treat people who have taken the trouble to contribute to the legislative process.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A case in point is Professor Andrew Serdyâand we heard Senator McKim also acknowledge himâa former DFAT officer who is an internationally renowned expert on maritime law. He asked why the treaty's accompanying National Interest Analysis does not acknowledge that the decision of the Conciliation Commission in 2016 went against Australia, and to that extent must be regarded as a defeat for Australian policy. He asked why the National Interest Analysis says that:</span>

                    <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-size:10pt;&#xD;&#xA;  ">The Treaty thus cannot avoid prejudicing these former positions; that is its entire purpose.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm sorry to say that this matter was not pursued by JSCOT when it held its 45-minute long 'inquiry' into the treaty. It only called five witnesses: none from civil society, all from government departmentsâJeremy Bruer, James Larsen, Lisa Schofield, Anne Sheehan and Justin Whyatt. Professor Serdy's point about the disingenuousness of the National Interest Analysis wasn't pursued.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I remind the Senate that, with these seven words, 'without prejudice to their respective legal positions', Australia has qualified its ratification of the treaty in terms that leave its options open on the lateral boundaries. The median line was always effectively mandated by international law anyway. We may not have heard the last about this matter. Why was it in there? That was not explored by the committee. Nor did JSCOT follow up on DFAT Chief Legal Officer James Larsen's statement:</span>
                </p>

                    <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-size:10pt;&#xD;&#xA;  ">The treaty contemplates that Timor-Leste will receive future upstream revenue from fields that lie within its exclusive jurisdiction, including the Buffalo, Kitan and Bayu-Undan gas fields.</span>
                  </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That's a snow job, everyone! The truth is that the Buffalo and Kitan fields are almost completely depleted and Bayu-Undan is on its last legs. The truth is that Timor-Leste's future upstream revenue from those fields is pretty weak teaâthe cupboard is bareâbut JSCOT simply let that comment, that assertion, pass.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The treaty also stipulates that there will be no compensation for past exploitation. That means Timor-Leste will never see revenues that rightfully belonged to it had we settled on the medium line from the very start. The relevant background to this is that, back in 1969, the Australian government under Prime Minister Gorton issued five petroleum exploration permits over parts of the seabed that lay closer to what was then Portuguese Timor. Australia didn't have a maritime border with Portuguese Timor. We negotiated a border with Indonesia in 1971 but rebuffed Portugal's interest in these negotiations. We worked with the Indonesians but we shunned the Portuguese.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Prime Minister Gough Whitlam sealed East Timor's fate on 6 September 1974 when he met with Indonesian President Suharto in Yogyakarta. The Australian embassy's briefing advised Whitlam that Australia wanted East Timor to join Indonesia but emphasised this could only occur with the agreement of the Timorese people. The embassy briefing also placed the East Timor question halfway down the agenda for the meeting. Instead, Whitlam opened up the meeting by discussing it as the first order of business. In a grand gesture, he told Suharto that he believed that Indonesia should annex the territory but that it had to pay lip-service to self-determination. 'Obeisance has to be made to self-determination', as documents in the National Archives of Australia show. The interpreter for Whitlam was Australian diplomat Geoff Forrester, a fluent Indonesian speaker. When the meeting ended, Forrester was 'white in the face', according to Jan Arriens, first assistant secretary at the Australian embassy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Indonesia then went on to invade the territory in 1975. During the Indonesian invasion and 24-year occupation, East Timor suffered perhaps the largest loss of life relative to the total population since the Holocaustâ204,000 people dead out of a starting population of 648,000. That's 31 per cent of the population killed. Australia, who had encouraged them to invade, was the only Western country to recognise Indonesian sovereignty over East Timorârecognition that culminated in the Timor Gap Treaty. We traded our integrity because we wanted the oil.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This cynical sort of behaviour sat uncomfortably with the Australian public, however. For them, the outrage of old diggers who had had their lives saved by East Timorese in World War II sounded more credible than the clink of champagne glasses in the flight above the Timor Gap. The deployment of Australian troops to East Timor on 20 September 1999 as part of the International Force East Timor, or INTERFET, was a great opportunity to reset the relationship. I'll say more about INTERFET closer to the 20th anniversary of the deployment in the September sitting period this year. In 1999, when Indonesia withdrew from East Timor, the Howard government took immediate steps to gain an advantage over the country's oil and gas resources. One day before INTERFET arrived, East Timor's leader, Xanana Gusmao, had been released from house arrest in Jakarta and flown to Darwin. In her book <span style="font-style:italic;">Crossing the L</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ine: Australia</span><span style="font-style:italic;">'</span><span style="font-style:italic;">s</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">Secret History </span><span style="font-style:italic;">in the Timor Sea</span>, Kim McGrath reports that Australian officials told Gusmao that it was unsafe to return to East Timor. He and the rest of the East Timorese leadership were first required to meet executives from the oil and gas firm ConocoPhillips. She wrote: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">They were desperate to return to East Timor.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under pressure they signed a statement about petroleum resource development in the Timor Seaâthe first action of the Australian government. McGrath quotes Xanana Gusmao as follows: 'It was like I had been freed from prison to be a hostage. It was only after I signed that letter they said it was safe to go home.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Early in 2002, East Timor had sound legal advice from three experts in international maritime law: Professor Vaughan Lowe of Oxford University, Commander Chris Carelton of the UK Hydrographic Office and Australian barrister Christopher Ward. This advice, arranged by the now deceased Australian activist and medical doctor Andrew MacNaughton, showed that Timor-Leste's maritime boundaries and therefore its oil and gas resources were significantly larger than Australia was alleging. Aware of this advice, what did the Australian government do? The Howard government withdrew from the maritime boundaries jurisdiction of the International Court of Justice and the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea in March 2002. We knew we would lose a legal challenge, so we withdrew from the jurisdiction of those courts to deal with us. When Timor-Leste became an independent state three months later it couldn't exercise its rights in international law. For example, it couldn't go to the International Court of Justice. We should remember that when we talk about a rules based international order. I should point out that this withdrawal has yet to be reversed, a fact that undermines our professed commitment to the rules based international order.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our ruthless treatment of the newly independent state of Timor-Leste had a very serious consequence. It forced the Timorese government to devote enormous energy to securing its economic viability at a time when it had almost no revenue. That robbed it of its ability to focus attention on its myriad of other problems. The country came close to being a failed state in 2006.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As we heard from Senator McKim, the Howard government also ordered the bugging of Timor-Leste's council of minister's meeting room. We now know that that happened, thanks to two Australian heroes Bernard Collaery and a former officer of the Australian Secret Intelligence Service known only as Witness K. I might just announce that I have asked thatâin fact, I won't do that. They're now being prosecuted in a mostly secret trial. Why is this trial secret? As I argued in the chamber in September last year, some secrecy is needed because ASIS officer identities must be kept secretâI accept thatâbut Witness K can give evidence whilst having his identity concealed. There's no suggestion that intelligence techniques or tactics need to be disclosed. There's ample precedence for such an arrangement, as I explained last September in this chamber.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Attorney-General, Christian Porter, has issued certificates under the National Security Information Act 2004 over the brief of evidence. I wonder what the government is trying to hide. Is it the possible misuse of Australia's intelligence agencies during the war on terror, as Senator McKim alluded to? These questions cry out for answers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator McKim talked about people who were still in this building or in and around the traps. That reminded me; I wrote some names down. Chris Moraitis was a negotiator during the bugged negotiations and he's now, of course, the Secretary of the Attorney-General's Department. Dave Sharma, now a new MP, was the PM's adviser at the time. The adviser to Downer at the time was one Mr Josh Frydenberg. One of the people involved in the intelligence agency operation was Nick Warner, now the Director-General of National Intelligence. It turns out, if you engage in these unconscionable activities, you kind of make it to the top.</span>

These observations notwithstanding, I think the treaty should be ratified quickly but we should avoid making one mistake that some in other places have already made.

This bill is to ratify an important treaty that will greatly benefit the people and the nation of Timor-Leste. The second reading amendment moved by Senator Di Natale makes assertions and allegations about national security matters that go to issues unrelated to the bill. Labor is not prepared, I must stress, to support this amendment on this basis and we look forward to the passage of this legislation to ensure that the treaty be ratified in time for the 20th anniversary of the popular consultation.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Chief Government Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:28</span>):  I was happy to indulge Senator Sterle so he could have the opportunity to put the position of the opposition on the record with regard to the second reading amendment that Senator Di Natale, on behalf of the Greens, will move later in the debate. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Much has been said about the importance of this treaty and, Senator Patrick, I did enjoy your contribution and being reminded of the chequered history with regard to Timor-Leste. I would like to, as part of some introductory remarks, reiterate just how important Australia's relationship with Timor-Leste is and to remind people that there are important trade and security investments but they are underpinned by a very, very strong and deepâI'm not quite sure what the word is, but it is a word like 'love' between Australians and the people of Timor-Leste. I think that, when you travel to places like Darwin and across the Kimberley region of Western Australia like I do regularly, you can really feel that sense of warmth and appreciation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My association with Timor-Leste, or East Timor, as it was then, goes back to the early 1990s. I participated in an exchange program that was organised by what was then called the Australian young leaders program. Seven of us from around our country had the opportunity and the real privilege to travel to Indonesia at what was a very exciting time not just in Indonesia's democratic development but in our relationship with Indonesia. As part of that trip, we visited Jakarta, and I had the opportunity to meet and to listen very attentively to the Australian Ambassador to Indonesia at the time, Philip Flood. I'll never forget what Mr Flood said to me and the other delegates on this young political leaders program. He impressed upon us, in a soft voice, the imperative for Australia to pay close attention to Indonesia's need for a strong sense of national unity across that very extensive archipelago of islands. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In hindsight, that makes what has been achieved in Timor-Leste all the more remarkable. When you look at the development of Indonesia, and when you look at the political development of a country like Timor-Leste within that, you can't help but be surprised and impressed by how Indonesian thinking has changed and how Australian thinking has changed. Although Timor-Leste is a tiny and fragile neighbour, I think the path to democracy in Timor-Leste is one that should be constantly supported and constantly encouraged. I often have cause to reflect on what Phillip Flood might say now, when we look at what has happened in Indonesiaâits remarkable progress towards increased democratisation. I'd argue that democracy in Indonesia has brought great stability. For those of us who travel to Indonesia frequently, the maturing of Indonesian democracy has been a stand-out achievement in our region more generally. I'm someone who says that Australia should be constantly deepening its relationship with Timor-Leste, deepening those economic and security ties, and, most importantly and most fundamentally, supporting Timor-Leste's democratic development. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In this morning's contribution, I just want to reiterate the importance of Australia's bilateral relationship with Timor-Leste, and our security and defence cooperation, and reflect on our trade and investment. As would be well known to those people who have made a contribution on this debate already, Australia and Timor-Leste are close neighbours with a shared history and strong people-to-people links. The Australian people have a special affinity with Timor-Leste, as I reflected on earlier, stretching back decades. The maritime boundaries treaty marks a new chapter in our bilateral relationship. While it has been fraught with difficulties, it is a landmark agreement, one that deserves to be supported, and I think it will shape the nature of our relationship into the future. It will revitalise our strong friendship and drive cooperation in the years ahead.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia is, of course, fully committed to the independence, sovereignty and economic sustainability of our near neighbours, and that includes Timor-Leste. Australia remains Timor-Leste's largest development and security partner, with $96.1 million in overseas development aid provided to Timor-Leste in 2017. Australia will continue to support its objective of economic diversification and private sector growth through our development, cooperation and labour mobility schemes. We look forward to partnering with Timor-Leste to develop the Greater Sunrise gas field, which will bring important benefits to both Australia and Timor-Leste.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia will continue to support Timor-Leste's armed forces and national police. We cooperate on regional security issues, including very real challenges around our maritime issues, border security and transnational crime. Australia supports Timor-Leste's ambition to join ASEAN to facilitate its closer economic engagement with South-East Asia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This year, 2019, is a very important year for Timor-Leste. It is the 20th anniversary of Timor-Leste's independence referendum and the subsequent deployment of INTERFET to restore peace and stability. It's 20 years young, the modern democratic country of Timor-Leste. That's something that I think we should find time to celebrate and reflect on, but we should also put our minds to what we can do to ensure that the democratic experience in Timor-Leste is as robust as it can be. Australia looks forward to marking these events, together with our Timorese friends, over the course of the coming year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With regard to security and defence cooperation, Australia has been at the front line in supporting Timor-Leste transition to independence andâas is well-known to this parliamentâled the multinational INTERFET force, which restored security in Timor-Leste following the 1999 post-independence-ballot violence. Australia also led the 2006-2013 International Stabilisation Force, or the ISF, which was comprised of Australian and New Zealand defence forces. The ISF provided security back-up to the United Nations Integrated Mission in Timor-Leste and remained in Timor-Leste at the invitation of the Timorese government for some time after. Australia's defence and police engagement with Timor-Leste continues through the Australian Defence Cooperation Program and the Australian Federal Police's Timor-Leste Police Development Program.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On the important issue of trade and investment, which goes to the core of this treaty agreement, in 2018 two-way merchandise trade between Australia and Timor-Leste was worth just $21 million, so there's definitely room for marked improvement. Australia's exports to Timor-Leste totalled $20 million, and the major export item was passenger motor vehicles. Imports from Timor-Leste totalled around $1 million, made up primarily of coffee. There is, of course, room for growth in this two-way trade merchandise, and the Australian embassy in Dili has targeted initiatives in place to support Australian businesses to take advantage of investment opportunities in Timor-Leste. Australian businesses have found opportunities in construction, logistics, business and financial services, vocational training, consulting, tourism and security. Timor-Leste has had preferential duty-free access and quota-free access to the Australian market since July 2003. Australian development programs are supporting the non-oil private sector in Timor-Leste, including through investments in health, education and governance and through strengthening the business environment. Timor-Leste is the third-largest participant in Australia's Seasonal Worker Program, and remittances are an increasingly significant contribution to Timor-Leste's economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Before I go on to talk about the treaty, I've just been remindedâI'm glad that Senator Brockman is in the chamber with me, because I'm hoping that he'll endorse the comments I'm about to make. To those officials in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade who might be listening to this at the momentâindeed, to officials sitting to the right of meâthere is one particular project in Timor-Leste that I would like us to give closer attention to, and I'm not satisfied with the amount of work that has been done. Senator Brockman, can you guess what that project is? We were just talking about it on the weekend.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Senator DEAN SMITH:</span>
                    </a>  There is this proposition to use Australian aid money to support the development of jetty facilities in the north of the island. Those jetty facilities would support the export of cement, if I recall the project correctly, but not exclusively so. By providing aid to support an infrastructure project like that one, we support not only the development of this particular industry but the economic development of the northern part of Timor-Leste. All of Timor-Leste is in need of important development support, but the northern part of the island, particularly, is in need of support and encouragement with regard to economic development. I'm someone who believes that if we were to provide third-party access to an infrastructure project, like better jetty facilities, that would multiply, if you like, the economic benefit that comes to that particular part of Timor-Leste.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've not had a chance to prosecute this proposition directly with officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. If they're watching this afternoon, it's top of mind for Senator Smith; top of mind for Senator Brockman; top of mind, I suspect, for Senator Reynolds, who is the new defence minister; and top of mind, I suspect, for Melissa Price, the member for Durack, which covers the Kimberley part of our state and the far north-western part of Australia. This is a project that is worthy of attention and worthy of closer examination. If, for whatever reason, it doesn't fit the tight confines of our aid budget, let's explore what more we can be doing to think laterally about how we might be able to give some impetus to what I think is an important infrastructure initiative for Timor-Leste.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Moving back to the items before us, the Timor Sea Maritime Boundaries Treaty Consequential Amendments Bill 2019 and associated bills, I will say some key points in summation. In March of this year, Australia and Timor-Leste signed an historic treaty on permanent maritime boundaries. The treaty was the result of a conciliation process, a process that Senator Wong reflected on earlier in her brief contribution. Under the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, it gives clarity on the ownership of maritime resources in the Timor Sea and is important for Timor-Leste's economic future. It reflects Australia's commitment to the independent sovereignty and economic stability of Timor-Leste and lays important foundations for a new chapter in our bilateral relations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The majority of necessary legislative amendments to implement the treaty were induced in early July and the remaining amendments were introduced this week. The amendments are technical and mostly designed to ensure that existing petroleum operations in the Timor Sea can continue under equivalent conditions, as required by the treaty. The government has consulted closely with the affected companies and with Timor-Leste in drafting these amendments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While the legislation establishes the Greater Sunrise Special Regime, the regulatory and governance framework for managing the development of the resource, a decision on the development of the Greater Sunrise resource itself is not required in advance of bringing this treaty into force. The treaty states that the resource may be processed in either country. Timor-Leste has publicly stated its preference to process the resource onshore in Timor-Leste.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The treaty consists of a number of inextricably linked elements, which are part of the overall agreement, including three key elements: permanent maritime boundaries between Australia and Timor-Leste in the Timor Sea, in recognition of both states' sovereign rights; the creation of Greater Sunrise Special Regime for the joint development, exploitation and management of the Greater Sunrise gas fields; and, finally, transitional arrangements to provide regulatory certainty and continuity for affected oil and gas projects in the Timor Sea. The treaty makes clear that the outcome represents a mutual accommodation, which is without prejudice to either side's legal position.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bills contain various transitional arrangements, but I would just like to reflect on what are some of the revenue implications of the treaty. Firstly, Australia and Timor-Leste have agreed that, from the date the treaty enters into force, Timor-Leste will receive a future upstream revenue derived from the various petroleum leases in the existing Joint Petroleum Development Area. Previously, both Australia and Timor-Leste have received benefits from revenue derived from petroleum activities in this area. Ninety per cent of that benefit has been delivered to Timor-Leste and 10 per cent has been delivered to Australia. Australia and Timor-Leste have also agreed that the Buffalo oil field, which previously fell within the continental shelf of Australia, will fall within the continental shelf of Timor-Leste. Accordingly, Timor-Leste will receive all future revenue from the Buffalo oil field. The detailed financial impacts of this will not be published due to their confidential nature.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As all speakers have reflected, this is an important milestone in the development of our relationship with Timor-Leste. I hope it will be seen as perhaps a turning point for a more harmonious and a more future-driven relationship between ourselves and our Timorese friends, remembering always that we have a very important shared history. Australia has been there at some of the most difficult times, when we think about the democratic development of Timor-Leste, underpinned always by this great affinity that Australians have with our Timorese friends. I'll leave my contributions to that.</span>

I just would like to make this point: the government, including via a number of ministers, has made clear to the opposition the importance of speedy passage of this bill. We have facilitated speedy passage through the House of Representatives. We, today, have truncated our contributions on this debate to enable speedy passage, and the government is now adding speakers to the speakers list. With all due respect to Senator Smith, because he is a well-spoken man who can speak at short notice, it is quite clear that the government is seeking to delay passage of this bill prior to question time. The government owes the parliament, and certainly the opposition, an explanation as to why we were asked by ministers to facilitate passage of this legislation because it was so important and you're now filibustering it. I indicate I will give leave to the minister at the table to explain to the Senate and to the opposition why you're now delaying a bill that you sought urgent passage of.</span>

You know that's not true. We had a speakers list before. Senators Smith, Brockman, Bragg and Scarr were all added. With all due respect, none of you were particularly keen on talking about this previously. The ministers on the other side continue to tell the opposition: 'We want to make sure this is passed quickly.' Why are you delaying it? What's the problem? I simply don't think it's reasonable to seek the courtesy and the facilitation of the opposition for bills that are in the national interest, then realise you've got some scheduling issue and rock up and try to delay passage of it. Do Senator Payne or Senator Canavan want to come down and explain to the parliament why they've had a change of heart, why this is no longer urgent and why they're stacking in backbenchers to pad out the speakers list to two o'clock? I reckon that'd be a pretty courteous thing to do in the circumstances.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="30484" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BROCKMAN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Government Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:51</span>):  I'll ignore the introduction from my fellow senator from Western Australia. This is a very important bill and it reflects a very important relationship in Australia's history. Senator Wong, who courteously listened to my first speech, would know that one of the key issues I wish to focus on in this place is the trade relationships that are so important to us. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst this particular treaty is focused on more than just trade, it is a very significant relationship and one that reflects Timor-Leste's greatest economic assetâI'll restart that: their greatest economic asset is their people, of course. In the oil and gas reserves between our two great nations lies Timor-Leste's most important economic asset and the most important economic link between our two nations. That is fundamental to ensuring that what is a young democracyâa country that is a democracy that Australia played a very significant role in helping to achieve its democratic wishâhas the financial resources to ensure that that nation can grow, develop and become, in the international realm, all it can be. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those oil and gas reserves, particularly, represent the greatest asset of a close neighbour in a region where Australia is a significant economy but where its linkages to its near neighbours are vitally important, both to their future success and to Australia's future success in the region. Those of us on the backbench who do wish to speak on this bill recognise it as being a very important, very fundamental part of the future success of our nation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Timor-Leste is a young nation. Timor-Leste is 20 years old, as my colleague from Western Australia pointed out. Australia played a fundamental role in ensuring that Timor-Leste could achieve its democratic wish. It achieved formal independence only on 20 May 2002. This is the blink of an eye in the history of democracies worldwide and certainly in this region. It represented a fundamental change for that nation. The first democratic legislative elections were held on 30 August 2001. Ninety-one per cent of Timor-Leste's eligible voters played a part in that election. That effectively elected a constituent assembly, provided for under the East Timor constitution. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I wish to talk briefly about the role Australia played in that process, because it was very significant. In fact, we were the frontline of support for Timor-Leste's transition. It came through the UN-run process for the independence referendum. Australia, through the support of INTERFET, restored security to Timor-Leste at a time of great import to that young nation. It enabled the nation to stand itself up. It enabled the nation to put in place the institutions and organs of governance that were required. Nobody around the world would doubtâand none in this place would doubtâthe difficulty of that transition to democracy. We have seen it fail in other places time and time again. The support of Australia through that INTERFET process and then the, perhaps a bit slower but no less important, negotiations over the maritime boundary and over the development of the Greater Sunrise field and the related oil and gas fields between our two nations were a key step in that nation having the financial resources to stand up, to become part of the international community and to take its place as an independent sovereign nation in the global environment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The treaty is historic, and it is vitally important that it does pass through this place. It's a historic agreement for Australia; it's a historic agreement for Timor-Leste. It establishes that permanent maritime boundary between the two countries and a stable framework for resource development in those oil and gas fields between our two nations. Under the treaty, the oil and gas fields in question will transition from joint Australia-Timor-Leste or exclusive Australian jurisdiction to Timor-Leste's exclusive jurisdiction. The treaty provides that the existing petroleum activities will continue under conditions or terms equivalent to the arrangements already in place. Whilst it does not overturn or change those conditions that are in place, it gives a level of certainty and formality to the relationship and to the ongoing work both our nations and the private sector are doing between our two countries.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill also, importantly, gives effect to the tax arrangements required for the treaty to enter into force and fulfils Australia's obligations under that treaty. This matter was looked at by a Senate committee; it went to the Senate Economics Legislation Committee in February 2019. In short, the bill is an important reflection of Australian government policyâbipartisan policyâin this place that will see the treaty implement the boundaries between our two nations, and it also obviously puts in place the passenger movement charge amendment, as required under the treaty obligations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Schedule 1 of the tax bill is important. It amends the tax law to fulfil Australia's taxation related obligations under the treaty and to provide conditions equivalent to participants in the transitioned petroleum activities in the Timor Sea. Under the boundary transition, affected companies cease to generate Australian assembly income and instead generate Timorese income. This disadvantages companies that could no longer be entitled to offset Australian tax assets such as depreciation, deductions or accumulated tax losses against future Australian assessable income, but they will still pay tax on that income in Timor-Leste. The tax law changes will allow affected companies to preserve their tax positions in the Australian system to the extent they will not be recognised in the Timor-Leste system. Obviously this is a very important transition arrangement for the companies involved. Again, the companies involved have invested significant sums of moneyâbillions of dollarsâin developing those resources to the advantage of Timor-Leste and to the advantage of Australia. Ensuring the tax arrangements as we transition to the full treaty is vitally important. The affected companies will be no better off but, importantly, they will be no worse off in terms of the taxation arrangements. There are also consequential amendments that will need to flow through.</span>

Through my colleague, the Minister for Employment, Minister Cash, and through her jobactive services, and also through my area of Disability Employment Servicesâand last week I explained some of the fantastic things that we're doing with disability employmentâthis government is absolutely focused on creating jobs and creating pathways to jobs so thatâ</span>

It actually builds directly on the answer that Senator Ruston gave to the previous question she was asked, which was that this is a job-creating government. We make no apologies for the fact that we believe that the best form of welfare is a job. Since we were elected as a coalition government in 2013 we have set about putting in place the right economic framework so that businesses can prosper, grow and, as Senator Ruston has stated, create more jobs for Australians.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Brockman, in relation to our home state of Western Australia, the most recent labour force figures for June of this year show that employment increased by almost 14,000 jobs. That is a good thing. The economy in WA is creating jobs. I'm also very pleased that in Western Australia we have the very high participation rate of 68.5 per cent. That says that Western Australians are confident in the jobs market. They're putting their hands up and saying, 'We want to participate.'</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We don't shy away from being a job-creating government focused on getting people off welfare and into work. Since we were elected in 2013 the economyâthe businesses out thereâhas created almost 1.4 million jobs. We continue to see jobs growth in Australia. In fact, the June labour force figures show us that total employment in Australia is at a record high, with 12,871,700 Australians employed. We also have record full-time employment. Over 246,000 full-time jobs have been created in the past year. We are a job-creating government.</span>

I say 'opposition benches' because that is where the Labor Party are. They have failed to learn from the most recent election. Australians put their hands up and they voted for jobs. They understood at the 18 May election that the greatest risk to the economy was the Australian Labor Party. They also understood that taking to the election a promise to tax Australians an extra $387 billion is not a job-creating policy. You will recall that they then fought tooth and nail to oppose the tax relief that we have now successfully delivered to the Australian people. We are a job-creating government and we understand that you need to put in place the right economic framework so that businesses can prosper, grow and create more jobs for Australians, and that's what we're doing.</span>

You also need to understand that governments themselves don't create jobs. What governments do is put in place the right economic framework so that businesses can prosper, grow and create more jobs. That is what the role of government is, and this government is doing that successfully. We have a strong economic plan. We want to return, and will returnâunder the leadership of our Minister for Finance, Senator Cormannâthe budget to surplus in 2019-20. That is something that those on the other side have not managed to do since 1989. We know that infrastructure projects create jobs. That is why we have a commitment to a $100 billion infrastructure project. We've passed our tax relief for hardworking Australians because we know it's their money and they deserve to keep more of it.</span>

                  </a>  Mr President, through you, I would note Senator Gallacher's incessant interruptions here. I'm not quite sure whether I should be amused or a bit alarmed at consistent interjectionsâmaybe mildly amused! He might not want to hear this, but this is a great thing for his home state of South Australia. This naval commitmentâit's a $90 billion investmentâstands in stark contrast to the complete, abject failure of Senator Gallacher and all of his colleagues on that side to commission a single Australian-built submarine here in Australia. The attack-class submarine, the centrepiece of this program, will provide Australia with our next regionally superior submarine capability. The security of Australia is paramount to this government. That's why we made the critical decision to protect Australia and its national security by acquiring this capability in an increasingly contested environment.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government also continues to invest in Navy's existing fleet of Collins class submarines to ensure that it remains a potent, fit-for-purpose capability. The six Collins class submarines now incorporate the most advanced technology globally of any conventional submarine. They continue to excel in their operations across our region. Three of the six submarines are consistently available for tasking, with one in short-term maintenance and two in long-term maintenance and upgrades. As we construct 12 new attack-class submarines in South Australia, this government will be putting in place a prudent transition plan, including through-of-life type extensions to the Collins, to ensure the effective operation and the continued operation of our submarine fleet.</span>

On <span style="font-style:italic;">60 Minutes</span> last night, the former Border Force Commissioner Roman Quaedvlieg said 'he was encouraged by several members of parliament, including two ministers, to help fast-track' visas and airport entry into Australia for Crown casino high rollers, including for international gamblers convicted of criminal activity who might not have otherwise even been eligible to apply for an entry visa. Will the Prime Minister name the two ministers implicated? Are they still in cabinet? What is the Prime Minister doing to investigate these serious allegations of ministerial interference to boost the Crown casino?</span>

The Australian government takes allegations of illegal activity very seriously. Everyone is required to abide by the Australian law.

Our law enforcement agencies are working hard to disrupt and deter criminal groups by collecting evidence and intelligence about financially motivated crime.

Does this government plan to progress its weak model or will we see an ICAC with some teeth, and when are we going to see some legislation for an ICAC?</span>

In 1996, the Liberal Party under John Howard decided to destroy farmers' property rights. It did so with the National Party's support. The two parties introduced draconian tree-clearing laws aimed to get Australia's compliance with the UN's Kyoto protocol. The UN's Kyoto protocol was an earlier version of the UN's Paris agreement, designed to reduce the output of harmless carbon dioxide. The human Liberal-National government was unwilling to artificially increase the price of energy to cut industrial CO2 output through climate regulations, so instead decided to remove the rights of farmers to manage their own land. Does the National Party still support the Howard Liberal-Nationals' decision to remove farmers' property rights?</span>

John Howard, with the support of former Queensland Nationals Premier Rob Borbidge and the former NSW Labor Premier Bob Carr, introduced legislated theft of farmers' property rights using the guise of native vegetation protection legislation. These laws stole farmers' property rights. Do you support the removal of farmers' property rights without just terms of compensation?</span>

If you import food, you're legally responsible to import food that's safe to eat. The Imported Food Control Act, together with state and territory legislation, is the government framework that provides assurance to Australians that food sold here is safe, suitable for consumption and compliant with Australian food standards</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Among its many important responsibilities, FSANZ provides the agreed advice on the levels of human health and safety risks posed by some foods. Medium- to high-risk foods are those that may contain harmful natural toxins or pathogenic microorganisms that could lead to food poisoning, if not handled or cooked properly before consumptionâfor example, your steak tartare, your fresh oysters, your uncooked sprouts or your soft cheeses. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">FSANZ provides the important food safety standards that states and territories use to regulate the domestic sale and service of food in Australia. However, it is the Department of Agriculture that's responsible for regulating food imports. All imported foods must firstly comply with Australia's biosecurity imports conditions. For example, we do not accept meat products from countries that we know have African swine fever. While not a food safety concern to humans, an outbreak of ASF would devastate our pork industry. Once my department is assured that biosecurity risks are managed, it uses the FSANZ standards and advice to classify foods for particular inspection regimes under the Imported Foods Inspection Scheme. Recent legislative changes are improving the operation of the scheme, and these include increasing importers' accountability for food safety, improving monitoring and management of new and emerging food safety risks and improving incident responses. The changes help ensure that the scheme can respond to potential risks associated with the growing complexity of globalised food supply chains and increasing consumer demand for imported food.</span>

But I really should be saying thank you to Mr Will Studd, the 'big cheese', for drumming up excitement on 12 July with a tweet: 'Roquefort to be banned in Australia'. Au contraire. It is my pleasure to advise that the rumour is not true. My department is not looking to ban imports of Roquefort, the French king of blue vein cheese. The department is merely carrying out a routine review of the certification arrangements between the Australian and French authorities that allow the import of the raw sheep milk cheese. This is the second review undertaken since 2008, when we began to import the cheese. It is the same review process for all foreign government certification agreements and is consistent with Codex guidelines and processes undertaken by other countries. We importedâand I found this unbelievableâ30 tonnes of Roquefort in 2018. I'm very confident the trade will continue.</span>

My former colleague and self-confessed cheese elitist, Mr Christopher Pyne, has increased the profile of this non-issue in his <span style="font-style:italic;">Advertiser</span> article. He raises his concerns about people consuming the mould that creates the stinking blue-green streaks in Roquefort. I note the mould in question is actually a penicillinâa widespread fungus that's used in most of our blue cheese. It is not the mould that is the food safety risk of Roquefort cheese; as mentioned earlier, it's the raw milk that Rockford is made from. Untreated raw milk can grow Listeria. It's managed the risk, so 'the fixer' can stand down.</span>

I refer to Minister Taylor's claim that a letter from farm organisations dated 3 October 2017 is evidence he was making constituent representations when he sought a meeting with the Department of the Environment and Energy six months later. How can a letter written six months later inform the purpose of the meeting?</span>

Listing medicines on the PBS is a clear sign that the government is on the side of Australians. I am very pleased to inform the Senate that the coalition has invested over $10.6 billion in life-saving and life-changing medicines on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. What that translates down to is: over 2,100 new or amended listings, and we know what those listings will do for the lives of so many Australians. These are listings that actually change livesâin particular, for people who could not afford these drugs if they were not subsidised. Those drugs can cost everyday Australians who so desperately need them hundreds of thousands of dollars each year. To be able to stand up and say as a government we have listed over 2,100 drugs does show we are on the side of Australians. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are currently averaging approximately 31 new or amended listings per month. That is approximately one new drug listed every single day. We will continue to list drugs and invest in medicines that are for the benefit of Australians. For example, in this year alone we've listed a drug like Bavencio. This is a drug for treating metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma. It is a rare and highly aggressive form of skin cancer. If you didn't have that drug listed you probably wouldn't be able to access the drug.</span>

You will have heard the Prime Minister say, time and time again, 'Australians understand the benefits and the dividends provided by a strong economy.' They know, for a government to be able to list a life-saving drug on the PBS, the government just can't pluck the money out of thin air. This government knows that. That is why we are so committed to put in place the right economic framework that enables us to have a strong economy and, ultimately, show that we are on the side of Australians, through dividends and benefits, such as an investment of in excess of $10.6 billion in life-saving and life-changing medicines on our Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.</span>

We understand the benefits of a strong economy. Those on the opposite side don't. And because they don't understand the benefits of a strong economy, Labor, when in government, stopped listing life-changing drugs on the PBS. Why? Because they ran out of money. That is their track record on health. They stopped listing life-saving drugs on the PBS. In fact, in a 2011 budget paper, they said, 'The listing of some medicines will be deferred until fiscal circumstances permit.' You either understand the benefits of a strong economy or you don't, and we are on the side of everyday Australians. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

Pacific nations have identified climate change as the single greatest threat to their security, calling on Australia to do more to reduce its carbon emissions. Minister, you have said that Pacific leaders should be pleased with Australia's action on climate despite rejecting their demand to end coal-powered generation and approving the Adani coalmine, which will be a massive contributor to climate change. With the upcoming Pacific Islands Forum in August, are you still planning on rejecting the demands of Pacific nations for Australia to do more on climate change?</span>

In fact, I was in Fiji at the end of last week for the Pacific Islands Forum's ministerial meetings. The week before that, I was in the Cook Islands to underscore our efforts to deepen the bilateral relationship there. In the previous weeks, I was in Papua New Guinea, in New Caledonia and in New Zealand and meeting with a range of my counterparts across the region.</span>

When we signed on to the Boe declaration in Nauru at the Pacific Islands Forum leaders' meeting last year, we acknowledged the fundamental nature of the challenge that climate change presents to this region. So we are working very closely on a range of initiatives with their counterparts across the region. We are working very hard to demonstrate our commitment through a number of initiatives.</span>

Of course Australia continues to support that process of the development of the Tuvalu meeting, which they are very much looking forward to hosting. They will be holding a roundtable with key leaders and ministers on climate issues on the Monday of the Pacific Island Forum, absolutely acknowledging our commitment in the region to make that contribution.</span>

I would not have believed those reports if I were you, Senator Faruqi, because the position was made quite clear to those who requested the information and was not reportedâin our viewâas it was intended. The strategy is clearly being updated by DFAT to better reflect our international climate change engagement prior to the Paris Agreement coming into effect in 2020, particularly notingâfor those who are obliviousâthat we have just had a federal election. The government wants to take the opportunity to make sure that strategies such as this and other relevant documentation are contemporary and are relevant to the changes in our commitments, which will be seen under the Paris Agreement.</span>

Gerry Hanssen, a member of the Western Australian Liberal Party, has been fined more than $60,000 by the Federal Court for illegally blocking union officials from a building site where a worker had died after falling some 13 floors. Mr Hanssen has also been fined for exploiting foreign workers. Will the Prime Minister now call for Mr Hanssen to be expelled from the party he leads?</span>

I'm not personally aware of ever having solicited or received any donations from Mr Hanssen. But let me make the overall point again: the government condemns all breaches of workplace laws, whether it's by unions, employers or employee groups. Of course, anyone who is guilty of breaching the law should be subject to relevant court action, which is what happened on this occasion. What we are suggestingâand what Labor is obviously fighting against with this line of questioningâis that the courts should have more tools available to deal with consistent breaches of the law by militant unions.</span>

I recognise your longstanding passion to see the development of northern Australia, particularly northern Australia's water resources. You were passionate about that before you came into this place. You will be a great addition to this place and that cause. The government itself is also very passionate about seeing those vast water resources of northern Australia developed. Northern Australia represents about 40 per cent of our nation's continent in terms of landmass but it accounts for 60 per cent, or two million gigalitres, of the rainfall that falls across Australia in any year. Of course, its water resources are largely undeveloped compared to the rest of Australia. CSIRO estimates that up to 17 million hectares could be irrigated in northern Australia. To put that in context: across the whole country right nowâin the Murray-Darling and everywhere elseâwe irrigate only just over two million hectares in any one year. So there is enormous potential in northern Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The federal government, as part of our plan to develop northern Australia, is putting aside $700 million to invest in water infrastructure projects because, when you capture water, you can use it later to create jobs, grow food and help our nation develop. That's why we're putting $176 million towards the Rookwood Weir, which will be the second-biggest piece of water infrastructure in the Fitzroy Basin and help double agricultural production there; $182 million for the Hughenden Irrigation Scheme; and $54 million for the Big Rocks Weir, the first stage of the Hells Gates project. In the election we announced $20 million for more business cases and preconstruction works for the Urannah Dam and the Lakelands Dam as well. There is lots going on here.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also have lots more potential. CSIRO last year did a groundbreaking study for us. It was the first of its kind in the world. More than 100 of its best scientists were looking at frontier catchments in the Mitchell region, Cape York, the Darwin catchment in the Northern Territory and the Fitzroy catchment in Western Australia. They found that 387,000 hectares in just those three catchments could create 15,000 jobs. We're getting on with the job of creating those jobs because we're on the side of developing our water resources.</span>

It is near where I live in Central Queensland. It is a massive project that could help double agricultural production in the Fitzroy catchment. The Fitzroy catchment is the second-largest water catchment in eastern Australia, after the Murray-Darling. It has huge potential to grow and develop. It is great news that last week the Queensland government finally announced some works on this project, announcing a tender for some roads that need to be upgraded around the project. The federal government has had money on the table for Rookwood Weir since 2016. They were first off the rank here. We've had money there for three years now. We were just waiting and waiting and waiting, and now it's starting to drip-feed out to the people of Central Queensland. Maybe the election result had something to do with that. But we're hoping that, soon, we'll see water stored there and the wall pouredâmaybe next year, hopefully, if the dry season holds upâand we'll get a weir there that can create jobs and grow food in Central Queensland for all Australians.</span>

It will help all of our nation, because when parts of our nation develop and grow the rest of the country benefits as well. That's what happened when we built the Snowy hydro scheme: the whole country benefited even though the investment was down there. That's what happened when the Pilbara opened up to iron ore exports in the 1960s and 1970s. The whole nation benefited from that, and the development of northern Australia will also help the whole of Australia benefit and develop too.</span>

That's why we're developing these water resources. It's not about building the dam; it's about building the opportunity that helps all Australians grow and develop and have a more positive future for our country. All of these projects will help do that, and they are only the start, given the vast array of water resources and good quality soils in our north.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">That the Senate take note of the answers given by the Minister for Trade, Tourism and Investment (Senator Birmingham) to questions without notice asked by Senators O'Neill, Bilyk, Wong today relating to ministerial standards.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have to say I don't understand why anyone in this place would waste their political capital on protecting Angus Taylor, because you know what he's busy using his ministerial position to do? To shore his investments up. Instead of getting people's power bills down, what he's doing is spending his time ensuring his investment values are retained. Average wholesale power prices have increased by 158 per cent across the National Electricity Market states since the Liberals' energy crisis began in 2015. Mr Morrison says Mr Taylor has one KPIâto be the minister for lower power prices. But you know what he is? The minister for increasing the value of his own investments.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Angus Taylor failed to declare a direct financial interest in a company, but, worse, he then used his position as a minister to defend that company's interests after it was accused of breaking the law. He met with the Department of the Environment and Energy and the office of the then minister, now Treasurer, in March 2017 to discuss the listing of critically endangered grasslands while the department was investigating the alleged poisoning of the same grasslands on land he part-owned. Magically, coincidently, that meeting occurred the day after federal environment department officials met with Jam Land Pty Ltd, the company in which he has an interest. What a coincidence! And, of course, an officer of the compliance unit of the department responsible for the investigation was present, which Minister Taylor tried to dismiss airily by saying, 'Actually, we didn't talk about it.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Following the meeting, the office of the then minister for the environment asked for advice about whether he could vary the relevant listing against the advice of the Threatened Species Scientific Committee. He asked whether he could act against the committee's advice and whether he could keep the reasons for the variation secret. Again, what a coincidence!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Earlier today, Minister Taylor made a statement in the House which underlined his complete inability to provide any evidence that he was representing anybody other than himself. In fact, as we speak he's probably still failing to answer questions on that topic. He didn't explain why he didn't register his interests. He didn't indicate whether there were any other compliance cases. And he didn't explain what he did in relation to a letter he says he obtained three years ago. Because the facts are these: Minister Taylor says, 'Nothing to see here,' and what does he point to? A letter from three years prior to the meeting which he didn't do anything about, a letter six months after the meeting and a conversation he claims to have had with a bloke from Yass. That's it. But somehow, magically, some 24 hours after his company has a meeting with, or is met with by, the federal department of the environment regarding potential contravention of federal environmental laws, the meeting is arranged. Isn't that incredible! Nothing after 2014. Nothing after the conversation with the bloke from Yass. But the day after the meeting with Jam Land Pty Ltd occurs, magically, Minister Taylor springs into action and Mr Frydenberg's office arranges a meeting. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the same Angus Taylor who has benefited from the watergate scandal, where the government paid $80 million for water rights from a company that Minister Taylor had set up in the Cayman Islandsâhe's a good bloke, this oneâasking departments to meet with him about issues affecting the value of his own investment. The fact is, nothing appears to have been done by this minister, who claims to represent farmers' interests. Nothing appears to have been done to represent the asserted farmers until his own interests were implicated, until his own interests were affected. That's the truth of it. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd encourage any senators who are not intending to support, or are not currently supporting, an inquiry into his actions, to reflect exactly on who and what they're protecting. They're not protecting everyday Australians who are being ignored by Minister Taylor as their power bills go up. They're not protecting everyday Australians who can't pick up the phone to a cabinet colleague to get problems with their investments fixed if they run afoul of the law. If the government doesn't think there's anything to hide, why don't you allow the inquiry to demonstrate that? Why are you fighting so hard to hide it? <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator KIM CARR</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:06</span>):  I'm surprised that the government doesn't seek to defend its position on this. And perhaps, upon reflection, I shouldn't be. I've seen 189 senators come through this chamber in my time here. I've seen some fast and loose footwork undertaken in defence of ministers and attempts to get around the ministerial code of conduct. I've seen governmentsâof all persuasions, I acknowledgeâfaced with difficulties seek to slip and slide when it comes to these basic questions, which the public is, rightfully, concerned about. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These fundamental issues go to issues of corruption, of fundamental accountability and of proper public administration. I have seen governments seek to avoid their responsibilities, particularly when individual ministers have played fast and loose with the truth. But I have not seen examples like this one, where a junior minister will approach a colleague to organise a briefing on the basis that he's claiming to act for constituents, in a neighbouring electorate, on matters where he claims he's got correspondenceâthree years old and on which he's done nothing aboutâand say, 'On technical matters, the only compliance matter that's before the department, at the moment'ânamely, his own company; he claims that this is the purpose by which he is appearing to get a technical briefing. He then, when pushed on this matter, suggests that he's got further correspondence, which is dated six months after the event, in an attempt to pull the wool over the eyes of some senators in this chamber. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Following that meeting, the senior minister, the Minister for the Environment, undertakes to get further advice about where he could act 'secretly'âI emphasise that word because that's what appears in the documentsâto weaken the federal protection standards for grasslands, which are affected by the compliance measure that's being taken against the junior minister's company. Why shouldn't there be concern expressed about any of that?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What we have here is a situation where a junior minister, Minister Taylor, says he has no association with the company, Jam Land, that he in fact partly owns. He then said, 'It's covered by my pecuniary interest statement,' except that it's not. He's met the technical requirements except the main details. He then says, 'Of course I'm going to talk to the department on other matters,' except a compliance officer is present in the room. Furthermore, further action is taken to change the regulations, which would allow a review to be undertaken, used to further delay the listing of those areas that have been subject to the compliance actionâall done in secret and all done at the request of the junior minister seeking this private briefing. I think there are grounds for an inquiry into that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Senator Hanson and One Nation, I'm told, are having some difficulty in coming to terms with this. When I went through Queensland in the last election I noticed billboards that said, 'I have the guts to say what people are thinking'. This was the pitch that One Nation put to the people of Queensland. Well, I know what the people of Australia are thinking about this type of behaviour. If One Nation had the guts to say what people are thinking, they'd vote for an inquiry to get to the bottom of these matters and uphold these ministerial standards that most governments say they are actually committed to. This is a government that says it is interested; it should demonstrate it. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McDONALD</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:11</span>):  I'm new to this place and I've heard a lot of talk this afternoon about people's concern, but I can tell you that I am now wildly concerned, because it seems that there are those on the other side who think that there is only one farmer in Australia. The big sheep at Goulburn, the home of the Big Merino, surely would be an indication that there is more than one farmer in this region.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I just want to read a little bit of the statement from the minister this morning saying:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">There has been strong antagonism expressed by the farming community about federal and state native vegetation regulation for some time. The concern was very serious. The revised listing requires farmers to assess whether there is 50 per cent native vegetation down to parcels of one-10th of a hectare, at highly unfavourable times of year because clover, an introduced species, must be excluded from the assessment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">â¦Â Â Â â¦Â Â Â â¦</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It goes well beyond New South Wales regulations and is costly and unmanageable, as it is difficult or impossible to be sure that routine pasture improvement or weed management is compliant. Ultimately, the revised listing would halt pasture improvement and efficient weed control across the Southern Tablelands and Monaro. It has the potential to do untold damage to agricultural productivity throughout the region, undermining the livelihoods of many of the 2Â½ thousand people who work in agriculture in my electorate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's what I want to speak about: the regulation, particularly around vegetation, is making it almost impossible for farmers, particularly in Queensland, who, under the state Labor government, have been strangled by red tape and regulation, to manage the land that they're expected to manage. The state Labor government have introduced regulation that is difficult to manage, and the department will not answer questions on what practices farmers are able to use.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This place should be representative of all parts of Australia. Again, I am terrifically concerned that there are only a few of us here who understand the impost and the impact of regulation on vegetation on the most important people in the countryâthose people who are growing food and fibre for Australians and for a good part of the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The recent bushfires in Queensland were a horrific example of what happens when regulation and green tape go berserk. We were very, very fortunate that no person died in those bushfires, but I can tell you that plenty of animals, plenty of old-growth trees and plenty of native forests died as a result of regulation that didn't allow normal farm management practices to happen. Australian agricultural lands have been managed for tens of thousands of years by our First Nations people and now by landholders. Those normal practices of fire management were not allowed to be used, and this resulted in untold damage. I think it is very important that people be able to make representations to manage regulation that is not allowing good land management practices to happen.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:15</span>):  I say as the duty senator for the seat of Hume that the people of Hume deserve so much better than what they're getting from Angus Taylor. I can tell you, from visiting that electorate many, many times and meeting with farmers myself, that the access that this minister has sought for properties that are of interest to him and his family, in terms of a direct benefit to him, is an extraordinary abuse of the position which the people of Hume have bestowed on him. The best thing you can do if you're a member of the citizenry of the great seat of Hume is find a way to be related to be Angus Taylor, because it seems to me he is able to get access to the information that he wants, access to the services that he wants and access to compliance officers at meetings that he wants, with regard to how he manages his land, and he does it in his own self-interest in a way that other farmers working that land in the seat of Hume are unable to doâbecause Mr Taylor expects privilege. Mr Taylor has exercised privilege in his own interest in the way in which Senator Wong and Senator Carr have outlined here. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Taylor, you'd have to say, has been extremely evasive in answering the questions that we have been asking. His statement this morning is what Minister Birmingham, under the tutelage of the Leader of the Government here in the Senate, stood behind today, referring the Senate to 'Mr Taylor's statement'. Mr Taylor's statement is not worth the paper it's written on, because we have found, day after day, that Mr Taylor is doing anything but telling the truth clearly and cleanly to the Australian people and to the people in the seat of Hume about exactly what's going on. He has been involved, in recent months, in that outrageous case of 'watergate', with $80 million involved. People were outraged then. People in the seat of Hume were outraged to find out that, for a local forum in the middle of the election period, Mr Taylor was given access to questions on local matters that would be asked, for which he had prepared speaking notes done for him by his office. The people against whom he was debating, participating in a democratic process, were not given those questions till hours after Mr Taylor and certainly didn't have the benefit of prepared answers done by staff. Mr Taylor is used to advantage, and that's why he has taken the steps that are on the record with regard to the grasslands that are owned by a family company that he jointly ownsâwith one-third of the sharesâcalled Jam Land.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What I think is extraordinary is the scale of the snow job which Mr Taylor has determined he has the capacity to do on the entire Australian population, this Senate and the House of Representatives. Just last Thursday, Labor were so concerned about Mr Taylor's attempt at a layer cake of deception that we tried to get up a Senate inquiry. The way in which Mr Taylor and the government avoided that getting a positive vote here in the Senate last Thursday was to provide some documentation to some members of the crossbench. Sadly, they didn't act quite deceptively enough, and the reality is the dates on those letters reveal that a letter on which they relied to get crossbench support, to hide this from the public and to avoid the scrutiny of a Senate inquiry, was dated seven months after the date on which this incident occurred. So, Mr Taylor is relying now on a letter dated well after the event in which he sought to intervene, in his own personal interests, and he's also relying on comments from members of an adjoining seat, the seat of Eden-Monaro, and from a commentary that he says is a conversation he had with a farmer in Yass.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are many good farmers in Yass, but not all of them have access to the offices of Mr Frydenberg. There are many good farmers in Yass and Goulburn who want to do the right thing, who are doing the right thing, who are farming properly and who deserve far better representation than this minister. He could not get exercised about anything with regard to these particular grasslands and the management of those grasslands until he received notification that it was going to affect him personally. Now, that is a lazy member. That is a deceptive member. That is a member who deserves the scrutiny of this Senate. And this afternoon, when a motion is presented to provide that scrutiny, the crossbench in this place should support it, because Mr Taylor does not deserve the support of the colleagues who are standing up for himâ <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:20</span>):  First of all, in taking note of relevant responses today, may I say that we've had a clear statement in this place from Minister Birmingham regarding Minister Taylor's requirements within the statement of ministerial standards, and I thank the honourable senator for his contribution. But let me be clear: what we have here today is just another parliamentary tactic by the Labor Party to distract from the fact that this government is delivering on its agenda. And why do they want to distract us? Because the Labor Party are in absolute disarray because they lost the election and almost two months later can't work out where it all went wrong.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And why did Australians reject Labor's policy platform on 18 May? Was it option Aâtheir pledge to wage class warfare? Was it option Bâtheir plan to introduce higher taxes on hardworking Australians? Was it option Câa reckless spending agenda? Or was it in fact option Dâall of the above? Certainly during the election campaign and since then, through my conversations with hardworking Tasmanians in my own state, it has been abundantly clear to me that Labor's policy platformâa platform to tax, a platform to punish, a platform to curb the ways in which everyday Australians live their livesâis not one that appeals. Australians didn't like what they saw from Labor on 18 May, and they still don't like what they see, although at least in the lead-up to election day it looked like Labor actually stood for somethingâsomething that was resoundingly rejected by voters, but still something. Now they stand for nothing except for playing political games in this parliament, continually asking the same questions, even though they know the answer, and petulantly opposing our government's mandate. Today's question regarding Minister Taylor is just one of these examples.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One thing is for certain, and that is that until Labor manages to form some sort of agendaâI have very low expectations of that occurringâthis Labor opposition will continue to play games in parliament. In contrast, the Morrison coalition government are focused on getting on with the job and doing what's right by the Australian people, keeping our promises and getting on with our job of governing. We don't need to revert to parliamentary tactics and time-wasting exercisesâ</span>

                  </a>  I restate: in taking note of the responses today, I can't help but reflect on how this chamber's time would be better spent asking and answering questions about this government's plan to make life better for everyday Australians. As I said, that is what mature, grown-up governments do, and we're getting on with the job. We've delivered tax relief for 10 million working Australians, and we've backed in our farmers with our drought relief fund. We're dealing with foreign terrorist fighters who are trying to come back to our country, with our tough new temporary exclusion orders to keep Australians secure. We're helping our hardworking families and our farmers by progressing legislation to outlaw the activists who are invading our farms. We're giving more power and greater flexibility to the courts to deregister law-breaking unions and take action against certain militant parts of unions and their officials.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On every issue, at every turn, Labor has tried to oppose and block our agenda and play these political games, and they've been rightly called outâin fact, pilloriedâfor trying to play these games with pieces of legislation that not only were supported by voters at the election but are commonsense, practical policies to make life better for everyday Australians. What we are seeing from them today is just a continuation of this counterproductive behaviour. These games, these time wasting, unnecessary parliamentary tactics, are not what Australians voted for. Everyday Australians voted for a grown-up government that gets the job done. Everyday Australians resoundingly endorsed a government that keeps our economy strong and our future secure. That is what Australians voted for, and that is what this coalition government is setting out to do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In stark contrast, now we have a situation where Labor, clearly, doesn't want to talk about policies anymore, so instead they are going to play the man. Why would Labor stop giving Australians a tax cut? Why would Labor oppose locking in funding for our drought-affected communities? Why would Labor oppose legislation which seeks to ensure unions and union officials act within the law? Those are the questions that have Australians wondering what on earth Labor have been doing since the election. Whose side are they on? Whose side is Labor on? Are they are on the side of hardworking Australians who deserve tax relief and who deserve to have their next generations employable and appropriately trained for the jobs of the future? Whose side is the Labor Party on, because it is clearly not the side of everyday Australians?</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Pacific nations have repeatedly identified climate change as the single greatest threat to their security. For decades they have been calling on Australia to do more to reduce its carbon emissions. Over the last few weeks, the foreign minister has had multiple opportunities to address the demands by Pacific Island nations to act on climate change but has refused to do so. Instead, Australia has told the leaders of Pacific Island nations that they should be pleased with Australia's efforts. What should they be pleased with, Minister? The fact that your government approved the Adani coalmine, which will be a massive contributor to climate change, or the fact that the capital of Australia's export credit agency, Efic, has increased sixfold with the clear mandate to pursue Australian interests with no regards to our neighbours? We know what this means: unfettered access to taxpayer money to fast-track fossil fuel projects in the region. This undermines the climate action on which the safety of the Pacific depends. This is really a slap in the face to our Pacific neighbours, who have urged us, time and time again, to wean ourselves off coal and our addiction to climate pollution.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Minister Payne was in Fiji just last week conducting meetings behind closed doors to make sure, as <span style="font-style:italic;">The Australian</span> reported, that there is no climate stoush at the upcoming Pacific Islands Forum. Shamefully, Australia is bringing nothing to the table at the forum to address this existential threat posed by the climate breakdown, to our Pacific Island neighbours.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia's real interests in the Pacific have been exposed time and again, with successive governments looking to continue an extractive relationship with our neighbours. The government's decision to approve the Adani coalmine and their ever increasing export of coal and gasâwith the emissions from this having doubled since 2000, and now more than double our domestic emissionsâmakes us a bully in the region, pushing ahead with an agenda dictated by the fossil fuel lobby and others who profiteer from the death of our planet. This agenda condemns our neighbours in the Pacific to rising sea levels and dislocation, to severe storms and to a loss of arable land and drinking water.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Coal is the leading contributor to global climate change, and Australia, sadly, is the biggest exporter of coal. Eighty per cent of the coal that is dug up in Australia is shipped overseas to be burned, making Australia an international pariah and one of the biggest contributors to the growing climate emergency. It is Australia's addiction to coal and the bipartisan commitment to taking donations from the fossil fuel industry that have made sure we continue to relentlessly pursue this agenda. There is no way we will achieve the Paris Agreement targets under this government's present trajectory. The minister has also been sitting on the strategy for climate change in our aid program prepared by DFAT. The draft has been on her desk for more than six months now. This shows how little attention climate change gets in our overseas aid program with this government at the helm.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the region's leading contributor to dirty emissions and a major fossil fuel exporter, it is our responsibility to do more. A just foreign aid program would not look like a checked-box exercise, where there is hardly any funding and practically no focus on climate change and resilience. Climate justice would mean that we drastically cut our emissions. It would mean a huge investment in climate-resilient infrastructure in the Pacific region. Through our overseas aid and international development program, we should be doing much more to support climate resilience in our Pacific neighbours. Pacific islanders are at the front line of change, and that is caused by global countries like Australia who have failed to curb their emissions, who have failed to rein in their addiction to burning and exporting fossil fuels and, lastly, who have failed in their obligation to be a good global citizen. It is not the fault of Pacific island nations that they find themselves faced with rising sea levels. We know that developing countries have contributed very little to global warming and climate change but now face some of the worst consequences. Our aid program should reflect this debt. It is a matter of global justice. We owe it to our Pacific Islands nations and the world.</span>

                  </a>  This is an important motion that really goes to the heart of expert advice from frontline service providers in the family and domestic violence space; from our lead national researcher, Australia's National Research Organisation for Women's Safety, ANROWS; and from Australian Women Against Violence Alliance, AWAVA, one of the lead women's advocacy bodies. They are begging the government to not require couples counselling where there have been recorded incidents of domestic violence. Frontline services desperately need more funding. However, to allocate funding for forced or even optional couples counselling in instances of violence in a relationship, where other services are struggling for funding is against the advice of these expert bodies. It's clear that we need trained experts to be providing services, not faith based organisations to be requiring couples counselling, which is what the government's criteria provide for.</span>

                  </a>  This motion is misleading. The government is funding an expansion of specialised family violence services primarily to provide additional services for children who witness or experience violence. Specialist family violence services do not force survivors to undergo counselling with perpetrators, and all funded services must be delivered in accordance with the National Outcome Standards for Perpetrator Interventions. The government believes it should provide a wide range of services to encourage women to come forward to access the support that is their right. The Morrison government has committed a record $328 million for prevention and frontline services under the Fourth Action Plan of the National Plan to Reduce Violence against Women and their Children; we do not require couples counselling.</span>

On the other hand, they gave $110 million to the pokies. The Liberals say pokies create jobs. You know what pokies really create? They create absolute pain and misery. People are committing suicide because of these machines. These machines suck the life out of the local communities and they are sucking the life out of Tasmania. Nobody wins from these machines except the people who own them and the people who take political donations from the people who own them. They win big by selling a product that hooks you in and bleeds you dry. Half the money these machines pull in comes from problem gamblers. It's a business model built on the abuse of the most vulnerable in our society. It's absolutely robbery and it's absolutely shameful. I support this motion because pokies are a curse. The sooner they are removed from our pubs and clubs, the better.</span>

                    </a>  We know that the role of the Senate is to inquire on issues that are of international significance, national significance and local significance. We've read the terms of reference, and they are broad enough for us to be confident that this inquiry could be used for a constructive purpose. But, given the nature of the language in these terms of reference, and given some of the voices in this place who have clearly expressed negative sentiment towards immigrants and who clearly do not support multiculturalism, we are also concerned that this committee inquiry has the potential to be used for purposes that we don't support. We are prepared to accept that it is our role to inquire into issues like this, and we'll give the benefit of the doubt to Senators Carr and Stoker, who have moved this. But we will be watching very closely that this doesn't become a vehicle for people who have, quite frankly, racist and bigoted views.</span>

We note particularly the UN's Kyoto protocol, the UN's Paris agreement, the UN's Rio declaration from 1992, and the UN's Lima agreement, which was both signed by Gough Whitlam in 1975 and ratified by Malcolm Fraser in 1976. We also note that property rights are fundamental to freedomâand I'm looking particularly at the Liberal and National partiesâand I would hope that these matters would be considered by this committee, but we do support the inquiry.</span>

                  </a>  I rise in support of the motion. The PFAS group of chemicals build up in the human body and in the environment over time. The US EPA and the German government have found high levels of PFAS are toxic for reproduction and development of the human fetus, with probable links to serious conditions, including testicular and kidney cancer. PFAS contamination has been found at RAAF Williamtown, Oakey, Richmond, Edinburgh, East Sale and Townsville. </span>

Residents can be contaminated from drinking the water, coming into contact with the soil or eating food grown or raised in their own soil in these so-called red zones. Residents around some of these bases have elevated levels of PFAS in their blood. The residents are living a nightmare, not just worrying about their own health and the health of their kids but trapped in houses that they can't sell. I support Senator Faruqi's motion and call on the government to maintain its promise to the people of Oakey, to release this report and to get on with fixing the mess. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    </a>  I take the senator's contribution that Minister Taylor has tabled relevant documents. If that's the case, then there's a three-year-old letter that he's relying on as the basis for his meeting three years later, and there's a letter that was sent six months after the meeting in question. If they are the only relevant documents, then I'm afraid Minister Taylor has really shot himself in the foot by demonstrating that, in fact, there was no constituent correspondence to justify him meeting with then environment Minister Frydenberg, apparently on the basis of constituent concern. </span>

We want to see this so-called correspondence. If it really is only a letter that was sent to him three years prior and a letter that was sent to him six months after, then what a coincidence that a day after he was sued for breaching environmental laws he sought a meeting as a cabinet minister with his fellow cabinet minister. I urge the chamber to support this OPD.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator GRIFF</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:18</span>):  Today I speak about an insidious, serious public health problem. It is one which will have lifelong consequences for those with the condition, and it impacts almost every part of our community in some way. But it is entirely preventable. I'm talking about fetal alcohol spectrum disorder, or FASD for short. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">FASD is an umbrella term for a range of physical, mental, developmental and behavioural problems suffered by a child whose mother drinks alcohol while pregnant. FASD has no cure. It can be severe or it can be mild. The baby can often seem healthy at birth, and only a minority of babies will have telltale facial deformities that can form when their mother drinks in the first trimester only. Babies born with FASD might look healthy but the wiring in their brain will be scrambled. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They are destined to have varying problems with memory, learning, impulse control and understanding consequences. They may struggle with emotional regulation, and struggle to plan and organise themselves. They may have difficulty with speech and language, and they might even have sight and hearing problems. In the worst cases, the baby will, tragically, be robbed of the ability to realise their full potential simply because their mum drank while pregnant.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I do want to stress I do not say this with any blame. Often this drinking is done in ignorance or because of peer pressure from a partner or others close to the woman. Research shows us that one in four pregnant women in Australia continue to drink alcohol after they have learned they are pregnantâone in four. Many of them are well educated too, but they're not educated about the effects of FASD. Usually, they don't know about the risks of drinking while pregnant, or they are misinformed about the risks because they received outdated advice from well-meaning friends and relatives, or even, incredibly, from medical professionals. Australia desperately needs a national information campaign to tell women and their loved ones the dangers of alcohol during pregnancy. If we want women to stop drinking during pregnancy, we all need to empower them to make this safe and necessary choice. The entire community needs to be informed of the dangers so we can collectively support the women in our lives. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are still learning a lot about this disease. The fact that one in four women drink during pregnancy doesn't mean one in four babies are born with FASD. It seemed genetics may play a part in who is impacted and how severely, and the condition is more severe in children whose mothers are sustained and heavy drinkers. Estimates are that FASD affects up to five per cent of the Australian population. The important thing to remember is that, when a pregnant woman drinks, her baby also drinks. In fact, the developing baby will have the same blood alcohol level she does; it might even be higher because the baby's developing liver will struggle to process the alcohol. The alcohol crosses the placenta and enters the baby's blood, where it can damage the developing brain and other organs. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The consequences for affected children are lifelong. Again, there is no cure for FASD. Most children who are later diagnosed with FASD might seem utterly normal when born. Most will have a normal IQ. It won't be until that little boy or girl starts school and starts falling behind and gets into trouble for being disruptive and for not completing their work that the truth of their condition will start to emerge. Even then, their FASD may be mistaken for naughtiness, or misdiagnosed, meaning they won't always get the help that they desperately need. Without intervention, they will struggle to finish school and will be more familiar with truancy, suspension and expulsion than with good grades. Through no fault of their own, children with FASD will quite likely have poorer life outcomes than other children. They will struggle more than others with unemployment, homelessness, mental health issues, and alcohol and drug abuse. They are disproportionately represented in the criminal justice system. A 2018 study found that 36 per cent of juveniles in detention in Western Australia had FASD. Think about that for a moment. What would the criminal justice system look like if we managed to dramatically cut the number of children born with FASD?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is why I'll be proposing a wide-ranging inquiry into FASD, to pick up on the good work done by the 2012 House of Representatives inquiry into FASD and go further, to look at what the research now tells us; the awareness and handling of FASD in schools and the criminal justice system; the prevalence of FASD in vulnerable populations, such as children in state care; and world's best practice in diagnosis, intervention and prevention. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As it is, FASD costs Australia an estimated $1.18 billion every year. Despite this massive burden on our communities, the government is not doing anywhere near enough to combat this issue. It is tinkering around the edges at most and, actually, its actions are really quite inadequate. Its national FASD Strategic Action Plan follows a recommendation from the 2012 inquiry that was appropriately titled <span style="font-style:italic;">FASD</span><span style="font-style:italic;">: t</span><span style="font-style:italic;">he hidden harm</span>. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The 10-year strategic action plan on FASD sounds good, but it is currently being funded with peanutsâjust $7 million over two years to tackle a public health issue which is entirely preventable and yet has such a widespread impact on individuals and society. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A three-year FASD clinical network to support diagnosis and data collection was funded with just $10 million. All up, the government has spent a measly $20 million on FASD since 2014. The efforts have been so paltry that the alcohol industry's own lobby, DrinkWise, has been granted federal funding to promote awareness about drinking in pregnancy. This was such a stuff-up last year that thousands of posters destined for GP offices had to be recalled after the AMA complained because the messaging was inaccurate and misleading. The recalled posters actually stated:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It's not known if alcohol is safe to drink when you are pregnant. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But it is known: it is not safe. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The DrinkWise posters are limp-wristed at best. The messages include:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">It's safest not to drink while pregnant. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Note the word 'alcohol' isn't used. And what do they mean by 'safest'? Is there some sliding scale of safe drinking that we don't know about? Then there is the confusing message: 'When mum drinks, the baby drinks.' That doesn't tell the woman anything about the lasting harm alcohol causes and it leaves it open for people to assume that, if mum doesn't suffer any lasting harm for a night of drinking, maybe the baby doesn't either. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the danger of leaving awareness campaigns in the hands of vested interests. If we want to tackle FASD, the messaging has to be clear. It has to be uncompromising. The Foundation for Alcohol Research and Education puts the message this way: </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to treat FASD with much more urgency. I think we should treat it as a national health emergency. How many of us have heard someone say, 'It doesn't matter if you have an occasional drink in the third trimester because the baby is already cooked or finished baking'? As long as there are men and women, and health professionals for that matter, who still think it is okay to drink during pregnancy, it means there is serious work to be done. As long as this type of attitude exists, it means that we are failing to tackle this invisible but entirely avoidable scourge.</span>

It is a very significant issue in the Australian community and one that all sides of politics, all parts of this chamber, would certainly acknowledge as such. I certainly agree with Senator Griff that it is an absolutely tragic set of circumstances and an issue that society as a whole needs to get a lot better at tackling. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One thing I perhaps would be very interested in finding outâand I had a quick attempt earlier today to try and find this information; I couldn't find it, and it is perhaps contrary to what Senator Griff saidâis: how many people out there truly believe it is safe to drink alcohol during pregnancy? It is not whether they do it or not, because people do many things that, unfortunately, they know are very dangerous, both to them and to their unborn child, but how many people actually know? I suspect the vast majority would know. What that percentage is is probably worthwhile finding out to know just how effective the public health campaigns in this space have been. I would certainly endorse that. Sadly, in my home state of Western Australia, this is a very real issue. There was a significant study undertaken by the Telethon Kids Institute, which is a wonderful institute in my home state of Western Australia that looks into a variety of health matters affecting children. It was undertaking groundbreaking research into the prevalence of FASD in Western Australia. Sadly, this research is now a little out of date. It looked at the situation from 1980 to 2010. There were something like 210 identified cases, which is remarkably small, I would say. Unfortunately, I think everyone in this chamber knows that the problem has grown significantly worse since then. It is important that government focuses on it and tackles it, which this government has been doing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The impacts of FASD must not be understated. It produces significant problems with learning and behaviour. Again, as Senator Griff pointed out, the number of people involved in the criminal justice system who are affected by FASD is quite significant. It includes physical changes. There are certain facial characteristics and certain facial features that have been associated with FASD, such as a short horizontal length of the eye opening from the inner corner to the outer corner and changes to the structure of the upper lip and the nose. We're actually not just talking about changes to the structure of the brain but also talking about actual physical changes to those children. Obviously, those children grow up to be adults.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are learning and behavioural problems, obviously, which are the most well-known aspects of this. These include learning difficulties, memory problems, trouble with impulse control, trouble with attention span, ease of distraction, a degree of hyperactivity and difficulty in understanding the consequences of one's actions, which obviously has significant flow-on effects in terms of potential aggression and encounters with the criminal justice system. There is also difficulty in following instructions, difficulty with abstract thinking, slow cognition and difficulty with social relationships, something that is obviously very important to the wellbeing of children and children as they grow into adults.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The National Health and Medical Research Council does publish guidelines on reducing the health risk of drinking alcohol. That guidance is fairly clear on drinking alcohol whilst pregnant or breastfeeding. The guidelines state:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Women who are pregnant, planning a pregnancy or breastfeeding should not drink at all.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The guidelines on this matter are very clear. They go on to say:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The greatest harm to the foetus or breastfeeding infant occurs when drinking is at high and frequent levels, but no level of drinking is considered safe.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That has been the NHMRC guideline since at least 2009. Again, I tried to check whether it predates thatâI suspect it doesâbut I couldn't find that out. That is a very clear guideline from the NHMRC and something that I think needs to beâif it's not, and, as I say, I do not know the level of knowledge in the community on this issueâvery, very well known.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, contrary to Senator Griff's position, the government has taken action and continues to take action in this area. The government is committed to reducing alcohol-related harms to all Australians. Since 2014, the Australian government has committed $27 million to reducing the impact of FASD, fetal alcohol spectrum disorder. This began in the 2016-17 budget, when the Australian government committed $10.5 million over four yearsâthat is, 2016 to 2019-20âto take more action on FASD by building on earlier action plans. Funding is being provided for a range of activities including online telephone support for individuals and families affected by the disorder, improved access to diagnostic services, and prevention and education action across the country, obviously with an emphasis on communities of highest need, because, sadly, what the evidence shows is that this problem is not exclusive to but has a significant impact on Aboriginal communities in my home state of Western Australia. Therefore, the messages, the information and the support that need to be given have to be highly targeted and need to get to the people where they can have the most effect.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In November 2018, Minister Hunt launched the FASD Strategic Action Plan. To support the FASD Strategic Action Plan, the Australian government committed further funding of $7.2 million for activities that align with the priority areas of the ongoing strategic action plan: prevention, screening and diagnosis, management and support, and funding of priority groups. Funding is broken down: $1.47 million for prevention; $1.2 million for screening and diagnosis; $1.2 million to inform schools and workplaces and to support the justice and policing sectors; $1.27 million to tailor solutions to local communities; and just over $1Â½ million to continue existing activities, including the continued development of a one-stop shop digital hub for information tools, research and consumer support.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a lifelong physiological and neurodevelopmental impairment. It's a condition that is an outcome of parents either not being aware of the dangers of alcohol use or not being supported to stay healthy and strong during pregnancy. There is no cure for FASD and its effects will last a lifetime for those impacted. People with FASD can get help to do with learning and behaviour to maximise their independence and maximise their achievements over the course of their life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Once again, this is a very important issue. It's something that the government and the health minister take very seriously and it's something that the government is acting on.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="I0T" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator PRATT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:37</span>):  I'd also like to thank Senator Griff for giving us the opportunity to debate this critically important issue today. As we've already heard in the chamber, fetal alcohol spectrum disorder does have a lifelong and devastating impact on people and the wider community. It's a lifelong neurological and developmental disorder that can be seen in children. It's indeed a lifelong phenomenon, triggered of course by alcohol consumption during pregnancy. We know that it is likely to be more severe and more likely when consumption is excessive and frequent throughout the duration of a pregnancy. I do note, though, as has been highlighted, that there is no safe level of alcohol consumption according to health recommendations. It is also important to point out that it is more detrimental in families with intergenerational health problems. There is the influence of FASD in a single pregnancy. If drinking then occurs during the next intergenerational pregnancy, we can also realise intergenerational health issues. In cases of severe FASD, life expectancy can be seen to be only 34 years of age.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But I really would like to highlight that it is a condition that we shouldn't stigmatise as belonging to particular communities or within particular social groups. If people drink during pregnancy, it is likely to have developmental and neurological impacts on a person, despite the fact that they might otherwise be succeeding in life more broadly and that FASD, as a phenomenon, may not be particularly noticeable or attributable to the way that someone is in the world. So I think we should steer away from tagging or stigmatising particular communities with these issues.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd highlight that a Canadian study found people with FASD are 19 times more likely to be arrested at some point in their lives compared to neurotypical counterparts and that a significant number of young people in juvenile detention have FASD. The symptoms go unnoticed until a child reaches school age and they become more visible through activity. I notice that it's actually quite difficult, when young people have developmental or learning delay, to get a proper diagnosis for FASD. The diagnosis is incredibly expensive and quite often difficult for people to access, particularly when you're trying to work through and rule out a whole range of developmental or cognitive disorders. There might be cognitive, behavioural, health and learning difficulties that need to be assessed. It's a problem that FASD is not recognised as a disability in Australia, as per the Department of Human Services' disability list. I think that is a problem, particularly when other learning disabilities are so well recognised.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to give a particular shout-out to Aboriginal leaders in the Fitzroy Valley, who've been very active in addressing FASD in the community since the early 2000s. This is the Lililwan study, initiated by leaders in the Fitzroy Valley. They interviewed mothers and researchers and found that 55 per cent of women in that community had been using alcohol during the pregnancy but that women at that point in time simply did not know that alcohol could harm their unborn children. One of the report's authors said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">
                  <span style="&#xD;&#xA;    font-size:10pt;&#xD;&#xA;  " />Alcohol was used in over half of those pregnancies, but when women did use alcohol they did so at high levels, now this wasn't due to any intent to harm â¦</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was simply out of ignorance. They had no idea that drinking alcohol could harm their unborn child.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That community pushed for their own alcohol restrictions and they've been able to slow down the rates of alcohol use amongst pregnant women in that community very dramatically. James Fitzpatrick, one of the researchers, said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">â¦ we have worked incredibly hard on a strategic prevention strategy and we are starting to see the rates of fetal alcohol syndrome and alcohol use in pregnancy decrease.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to pay tribute to June Oscar, a proud Bunaba woman and a strong advocate for Indigenous Australians. She is the current First Nations commissioner in the Human Rights Commission. She received the Menzies School of Health Research medallion in her work with FASD.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd particularly also like to commend the work of the Western Australian government. In January 2019, the <span style="font-style:italic;">Western Australian alcohol and drug interagency strategy</span> was released by the WA Minister for Health, Roger Cook. It provides a guide for government and non-government organisations as well as the wider community to prevent and reduce the adverse impacts of alcohol and other drug use in WA. It has five key strategic areas, several of which make specific reference to FASD.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to highlight before the Senate today the state coroner's inquest into the deaths of 13 children and young persons in the Kimberley. The report of the state coroner's inquest was published on 7 February this year and had 42 recommendations, seven of which addressed the issue of FASD. It was very clear that there were concerns in a number of these deaths where the children had been parented by someone with FASD or they were impacted by FASD themselves. I would really encourage the government at a national level to look at those recommendations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Health minister Roger Cook has also led the charge for compulsory labelling of alcoholic beverages. This was successful last year in achieving this change with the Commonwealth in terms of there being mandatory pregnancy warnings on all alcoholic beverages. The AMA released a statement acknowledging the presence of the disorder in Australia and has recommended an approach to reducing FASD that is consistent with the broader campaign for combating problem drinking in Australia, including efforts to reduce the availability, affordability and accessibility of alcohol.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So today I join in calls on the government that we need a national approach on this issueâthat the national FASD strategic plan requires funding and requires support from the states to reduce the impact of FASD on the Australian community. I want to highlight that the drinking habits of Australians are changing and that public health education campaigns are working, including messages to pregnant women from all walks of life. But, sadly, it is still all too common to see pregnant women drinking, including women who are highly intoxicated during their pregnancy, in all walks of life in Australia. So we really do need to pay special attention to this issue to make sure that women have the message and that they get the support they need. Managing addiction, including alcohol addiction, is very difficult. It is not uncommon for pregnant women to have a conversation with each other to say, 'Goodness, how are you coping without having a drink?' Quite often we don't recognise how alcohol-dependent our society is or how much people reach out for and crave a drink. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator DI NATALE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Leader of the Australian Greens</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:47</span>):  Many people in Australia drink responsiblyâthey drink occasionallyâand for many it brings them pleasure. We know drinking patterns have changed over time. We know there is some social benefit to people consuming alcohol. But that shouldn't disguise the fact that alcohol consumption has an overwhelmingly negative impact on people's health, not just here in Australia but right around the world. It's the third-largest risk factor for disease burden globally and the eighth-highest risk factor for death worldwide. That means that almost four per cent of all deaths have alcohol as a major risk factor.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As somebody who worked as a GP, as a drug and alcohol doctor and then in public health, I know that you can't ignore the obvious consequences of alcohol consumption, particularly alcohol-related harms and alcohol dependence. Every GP in Australia would have experienced patients every day for whom alcohol is their major presenting factor. They may present because of social problems resulting from alcohol dependence. They may present with physical illness. We know there are hundreds of physical illnesses that are linked to alcohol consumption, whether it be cirrhosis of the liver or other metabolic conditions. And of course there's the huge toll of injuries associated with alcohol consumption. It has a major impact on individuals and our community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And we're learning more and more about FASDâthe effect of alcohol on a developing fetus. We heard in some of the contributions about what it can doâits physical manifestations, its impact on young children's ability to learn, particular behaviours, higher rates of incarceration and so on. It has a significant impact on the lives of those individuals, their families and their local communities. It is a debilitating collection of disorders, and they are entirely preventableâentirely preventable. Let me acknowledge and welcome the work of the Foundation for Alcohol Research and Education on raising awareness of FASD, but it's now time to ensure we do everything we can to turn things around.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that, like for so many other preventable health conditions, Indigenous people suffer disproportionately from the harms of alcohol. We know that ill health due to alcohol dependence and harmful use in the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander population was 4Â½ times greater than that experienced by non-Indigenous Australians in 2003. So we know what to do. The evidence is there. It's just a question of whether we're going to follow the evidence about what works.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the acute end of the spectrum, we've got to make sure that people who need treatment can get it; it's as simple as that. But we also know that, in Australia, half the people who are seeking alcohol and drug treatment can't access it, which is why, of course, the Greens want to see double the commitment to funding AAD treatment at the Commonwealth level, and we want the states to follow suit. We've got to do better when it comes to primary care. We know that brief intervention from a GP, a practice nurse or a maternal child health worker can have a big impact. But we know that, if we're going to really have an impact, prevention is where it's at.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've got to make sure that we close the loophole that, when it comes to the advertising and promotion of alcohol during children's viewing times, allows young kids to be targeted if they're watching sport. We've got to close that loophole, and that could be closed by the communications minister today. We know that, when logos like VB and XXXX are emblazoned on sports heroes' jumpers, we're sending the wrong message. Price is another factor. We know that, if we addressed the dog's breakfast that is the current taxation of alcohol, particularly the wine equalisation tax, and moved towards a volumetric type tax, it would have a huge impact. There is also labelling, and at the moment the dismal state of labelling is something to be ashamed of. We know availability, zoning and all those sorts of things also have an impact.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the reasons we haven't made changes is that this is an area where big, powerful, vested interests dominate the national debate. They lean on government through their lobbyists and through their donations, and, until we address the cancer in our democracy that is the role of these big vested interests, we cannot do what needs to be done to address the scale of this enormous challenge.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="122087" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator McCARTHY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Northern Territory</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:52</span>):  I rise to speak on this matter of public importance, and the issue of fetal alcohol spectrum disorder, or FASD, is very important. It is often referred to as the invisible disability. But I share with the Senate that, as far as my families and clan groups are concerned, it's not so invisible. Unfortunately, it's a very visible part of our daily life, a very visible part of the community life and a very visible part of the educational system in trying to deal with students across the Northern Territory, but in particular in our remote communities, who are suffering from FASD. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">FASD refers to the spectrum of fetal outcomes linked to alcohol use during pregnancy, and they may include physical, cognitive and/or developmental symptoms. It's often not noticed until the child reaches school age. From their learning and how they relate to their peers, it becomes apparent. The majority of children and adults who have FASD live with significant cognitive, behavioural, health and learning difficulties which are lifelong. And, unfortunately, a lack of research and data means we do not have a really clear picture of FASD prevalence in Australiaâthat is, from an academic research perspective. But I can certainly tell the Senate that there are many personal stories and information about FASD just in the Northern Territory, and concerns about FASD, I'm very aware, across WA and Queensland.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is believed up to half a million Australians could be on this spectrum. We know from the AMA that FASD is not confined to a particular community or demographic; it is a disorder that crosses socioeconomic, racial and educational boundaries. We also know that alcohol consumption statistics and epidemiological data on FASD prevalence from comparable countries suggest that FASD prevalence in Australia is higher than previously thought. In the US, for example, it's estimated that FASD affects, roughly, between two and five per cent of the population. The AMA also tells us that in some high-risk Indigenous communities the prevalence may be as high as 12 per cent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This disability is entirely preventable, and this is where our main efforts need to be focused. Again, in my home of the Northern Territory, the lack of reliable data means we don't know much about how many children and families are affected. But we do know from the 2015 Australian Early Development Census that some 37 per cent of children in the Northern Territory were considered 'developmentally vulnerable' across one or more domains. In some communities, it was as high as 50 per cent. Experts also estimate that in Central Australia one in five children could suffer from FASDâone in five. Again, all of these cases are entirely preventable. I'm pleased to say that in April last year the Northern Territory's first diagnostic centre for FASD opened in Central Australia. The centre, opened by the Central Australian Aboriginal Congress, helps ensure early diagnosis and immediate access to services. Early intervention and support improves psychosocial and behavioural outcomes for those affected by FASD. Wraparound services such as this provide important support for children and families.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Darwin in May last year, Aboriginal Peak Organisations Northern Territory, APO NT, hosted a landmark Top End forum on FASD. That forum brought together 180 delegates from 37 organisations across the Northern Territory including Aboriginal leaders, FASD experts, Aboriginal Community Controlled Organisations, government representatives, medical professionals, and non-government organisations. That forum heard from specialist neonatal and general paediatrician, Dr Mantho Kgosiemang. She spoke of her experience as a paediatrician in the Northern Territory and said the common effect that she sees with children affected by FASD is that they are born smaller than they should be. These children end up staying for a prolonged period of time in hospitalâwhether it's in Royal Darwin Hospital, Katherine Hospital or Tennant Creek Hospital, or in Alice Springs or Nhulunbuy, our children are spending way too much time in these hospitals. These prolonged hospital stays also affect family members, who may then be separated for longer from kin, culture and community. For remote communities, access to a paediatrician might be at most once a month, for example, in larger communities like Maningrida. But what about the smaller communities, like Yarralin? They may only get a paediatrician once every three to four months. In between, they are seen by GPs who, again, may just be visiting for a number of weeks. Aboriginal medical services and Aboriginal Controlled Community Health Services have a key role in working for change and driving change in our communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">FASD also increases the likelihood of a person coming into contact with the criminal justice system, and we've been hearing that from other senators here speaking to this MPI. Canadian research has found that people with FASD are approximately 19 times more likely to be arrested than their peers. Here in Australia, Dr James Fitzpatrick, a paediatrician and researcher working with children who have FASD, says 36 per cent of people in juvenile detention in WA have the disorder. That's just in WA. Not only would early diagnosis help get children listed on the National Disability Insurance Scheme and able to access support, but he believes it could help lower prison rates. Early intervention can provide the skills that reduce the likelihood that an individual with FASD will come into contact with the criminal justice system. Furthermore, it is vital that these interventions are culturally and linguistically appropriate. Let's remember: in the Northern Territory alone we have over 100 Aboriginal languages.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Dealing with issues such as FASD also relies on a willingness to take strong action overall on alcohol-related harm. The extreme levels of alcohol-related harm in the Northern Territory are well documented. Updated research from the Menzies School of Health Research indicates alcohol-related harm costs the Territory upward of $1.38 billion per year. We know alcohol-related harm is hurting the Territory, both socially and economically. For this reason, the Northern Territory Labor government introduced the most wide-ranging alcohol reform agenda in the country. The NT Alcohol Harm Minimisation Action Plan 2018-2019 was introduced nearly 18 months ago as an evidence based approach to tackling alcohol-related harm. The plan is focused on delivering generational change through alcohol reforms.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The implementation of 75 of the 219 recommendations is complete, and significant progress is being made against the remaining recommendations. There are some early positive results from the reforms, with reductions in alcohol-fuelled assaults, domestic violence, antisocial behaviour and emergency department presentationsâa really, really critical aspect of monitoring the steps in this action plan. NT-wide, emergency department presentations had reduced by 24 per cent at December 2018, compared to 2017. Non-government organisations, community groups and industry are closely involved in the successful implementation of the recommendations. A major problem in many NT towns and communities is the secondary supply of alcohol. Coordinated measures such as the Banned Drinker Register are stopping problem drinkers from accessing takeaway alcohol.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is critical that the parliament of Australia be acutely aware of FASD and of the need for thorough research to take place in our country to protect families and their children from this disease, which is incurable.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">The Nationals Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:03</span>):  In rising to speak on this matter, I note that this is not my first speech. I thank Senator Griff for raising fetal alcohol spectrum disorder, or FASD. I also thank Senator McCarthy for her contribution, because I recognise that this is an issue in the Territory. But it is also an issue across all of rural and regional Australia, which makes it an issue that we must all be aware of and that we must all address.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">'FASD' is an overarching term. It's used to describe a range of cognitive, physical, mental, behavioural, learning and developmental disorders that result from fetal exposure to alcohol. Given the prevalence of FASD in rural, regional and remote Australiaâespecially, but not exclusively, in our Indigenous communitiesâI am very proud, as a Nationals senator for New South Wales, of the work the coalition government has done since 2014 with respect to this issue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite its prevalence, FASD often goes undiagnosed. The National Rural Health Alliance has observed that children suffering from FASD might be regarded as wilful or undisciplined, when in fact they have little control over their behaviour. That is why it is a very important issue for us to continue to work on. It is an entirely preventable but incurable condition caused by a baby's exposure to alcohol in the womb. If an expectant mother has zero alcohol consumption during pregnancy then her child has zero risk of the developmental abnormalities from exposure to alcohol. I am very pleased to say that awareness of this issue is increasing and therefore more expectant mothers are aware of the risks.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">FASD is currently the largest cause of non-genetic at-birth brain damage in the country and, tragically, the average life expectancy for a child born with FASD is only 34 years of age. It is at epidemic proportions, particularly in rural and regional Australia, which is exactly why the coalition government continues to pursue a national approach, in collaboration with families, communities, service providers and state governments, to tackle it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a National, I'm very proud that the National minister at the time responsible for rural Indigenous health, Senator Fiona Nash, commissioned the FASD Strategic Action Plan and provided $9.2 million in funding for its development. This was a watershed moment for Australia. It was the first time there was national recognition that we have an epidemic in Australia of babies born with brain damage because of alcohol consumption during pregnancy. In the 2016-17 budget, the coalition committed $10.5 million over four years to take action on FASD. The funding was provided for a range of activities, including providing online telephone support for individuals and families affected by FASD, improving access to FASD diagnostic services, and undertaking prevention and education across the country. The focus of this funding has been very strongly directed at communities of high need, which, as I've already mentioned, is predominantly in rural, regional and remote Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2018, Minister Hunt launched the FASD Strategic Action Plan, which this original funding developed. This plan provides a clear pathway of priorities and opportunities to improve the prevention, diagnosis, support and management of FASD in Australia. Critically, the strategic action plan recognises that, with early and accurate diagnosis, along with early individualised interventions for children and adults who have FASD, the quality of life outcomes for individuals and their families can be substantially improved. Upon the release of the strategic action plan, the coalition government committed further funding to support the delivery of activities that align with the planned priority areasânamely, prevention, screening and diagnosis, management and support, and priority groups.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">FASD is an epidemic in rural, regional and remote communities and, given the scale of the issue in Australia, the Liberals and the Nationals, in government, continue to take a national approach to combat it. Since 2014, the total funding committed to reducing the impact of FASD has been over $27 million. We are delivering on the FASD Strategic Action Plan and are investing in the activities which have been shown to be effective, and these activities are working. Awareness of FASD is growing and, through various government supported programs and initiatives, mums-to-be are being supported and are receiving clear and consistent advice as to what is safe and that it is safest not to consume alcohol while pregnant.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Bill amends the <span style="font-style:italic;">Migration Act 1958 </span>to repeal the provisions inserted by the <span style="font-style:italic;">Home Affairs Legislation Amendment (Miscellaneous Measures) Act 2019, </span>also known as Labor's Medivac Law, and extend the existing return and removal mechanisms to transitory persons brought to Australia from a regional processing country under section 198C of the Migration Act.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Labor's Medivac Law was passed by Parliament in February on a lie. There is no medical emergency on Manus or Nauru. There are no children on Manus or Nauru.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Labor's Medivac Law, which they teamed with the Greens to rush through the Parliament, has only served to weaken Australia's border protection policies by effectively removing the ability of the Government to decide who comes to Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Government has significantly less powers to prevent the transfer of a person with bad character under Labor's Medivac Law than under any other process. In fact, the Minister actually has more power to stop individuals coming on a tourist visa than to stop those with bad character that seek to be transferred under Labor's Medivac Law.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">There are currently people in PNG and Nauru who are charged with crimes against children, are being investigated for the supply of illicit drugs or have posted terror-related information online and the Government has no discretion to prevent their transfer to Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">There was never a need for Labor's Medivac Law. The Government's Any law which removes the Government's ultimate discretion to decide who enters Australia's borders undermines our strong border protection policies. As a nation, it is imperative that we are able to determine who enters Australia and whether they should remain within our borders permanently.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">existing medical transfer provisions have brought over 900 people from an RPC to Australia to receive medical treatment. This demonstrates that the Medivac Laws were nothing more than a short-sighted political tactic for Labor to appeal to Greens voters for the May election.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Let me be clear, while this Bill removes one medical transfer pathway established by Labor's Medivac Law, there will remain the existing process to manage medical transfers. Transferees requiring medical treatment not available in a regional processing country will be able to be transferred to a third country or Australia for assessment or treatment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Labor's Medivac Law failed to provide a mechanism to return or remove transitory persons brought to Australia under section 198C back to a regional processing country or other third country. Consistent with provisions in place for transitory persons brought to Australia under section 198B, transitory persons are expected to return to a regional processing country once they no longer need to be in Australia for the temporary purpose for which they came. This Bill will rectify this inconsistency.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Department of Home Affairs has advised me that since the <span style="font-style:italic;">Migration Amendment (Urgent Medical Treatment) Bill </span>was first introduced by Dr Kerryn Phelps in December 2018, there has been a marked increase in self-harming behaviours in regional processing countries. Many of these acts are undertaken for the explicit purpose of manipulating the system and gaining access to Australia. This Bill removes the motivation for transferees to engage in this dangerous behaviour.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This is a mess entirely of Labor's making. The Labor Party enthusiastically voted for this law without having any idea of the consequences.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="256063" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BRAGG</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:12</span>):  I rise to speak about the Timor Sea Maritime Boundaries Treaty Consequential Amendments Bill 2019 and related bills. The coalition has a fantastic record when it comes to trade and foreign policy. In fact, I would argue that the last six years of coalition government, which have seen us complete very significant trade and investment agreements, is a golden age in trade and foreign policy in Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When we came to government in 2013, Labor had been unable to resolve trade agreements with Japan and with China. We were able to deliver those two agreements, as well as one with Korea, and subsequently with Indonesia and Hong Kong, and the list goes on. At the same time, we've been able to work with our foreign counterparts and deliver the Trans-Pacific Partnership. This occurred after many people, including the Labor leader at the time, said that we ought to give up on trying to conclude the Trans-Pacific Partnership, because the President of the United States had walked away from it. We've been able to land a good strong grouping of bilateral agreements in our own region as well as multilateral or, as they say in trade talk, plurilateral agreements, like the Trans-Pacific Partnership.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the outstanding issues has been how we resolve petroleum arrangements with East Timor. This agreement effectively gives us a road map for dealing with Timor-Leste, I should say.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our record here on Timor-Leste, as a nation and with a bipartisan political approach, has been very strong. People would recall that the Governor-General, when he was a general in the Army, led the INTERFET troops into Timor-Leste in 1999, when Indonesia and Timor-Leste had had some disagreements. We now see an independent Timor-Leste, and this milestone is a very important one. The former foreign minister Julie Bishop was able to agree with Timor-Leste in March 2018 on a way forward for these important resources for East Timor.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Effectively, what these bills do is establish permanent boundaries between Australia and Timor-Leste, and these are important for providing legal certainty. Anyone who has ever spent a day working in private enterprise knows that you need to have legal certainty if you want to have any private investment. Private investment is the only way you actually create jobs, because it's private businesses that invest in people's ideas, if you like, and then that results in jobs. Legal certainty is very important. That's whyâas a nation like Australia, which has relied upon foreign investment since the First Fleetâwe obviously regard that as a very important outworking.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What this provides is tax and regulatory certainty for Australia, for Timor-Leste and for the private sector companies. I understand that those companies have been consulted with very heavily by the minister and his department in the development of this treaty. My understanding is that everyone is broadly happy, which is quite remarkable in these fields of foreign relations, trade and taxation. That's certainly a very good sign. These bills have been considered by parliamentary committees, which have given the green light that they should proceed. I understand there is also bipartisan support for these measures, which is always good in the area of foreign affairs and trade. We always look to see bipartisanship, because we want to present a stable appearance of Australia to the outside world. We only hope that our opponents do better in the future in landing trade agreements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Obviously, as a nation that is very exposed to the outside world, Australia relies upon a strong region for our prosperity and for our stability and security. It has often been said that a strong Timor-Leste is an integral part of a strong Australia and a strong Pacific. We would certainly regard landing this agreement as a very important ingredient in having some certainty within Timor-Leste, in terms of their economy and in terms of their social stability, that this has now been resolved after some years of consternation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">More broadly, we have sought to step up our efforts in the Pacific and in our region, because we know that it's critical to have strong states, strong partners and strong allies. We want to see all of our friends in the Pacific regarding Australia as a friend. In the case of Timor-Leste, we have certainly proven ourselves as a good friend both militarily over the long run but also now in terms of having resolved this very important issue for Timor-Leste, which has been a longstanding point of consternation in that nation. The government of Timor-Leste is the other important party here, alongside the Australian government and also the private sector. The representative of Timor-Leste has said that it's a good treaty and that it is 'equitable and forward-looking'. That's pretty good, I would have thought, as an endorsement from Timor-Leste.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I said before, the government and the minister have been able to agree on a good framework here. This would be considered an important milestone for Timor-Leste and Australian relations. It does, as I said before, assure the private sector that there is certainty. I think that bodes well, not only for existing investments but also for future investments. This bill should lay a framework that people feel they can invest in. In the long run it is really only the existence of private investment that will provide job creation and prosperity, not only here but in Timor-Leste.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Beyond just the bilateral groupings hereâAustralia and Timor-Lesteâthe United Nations has also indicated that this is a good framework. In fact, this historic treaty was signed at the United Nations, in the presence of the United Nations Secretary-General and the chair of their conciliation commission. You certainly couldn't ask for better than that as far as a treaty goes. Many have said that international law is not always effective. But certainly when both affected parties say that this is a good deal, and the private sector companies are also saying it is a good and a fair deal, and on top of that you get the trifecta of having the United Nations Secretary-General, no less, saying that this is a good thing, I think that's a pretty strong trifecta. So, if anyone was worried about the processes, hopefully they would be assured that all three groups were happy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a growing economic relationship with Timor-Leste. In 2018, two-way merchandise trade between Australia and Timor-Leste was worth around $21 million, and our exports were around $20 million. Primarily we were exporting vehicles, and we have been importing mainly coffee from Timor-Leste. I assume that most of that goes down to Melbourne, where I'm told they have quite good coffee! As I said, this is certainly a good deal, and I think all the groups are very satisfied. So, I certainly commend this bill to the Senate.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="282997" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SCARR</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:22</span>):  This is not my first speech, and I'm delighted to have the opportunity, on the first occasion that I'm speaking to the chamber, to endorse this piece of legislation coming before the Senate. I'd like to make three preliminary points prior to talking about the specifics of this bill. Firstly, Australia has a great and rich relationship with Timor-Leste and also the people of Timor-Leste, and that relationship goes back decades. Senators may have heard of Sparrow Force. Sparrow Force was a force of commandos who went into Timor-Leste after Pearl Harbor was attacked at the outbreak of World War II, and with support from the people of Timor-Leste they fought valiantly over many months, fighting against the Japanese invaders. Famously, the commander of the Japanese forces said, in an address to these commandos, 'You alone are the ones who have not surrendered.' And they didn't surrender, until the last moment, when they had no options available and they sought evacuation from the island. Then, of course, was the fight for independence of East Timor and the great support this Australian country gave to the people of East Timor during their most difficult time. And now we have cemented that relationship through the passage of this treaty, and we're now considering the legislation before the Senate here today, the Timor Sea Maritime Boundaries Treaty Consequential Amendments Bill 2019 and related bills.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second preliminary point I'd like to make is that I come from the resources industry. For the past 12 years I've been a senior executive in the mining industry, and I've worked in some of the poorest countries in the world, including Laos. I understand from firsthand experience the difference that the resources industry can make to some of the poorest people on the face of the earth. Natural gas provides an opportunity for the people of East Timor to generate the revenue streams they need to provide the schools, the hospitals, the defence force and all the other public services which we in this country take for granted. It's a great opportunity for the people of East Timor to have the benefit of those revenue streams. It also provides an opportunity for their young people to participate in a great industry, the oil and gas industry. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that there's discussion at the moment as to whether or not the gas will be further processed in East Timor or in Australia. I think that's great. I think it would be a wonderful thing, a great thing, if the gas were processed further in East Timor and it provided job opportunities and economic activity for the people of East Timor. Ultimately, that is a question for the project proponents, which I note include a great Australian company, Woodside, and also the East Timorese oil and gas company. It's a question for those joint-venture participants as to whether or not they want to process that gas in East Timor or in Australia. But I dearly hope that there is an opportunity for young people in East Timor to develop skills, have the benefit of learning from some of the best in the industry in relation to the oil and gas industry and be able to take those skills forward for themselves and their families. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The last point I would like to make on a preliminary basis is to give my thanks, as a senator from Queensland, to all of the officials who were involved in the negotiation of the treaty and the legislation. I note, based on my experience, that there's probably nothing more complicated in the professional world of the resources industry than cross-border tax issues. This legislation deals with those issues. It removes any doubt with respect to the tax consequences flowing from the treaty and the legislation, and it provides certainty to the proponents moving forward with respect to the tax basis upon which they can proceed with the development of this gas field. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it's fair to say that this issue has been something which has come between, at various times, the people of Australia and East Timor. It's been an issue which has caused great controversy with respect to our relationship and it really is a wonderful occasion that we've been able to solve this and that East Timor is going to get the benefit of some of those gas fields. I hope that the project proponents bring forward and develop the oil and gas fields as quickly as possible for the benefit of their shareholders, for the benefit of the government of East Timor and the government of Australia, and also for the people who may enjoy direct benefits from those projects in terms of employment and also their families. I hope that that can progress as quickly as possible. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would also like to pay tribute to Australia's then Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Hon. Julie Bishop, who was intimately involved in the resolution of this issue. She was our Minister for Foreign Affairs when the treaty was actually signed and I think, once again, this chamber and the people of Australia should note the great contribution that the Hon. Julie Bishop has made to this country and its relationships with some of our closest countries. That includes not just Timor-Leste but also Papua New Guinea, where I lived and worked for 2Â½ years. I know the Hon. Julie Bishop also had a great relationship with the people of Papua New Guinea as part of her remit as foreign affairs minister. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What is the treaty? The treaty achieves three basic things. Firstly, it resolves what was a difficult issue around where the maritime borders and boundaries were between Australia and Timor-Leste. Secondly, it recognises both states' sovereign rights in the creation of the Greater Sunrise special regime for the joint development, exploitation and management of the Greater Sunrise gas fields. Thirdly, it provides for transitional arrangements to provide regulatory certainty and continuity for affected oil and gas projects in the Timor Sea. The treaty makes clear that the outcome represents a mutual accommodation which was without prejudice to either side's legal position. Now we find that the treaty is going to be legislated for in this place, and both parties will be able to move forward. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The revenue implications of the treaty are significantâsignificant for the people of East Timor. Australia and Timor-Leste have agreed that, from the date the treaty enters into force, Timor-Leste will receive all future upstream revenue derived from the Bayu-Undan and Kitan in the existing Joint Petroleum Development Area. Previously, both Australia and Timor-Leste received benefits from revenue derived from petroleum activities in this areaâ90 per cent to Timor-Leste and 10 per cent to Australiaâbut from the time of passage of this legislation 100 per cent of the benefit of that upstream revenue will now go to Timor-Leste. That is a very positive outcome. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia and Timor-Leste have also agreed that the Buffalo oilfield, which previously fell within the continental shelf of Australia, will fall within the continental shelf of Timor-Leste. Accordingly, Timor-Leste will also get the benefit of all revenue generated from that oilfield. Again, that's an extremely positive thing for the people of Timor-Leste. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In terms of implementing the legislation, this bill deals with a number of further matters that need to be dealt with on a consequential basis. That includes issues dealing with, for example, the section of the Bayu-Undan pipeline international offshore area and creating a new pipeline licence to enable Australia to exercise jurisdiction in an area of foreign continental shelf.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The purpose of the government amendment is to give effect to an understanding reached, between the governments of Australia and Timor-Leste, on the decommissioning of the section of the Bayu-Undan pipeline that will sit on Timor-Leste's continental shelf. You can see that spirit of cooperation between the Australian government and the government of Timor-Leste in resolving this extremely complicated issue. That's a very positive thing, and I applaud it. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Timor-Leste, while recognising Australia's exclusive jurisdiction over the regulation of the entire Bayu-Undan pipeline, has expressed its preference for this section of the pipeline to be decommissioned by removal and, noting the removal of property from petroleum title areas is the base case in Australia, Australia has agreed to this approach. It was fit and proper that Australia do so. That amendment will ensure that this section of pipeline must be removed before the Australian licence for the pipeline, and therefore the responsibilities of the licensee, will end. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a number of other consequential matters that are dealt with in the bill, including in relation to a passenger movement charge. This will also assist with respect to persons departing from Australia for the purpose of travel to the Greater Sunrise Special Regime area in connection with petroleum activities. They shall be exempt from the passenger movement charge, as was previously the case with a person travelling to the Joint Petroleum Development Area. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then there are some important issues dealt with in the Treasury Laws Amendment (Timor Sea Maritime Boundaries Treaty) Bill 2019. Schedule 1 of this bill amends the tax law to fulfil Australia's taxation-related obligations under the treaty, to provide conditions equivalent to participants in 'transitioned petroleum activities' in the Timor Sea. That is extremely important. It is important that the project proponents are kept whole, with respect to their expectations regarding taxation treatments. It's an extremely complicated issue but a very important one for the project proponents, and they will be kept whole in the way they're treated by the respective revenue authorities in Australia and Timor-Leste. That is important for their commercial expectations being met. I applaud the government of Australia and the government of Timor-Leste for reaching that accommodation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the sort of accommodation that promotes investments in countries. Coming from Queensland and having seen the experience of the Queensland government in dealing with the Adani mining project in Queensland, I wish it were accommodation provided to all mining and resource project proponents seeking to invest in this country and in this region. It's important to give investors the confidence that they can go ahead with investments. I applaud both the government of Timor-Leste and Australia in this regard.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I return to the opening comments I made about the special relationshipâand it is a special relationshipâbetween Australia and Timor-Leste. I have friends who actually served in the Australian Defence Force in East Timor during the troubles. They are extremely proud of the service they gave those people and extremely proud of the service they gave this country. I absolutely applaud the efforts of the Australian government and the efforts of the government of Timor-Leste in initially reaching the treaty and coming to an agreement on the treaty. Now, with this bill before this house, hopefully the projects which are encompassed by the treaty in this bill can be advanced for the good of the people of Australia and for the good of the people of Timor-Leste.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="245212" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CANAVAN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Resources and Northern Australia and Deputy Leader of The Nationals in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:36</span>):  I'd like to thank all the senators who have contributed to this very important debate on these very important bills. It's a historic occasion to mark our burgeoning relationship with Timor-Leste to see these bills pass through this place. They passed through the other place last week. These bills give effect to the treaty between Australia and the Democratic Republic of Timor-Leste, establishing their maritime boundaries in the Timor Sea. The treaty is a historic achievement for Australia and Timor-Leste and its implementation is firmly in Australia's national interest.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Timor Sea Maritime Boundaries Treaty Consequential Amendments Bill 2019 implements the new maritime boundaries agreed under the treaty and transfers the Joint Petroleum Development Area and some adjacent areas to Timor-Leste's exclusive jurisdiction. This bill also makes amendments to the petroleum title areas affected by the boundary and provides for two new international offshore areas for the purposes of the Bayu-Undan pipeline corridor and a potential Greater Sunrise pipeline corridor. Further, this bill gives effect to the Greater Sunrise special regime area and the legal infrastructure to facilitate the joint development, exploitation and management of petroleum activities in the Greater Sunrise gas fields, creating a pathway for the development of the resources. The economic benefits will be significant, particularly for Timor-Leste. The Treasury Laws Amendment (Timor Sea Maritime Boundaries Treaty) Bill 2019 fulfils Australia's taxation-related obligations under the treaty by ensuring that taxation arrangements applying to transitioned petroleum activities will continue in accordance with annex D to the treaty. Finally, passage of these bills and the Passenger Movement Charge Amendment (Timor Sea Maritime Boundaries Treaty) Bill 2019 fundamentally affirms Australia's commitment to a robust, mutually beneficial and stronger bilateral relationship with Timor-Leste and to international law and the rules based order more generally. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I too would like to express my thanks to the officials involved in negotiating this treaty and also formulating the resulting amendments to Australian law here. I thank Senator Scarr for his recognition of those officials, because they have worked tirelessly over a number of years to see this to fruition. As Senator Scarr commented, they can be particularly complex negotiations. It's fantastic to have seen them brought to fruition in March last year with the signing of the treatyâand today with the passage of these bills. I'd also like to thank and recognise, as Senator Scarr did as well, the efforts of the former foreign minister Julie Bishop, who played an integral role in the negotiations and in finalising the treaty itself, which has led us here today to make changes to our own petroleum laws.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Throughout this process, the Australian government has recognised and sought to work with the government of Timor-Leste to give it the power to progress its economic development aims and objectives. We have worked very closely with the Timor-Leste government on a number of different proposals and opportunities for that to occur. We fully recognise the desire of the Timor-Leste government to take chargeâbe master of its own destinyâand to seek to see the development of its resources in the way it sees fit for its national interests. The passage of these bills and the treaty itself do provide Timor-Leste with clear sovereignty over what was formerly the Joint Petroleum Development Area so that it can pursue those objectives and aims. The Australian government stands ready and able to ensure that Timor-Leste can develop a strong economic base for its people and the job opportunities that will flow from that. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Gas developments have already played an important role in the development of Timor-Leste. The Bayu-Undan field is already developed and has provided significant benefits to the Timor-Leste government. It's a fulcrum of the cooperation between our two governments, given that that gas and those resources are sent to Darwin in Australia for processing but provide the Timor-Leste government with substantial royalties and funding. I'm confident that future developments, particularly of the Greater Sunrise regime, will continue to see similar cooperation between our two governments. As I have said, we would like to work very closely with the Timor-Leste government to ensure its development aims and objectives are fulfilled. The finalisation of this treaty will give us an opportunity to do that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We do have a shared interest too in making sure that demand continues to grow for high-quality natural gas, which we're lucky to have abundantly in both of our jurisdictions. Australia is obviously a very large developer and producer of gas and is indeed the largest LNG gas exporter now. While we have a number of competitors in our region to supply gas, including Timor, we have a shared interest to make sure that those markets do develop and that demand increases. We're working closely with the United States, Japan and other countries to ensure that clean natural gas is used more fulsomely in our region because it can cut pollution, particularly air pollution, if it replaces fuels that have a lot more particulates in them than gas does. It can also of course lower carbon emissions because natural gas has a lower carbon content than other alternative fuels, such as coal. We'll continue to work with the Timorese government and the wider region to ensure that those development goals occur, not only for the people of Timor-Leste but also to help development right through our region.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd also like to thank the opposition for their support on these bills. They have been extremely supportive throughout the process. I thank my counterpartsâMr Clare before the election and Mr Fitzgibbon nowâfor their support of these related changes in our petroleum laws. It is a unifying moment not just for our two countries but our country as well to see this legislation through. I'm confident that with this legislation passing we'll have a new chapter in our relationship. There is some symmetry that this legislation is passing on the 20th anniversary of the INTERFET deployment to Timor-Leste. Indeed, it was only the other day that the 20-year anniversary date marked the referendum in Timor-Leste that ultimately led to its independence. Now, hopefully, through the changes in this treaty, that independence will only grow stronger for the Timor-Leste people, and our relationship will do so as well.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="e68" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator STERLE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:45</span>):  I rise to speak on the Australian Veterans' Recognition (Putting Veterans and Their Families First) Bill 2019. I'm grateful for the opportunity to speak on the bill, which importantly has bipartisan support. The bill creates a new act that will provide a framework for governments, business and the community to recognise and acknowledge the unique nature of military service, as well as to ensure support for veterans and their families.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm also delighted that this bill will establish the Australian Defence Veterans' Covenant. This is an incredibly important development. Those in this place will be aware that in September last year it was Labor that first announced that, if elected, it would establish a military covenant. Labor's proposed covenant would have covered both current and ex serving personnel and their families. We saw the need to recognise their commitment and sacrifice in serving our country by formalising Australia's commitment to provide them with the ongoing support that they seek and require. This is why Labor is united in welcoming the government's adoption of a covenant through the bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, I must note that we would have liked to see a covenant for all Defence personnel, current and serving, as well as their families. It is unfortunate that what is before us today only covers those who have previously served and their loved ones. Another notable absence from today's bill, which was to be part of Labor's proposal, is the inclusion of annual reporting in the form of a statement to parliament. We wanted this so as to ensure that, whoever the government is, the government is accountable in meeting its obligation to current and ex serving personnel.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When this bill was first introduced in the 45th Parliament, we raised our concerns at the omission of these elements. We therefore referred the bill to a Senate inquiry so that those with a lived experience of service were provided with the opportunity to view and give feedback on the government's proposed covenant. This was followed by providing additional comments of these issues as part of the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Legislation Committee's inquiry report. It was Labor's view, both then and now, that thorough consultation with those who were to be affected by the covenant ought to occur.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While we do believe it is a shame and a missed opportunity to not include those currently serving, I must also be clear that this does not negate the overwhelming positives of this covenant. For this reason, Labor fully supports this bill in both principle and practice. The art of compromise sometimes requires us to put the pragmatic over the perfect. This could serve as a lesson for some of those who sit in this place. However, it is important to put on the record that this is another example of a Labor policy that the government has thought a worthwhile idea and decided to pursue. On behalf of Labor, we do thank them for that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In order to not further hold up the passage of this legislation, we requested that the Senate committee conclude their inquiry by 22 March both to enable examination of the legislation and for the process to be completed in time to be reviewed in the Senate by early April. We believed this was appropriate and would ensure that there was time to review the legislation, enable the current and ex servicing community the opportunity to be involved in the process and not delay the passage of the bill. The committee did indeed report back on 22 March, recommending the bill be passed without amendment. At the same time, Labor senators on the committee canvassed the above issues of including current serving personnel and strengthening the reporting element in the additional comments to the report. However, as it happened, while the bill was debated in April, there was not sufficient time for the bill to be passed in the House of Representatives in the final sitting week before the election, and therefore the bill lapsed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Given the Senate committee's recommendation, the broad support for the bill and for the covenant from the veteran community, and the delay in the bill's passage, Labor is now willing to be pragmatic and support the bill in its current form. Our commitment to those who served is formalised in this covenant, and it was vital that we get it right. In addition to the introduction of the covenant, this bill inserts a general recognition clause which acknowledges the unique nature of military service, the demands we place on those who serve, the additional support they may require post service, and the Commonwealth's commitment to supporting veterans. These are but some of the reasons Labor wholeheartedly supports this recognition and our ongoing obligation to those who have put their lives on hold in service to our country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As an extension of this general recognition, the bill also includes an overarching statement in relation to the beneficial nature of Veterans' Affairs portfolio legislation, making it clear that the legislation has a beneficial purpose and should be interpreted accordingly. This section will note that the Commonwealth is committed to ensuring that those who make decisions involving veterans will interpret legislation in a way that benefits veterans and their families, where that interpretation is consistent with the purpose of the provision. This bill will also provide for departmental training to ensure decision-makers understand and appropriately apply the beneficial legislation to support the intent of this clause. In addition, a paragraph will also be inserted that will provide that claims decisions will be made within a time that is proportionate to the complexity of the matter, acknowledging the variety of complex client claims and that there will be differences in timeliness. One of the most common complaints about the Department of Veterans' Affairs, the DVA, is the lengthy and complex claims process. This commitment to timeliness will be welcomed by the veteran and ex-serving community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill will also provide recognition of veterans and their families in the form of a lapel pin, cards and other artefacts. These should not be seen as mere platitudes, though. While many ex-service organisations are broadly supportive of veterans' recognition and items like lapel pins and cards, they've also said this must be backed up with substance, such as better veterans' support services. Labor wholeheartedly agrees. The issues facing our veterans and currently serving servicemen and women are of the utmost importance.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I would like to read the words of the covenant:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">We, the people of Australia, respect and give thanks to all those who have served in our defence force and their families.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">We acknowledge the unique nature of military service and the sacrifice demanded of all who commit to defend our nation.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">We undertake to preserve the memory and deeds of all who have served and promise to welcome, embrace and support all military veterans as respected and valued members of our community.</span>
                </p>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator ROBERTS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:53</span>):  As servants to the people of Queensland and Australia, we applaud this bill, the Australian Veterans' Recognition (Putting Veterans and Their Families First) Bill 2019, and will support it. It's very important to note that veterans are self-selected as people who love our country, are selfless and have initiative. This is a wonderful resource we have, and yet we've destroyed that, in many cases. One only has to go to an Anzac Day ceremony, or talk with veterans, as we go about our business of listening around the country, to find in veterans a love of our country and a commitment to our country and to serving our country. These people have a lot of talent and need to have the ability to offer that. However, they face enormous pressure, stress and hurt that can crippleâand, indeed, some have been crippledâand they can be crippled in more ways than just physically. The Romans knew that, because they talked about returning centurions no longer being the same as they were before they left.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One Nation honours that service, that dedication and that valour. It is really remarkable what these people do for our country. That's why we've taken up the vets' cause for several years now, not only for individuals but also for vets as a group. We have many individuals who we've assisted in a variety of ways, whether it be talking about PTSDâhelping them with support for PTSDâphysical ailments, treatment with the Department of Veterans' Affairs or simply understanding their issues. It is important for us to recognise, symbolically, what these people have done, and that symbolic recognition is in this bill. We applaud the government for that. And it is deserved; it is highly deserved.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, we compliment the government for the beneficial interpretation in making decisions on the health and welfare of vets. That's welcome, and it's about time. But that doesn't guarantee that they will be supported or get the treatment they need. What we need to ensure is that the Department of Veterans' Affairs is no longer callous or sloppy or continuing to deny vets the care they deserve. We've heard accusations of that and we've seen instances of it. So we hope that this is foreshadowing a change in the Department of Veterans' Affairs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The DVA card, or the Department of Veterans' Affairs card, will make it easier to identify a vet as a veteran, and that's necessary. The overarching statements of principle we support. I also want to take this opportunity, though, to commend the many volunteers who have formed support and advisory groups for our veterans. However, the formation of these very groupsâand they're called microservice groupsâshows that the Department of Veterans' Affairs is not currently meeting veterans' needs. So we hope that the bill is more than just words, an ID card and a pin number. We hope the Department of Veterans' Affairs makes real changes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Someone said a few years agoâI can't remember the source: 'We send them, we bend them, but we don't mend them.' We hope that now we can say that we mend them. Our vets deserve to be appreciated and honoured, and above all our vets deserve to be cared for. We support this bill and commend the government for it.</span>

I'd like to commence by acknowledging all those who have served, and are serving, and their families for the sacrifices that they make so our freedoms go forth into the night. We can sleep safely in our beds because of the work and the service of these men and women.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've long called for the introduction of an Australian Defence Veterans' Covenant to more formally recognise and articulate the valued contribution that current and former members of the Australian Defence Force and their families make, and have made, to our nation. In 2014, I foreshadowed in my maiden speech the need for a covenant based on the principles of the covenant in the UK, and I have repeatedly pushed and advocatedâand made myself a bit of a pest in the offices of certain ministersâfor such an important reform and acknowledgement of the service and the sacrifice that is made by those who have served and are serving.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">After my maiden speech in 2014, I wrote to the Prime Minister, to Mr Shorten, the then Leader of the Opposition, and to relevant ministers and shadow ministers. I wrote to all senators in this place, regardless of their political colourâLabor, Liberal, Nationals, Greens and the various Independentsâasking for multiparty support to bring forward such a covenant. This covenant, and this idea of how we acknowledge those who have served, is beyond party politics. It should be beyond the madness that sometimes envelopes this building and this chamber, and it's something that I think we all agree on. Sometimes we just find it hard to find that agreement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As part of this push, I convened roundtables with the various ex-service organisationsâand there are many of them. I met with relevant members of the government and other stakeholders to try and find a pathway towards getting this covenant established here in Australia.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2015, I launched a petition to engage with the broader Australian community to try and build support for the covenant, because, if you want to achieve change, you've got to sometimes bring the community with you. In terms of the covenant as an issue, those who have a little understanding of this area know that it can work in Britain, but Britain does have a different system to how we treat our veterans here. The Australian Defence Veterans' Covenant, as set out in this bill, is supported by the Veterans' Recognition Program, which includes three parts: the veterans' card, lapel pin and oath.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The first, the veterans' card, is a redesign of the existing white and gold health cards issued by the Department of Veterans' Affairs. The veterans' card will make it easier for Australians to recognise and respect the contribution that veterans have made to our country. Some veterans will receive their new-look cards as their existing card expires, and all other cards will be replaced by the phased implementation process that is currently underway. Businesses will acknowledge the current health cards during the transition, as will healthcare and service providers. The new-look veteran card will continue to provide access to health services and benefits as well as to additional concessions and benefits from businesses, organisations and community groups which chose to support the covenant.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At this point I would encourage those who are in business, whether as small business owners or working in larger businesses, to understand and to think what they can do to support those who have served and are serving, not just in terms of a card or concessions but in terms of the benefits of employing those who have served our country. Over the coming months, each business, organisation and community group will receive an information pack outlining how they can support the covenant and connect with the veteran community. If you are part of a business, an organisation or a community group and would like to show support for veterans by offering benefits or concessions for veteran cardholders, you can do so by registering your interest on the department's website. It should be stressed, and I will stress it with emphasis, that any benefits or concessions provided will be at the discretion of the participating businesses and organisations, and I would stress to those organisations, whether commercial or NGO, to really push the barrow out in terms of what you can do to assist veterans.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second, the lapel pin, may be worn to help identify veterans when they aren't wearing their uniform or medals. The veteran lapel pin and reservist lapel pin provide a way for the public to recognise and connect with veterans and acknowledge their service to the nation. The pins will be distributed in the coming months.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The third, the oath, is a commitment of respect to our veterans in addition to the oath traditionally recited on Anzac Day and Remembrance Day. The Australian community is encouraged to pledge the oath at community commemorative events in recognition of our veterans and their families. Veterans will be able to apply for their card, oath and lapel pin via MyService or the department's website. However, it must be acknowledged that we all know we can do more and we should do more.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It should be also acknowledged that the Australian Defence Veterans' Covenant is only part of the government's commitment to putting veterans and their families first. In this year's budget, the government committed to investing more than $11.5 billion in services and support for our 280,000 veterans and their families. As the son, grandson and great-grandson of men who servedâin particular, Dad, who receives support from the government because of his time in the Australian ArmyâI know it is something we gratefully receive. This is a real increase in funding of more than $300 million from last year. This includes funding for veterans' mental health and suicide prevention, funding to support grants for organisations that help veterans to find meaningful employment, funding to extend the Provisional Access to Medical Treatment trial and funding for family violence victims who are former spouses or de facto partners of veterans, amongst other things.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In detailâand I do stress that we know we can always do moreâwe are continuing to fund the largest reform in the Department of Veterans' Affairs' history. This will make it easier and faster for veterans to access the services they need when and where they need them. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are also providing $16.2 million to support veterans' employment. We have seen many great examples of businesses benefiting from the skills and capabilities of the veteran community through the Prime Minister's Veterans' Employment Awards. Nevertheless, we know that there are some veterans transitioning from the ADF who require more support navigating the civilian job market and the ex-service community plays a critical role here. That's why we'll be providing grant funding to organisations across Australia to deliver and expand their innovative programs to assist veterans to find meaningful civilian work. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're also continuing a substantial investment in veterans' mental health and suicide prevention, committing $4 million to provide training for up to 7,000 volunteers to better recognise mental health risks and provide intervention and support. This builds on the nearly $200 million in uncapped mental health support we provide every year, including free mental health care for anyone with a single day of full-time service. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Through the budget, the government has also responded to the concerns of those veterans who have taken antimalarial drugs. The government has responded to the recent Senate inquiry on this matter and has agreed, or agreed in principle, to all of the inquiry's recommendations. As part of this, we've provided $2.1 million to deliver a national program for concerned veterans to undergo comprehensive health assessments to identify any potential service related illnesses, injuries or disease. Also, 225,000 veterans and widows are set to benefit from a one-off energy assistance payment of $75 per single and $125 for couples to assist with the cost of power bills. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We should acknowledge, and Senator Sterle mentioned this in his speech, that we would not be here today without the numerous Defence and ex-service organisations who work tirelessly for veterans and their families. As I said earlier, there are a lot of them. There is no way I can pay homage, thank all of them or name all those individuals who have continued to assist veterans and also continued to help provide counsel and advice to those of us who are fortunate enough to sit in this chamber. Over the past five years I've met with many of them, but some I'd particularly like to mention are: the Defence Force Welfare Association, DFWA; the Queensland Veterans' Advisory Council; Legacy; the RSL; the Alliance of Defence Service Organisations, ADSO; and Mates4Mates. They were very goodâand I won't name those individuals who have made sure that I'm fully aware of their views in relation to different issues that impact upon the covenant and the wider Defence community. I would like to publicly thank them for their patience with me, for their counsel and for all of their work. In particular, I will name someone: I'd like to recognise Graeme Mickelberg, who is chair of the LNP's Defence and Veterans' Affairs Policy Committee, for his tireless advocacy on this issue. Graeme and I have known each other for some time, but we first talked about this issue in the pub at Palmwoods about why this covenant isn't here in Australia and why it should be here based on the covenant's success in the United Kingdom. The covenant has been Liberal National Party policy thanks to Graeme and the efforts of the Defence and veterans' affairs committee. Many party members and many constituents, many who don't support the Liberal National Party, have contacted me and my office about this issue and for that I am grateful. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the beginning of my speech, I made a point of acknowledging those who have served and are serving. One of the things that I find strange in this country is thatâand I raised this issue, I think, a year ago and some people shot me down in flames and some people said it was a good ideaâwhen we board planes, we acknowledge those who have signed up to a frequent-flyer program. We give priority boarding to those who might have joined a frequent-flyer program yet we don't acknowledge those who have served or are serving. My friends say that often it's the small things, when it comes to how you deal with veterans and the community, and it is that simple acknowledgement. So I wrote to the various airlines saying that I can't understand why we can acknowledge frequent flyers but we can't acknowledge those who have served and are serving in the Defence Force. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Likewise, where it's become customary now that we do an acknowledgement of country, I make a point that if we're going to do an acknowledgement of country we should also acknowledge those who have served and are serving. The freedoms that we take for granted in this country come about because of the sacrifices that these men and women have made and will continue to make for us. This Defence Veterans' Covenant and this bill that is before the Senate go some way to that, and I commend the bill to the Senate.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CICCONE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Victoria</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Opposition Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:10</span>):  I'm pleased to rise tonight to speak in favour of the Australian Veterans' Recognition (Putting Veterans and Their Families First) Bill 2019. In particular, I'm grateful to have the opportunity to place on the record my personal gratitude to the many tens of thousands of men and women who have served in our defence forces and who have dedicated their lives to protecting us and our loved ones. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australian Defence Force personnel make enormous sacrifices on our behalf. The nature of their task can often require them to move their families across the country at very short notice. When they are posted on operations overseas, it can be for months at a time or years and requires them to be away from partners and children. How many veterans and serving defence personnel have missed their little one's first steps, their first day at school, sports games and just the simple pleasure of sitting down with a spouse and a cuppa at the end of a very busy day? These are the kinds of little sacrifices we can often forget, and they are made every day by the people who work so hard to keep us safe from those who would seek to do us harm. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd also like to pay tribute to the many community organisations that are helping and supporting veterans in my home state of Victoria. The Returned and Services League of Australia Victoria Branch has been dedicated to providing practical and ongoing support to veterans since 1916. The contribution this organisation makes to our community can't be overstated. Much of their work happens quietly and without fanfare, yet the impact of their efforts can be profound. For example, the RSL was recently responsible for providing a motorised wheelchair for the child of a medically discharged member of the Australian Army. The family of this former soldier was struggling to make ends meet raising four children. When one of the children needed a motorised wheelchair, it was the RSL that stepped in and helped them. To give you another example, when a retired member of the Royal Australian Navy was unable to afford a new pair of glasses, it was the RSL that provided the funds to supplement this, not their support pension. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not just the RSL that does this kind of good work in our community. Soldier On provides social activities, employment, educational support, psychological support and assistance for our veterans, helping them and their families stay connected in the communities that they love. Young Veterans supports former defence personnel with opportunities to create community connections with one another, an important component in the ongoing mental health of our veterans. Then there are the Vietnam Veterans Association, Legacy, Veterans Off The Streets, the War Widows' Guild, the Defence Force Welfare Association and countless others, all of whom are doing their bit to support our veterans and their families. But there's more to be done, and there's a role for everyone in this place and the community to lend a hand. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When the men and women of our Defence Force are on deployment, they are in harm's wayâliterallyâputting their safety and lives on the line for our national interest, sacrificing their physical and mental health for our safety and comfort. We owe our veterans a great debt. As both sides of this place and many on the crossbench recognise, this is a way for us to plan a recognition of veterans and serving members of our Defence Force. It's also why, despite some concerns about the mechanisms of the bill, Labor will support the proposed format for recognition of immense contributions that veterans have made to our community. The centrepiece of this bill is the establishment of an Australian Defence Veterans' Covenant, which will provide a framework for our community to recognise and thank veterans for their service to our nation. It is something for which a range of stakeholders have been lobbying for some time now. This will serve as a solemn reminder of the debt of thanks and service our community owes veterans.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">However, there are concerns that the covenant does not cover currently serving military personnel. Recognition models around the world that are similar to that which would be established by this bill, notably that of the United Kingdom, include currently serving military personnel. As the shadow minister for veterans' affairs, Amanda Rishworth, stated earlier this year when this bill was debated in the other place, 'Our obligation to look after members is just as great when they are serving as it is when they are in transition, through that transition and then while in civilian life.' The member for Kingston is correct. Veterans hold a special place in our community, but so do currently serving members of the defence forces, and we should include them in formal recognition.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I believe that the establishment of the covenant and a formal program of recognition for our veterans is important. Lapel pins and a veterans' card are simple things that we can do to achieve this. But that recognition has to go hand in hand with proper support and assistance through the Department of Veterans' Affairs. Our thanks to and recognition of veterans also have to include proper provision of health care and mental health services. Cutting departmental staff and changing departmental programs in ways that are not yet clear make the provision of that health care and those mental health services harder, not easier. Words are important, but they must be backed up with action. I'm now looking to the government to ensure that the impact of their budget cuts will be minimised at the very least. I am pleased that I've been able to place on the record my gratitude to former and current Defence Force personnel and the many community organisations that support them.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:17</span>):  When you hear the way the rest of these senators talk about the Australian Veterans' Recognition (Putting Veterans and Their Families First) Bill 2019 here, it's as though they're talking about something completely different, because they're all talking about a bill that recognises and respects veterans and their families, and I don't see that anywhere. The bill as written by the government does nothing. It does absolutely nothing. It's designed to mean nothing, it offers nothing, it says nothing and it commits nothing. In the words of one veteran, 'When you've got a mental health condition, you're in a constant battle with yourself, and then DVA makes you battle them as well.' And, for some veterans, it's asking too much; it's one battle too many. They haven't got it in them. There's nothing left, because they're just an empty human shell.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government says that this bill is about recognising and respecting our veterans. Recognising and respecting? You get a pin, you get a card, you get a covenant. You get a bill that falls over itself to say how much we love and respect veterans and their families, how we recognise them and their service and sacrifice, how they're great and they deserve the worldâbut in the meantime, here's a pin.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If you really respected veterans and their families, you wouldn't send them a pin; you would send them an apology. This government has failed veterans each and every time. Veterans fight for usâall of usâand when they come home they fight the Department of Veterans' Affairs. Wow, they've got a lot to look forward to, haven't they! The review into the Department of Veterans' Affairs' handling of compensation claims found that the DVA could actually be harming the mental health of veterans. Imagine going to the department that's there to help you, asking them to help you and coming out the other end worse.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">And there are thousands of us. This isn't rare. This isn't only happening now and then. Nearly three out of four ex-service personnel and ADF members who transition into the Reserve have a mental health condition at some stage in their lifetime. Male veterans under 30 are twice as likely to commit suicide. Between 2014 and 2018 DVA received 10 claims for mental health conditions a day. That is 19,000 mental health condition claims. People are coming back with mental scars that run deep and they are asking for help, because we tell them that's what they should do, because we promised them help, because we care about themâsupposedly. Then we withhold it and we break them. Veterans are killing themselves, and once again you want to send them pins.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's you in the government who send these people to fight, but when they come back you wash your hands of them. This bill doesn't even make a secret of that; you don't even try and hide it. It doesn't fix a single broken system, broken promise or broken veteran. It doesn't even try. What it does, according to the minister, is provide symbolic recognition. This bill is just about making people feel good so you guys in here can have your fuzzy wuzzy moment. Well, I'm not getting the fuzzy wuzzy, I'll be honest with you.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Clause 10 says outright that the bill 'does not create or give rise to rights or obligations'. It clearly states that. In other words, where the bill says the Commonwealth will cooperate with veterans and their family, it's just words. There's no promise. You're not legislating it. There's no promise here. It's a feel-good moment for you all in here. Where the bill says that the Commonwealth will work to resolve veterans' claims quickly, simply and fairly, once again, it's just words. If the government doesn't honour those words, too badâthere is nothing you can do about it. There are no penalties for you people in here, nothing at allâabsolutely nothing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill promises to recognise and respect veterans. Haven't we been doing that forâhow many years now?âover 100? Haven't we been promising to do that with them already? I've heard it time and time and time again. Where the bill says the Commonwealth will cooperate with veterans and families, it's just words; it's not a promise. Where the bill says the Commonwealth will work to resolve veterans' issues, quickly, simply and fairly, it's just words.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill promises to recognise and respect veterans and treat them with dignity and fairness, but this promise isn't legally enforceable. There are no penalties for you people. It says to veterans, 'We promise to treat you right.' Like I said, you've been promising to do that for years; you just don't want to be held to that promise. What a shameful performance in here today! You say, 'We don't want to be held to it, but we'll make promises for you.' If you really wanted to help these veterans, you wouldn't be doing this. This is like a slap in the face to them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What you do is what the Liberals promised in 2004 when the then Minister for Veterans' Affairs promised that the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2004 would be the best of both of the existing schemes. What you'd do is summon all the bigwigs from business, unions, employment agencies and government and lock them in a room and say, 'We're not leaving without a plan to give veterans specific, targeted employment opportunities that are flexible enough to let veterans work and still receive treatment.' You'd push the Insurance Council of Australia to stop its members from deducting fees for TPD people, total and permanently disabled people, and you'd encourage income protection policies for veterans returning to work. I haven't heard of any of you trying to do that. I haven't heard of any of you trying to take the Insurance Council of Australia on. How's that goodwill going in here? These policies are absolutely worthless.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Veterans who try to claim after going from service to civilian employment are told they can't claim against their policies if a complaint relates to their service, because it's pre-existing or war caused. If you really want to help veterans, you'd grant veterans with operational war service a gold card for life. You're not doing any of that. You're giving veterans another card to go in the wallet, another pin to go on the jacket, another promise to be broken as soon as it costs you something to keep it. Also, you can pat yourselves on the back and make yourselves feel good.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm moving amendments that are going to be voted down by the government because the purpose of this bill, according to the Liberal Party and according to the National Party, is pure symbolism. That's all it is: symbolism. The Liberal Party don't want to be held to a lifetime of dealing with the claims of veterans, because that would cost them too much to actually deliver. Apparently pins are a cheaper solution. The Nationals don't want my amendments to succeed either. The Nationals will only vote for this bill if it means they get to say they support veterans without ever having to do a thing to actually support them. They will vote against committing the Commonwealth to an ambition to treat veterans better than the way they're being treated right now. They say this bill isn't about changing things; it's about symbolism. It's not about what it means, because, without my amendments, none of this means absolutely anything. It's all about how this looks. I'm not here to make you look goodâI'll be honestâespecially when it comes to veterans. I'm not here to support a veterans bill that doesn't support veterans. I won't do that.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In 1917, Prime Minister Billy Hughes said:</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">... the care of the returned soldier is one of the functions of the Commonwealth Government ...  They go out to fight our battles. We say to them: 'When you come back we will look after you'â¦</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">That says something more solemn and profound and comprehensive than anything you can fix in this excuse of a bill, and it says it in five words. It says, 'We will look after you.' That's what you're supposed to be doing, but, no, you want to symbolise. This bill doesn't say that, does it? It doesn't respect veterans. This bill doesn't recognise their service and their sacrifice. You are kidding yourselves. It is absolutely embarrassing right now, in this chamber, to be aiming this low. Just say you'll look after them and bind yourself to it. Set that standard for yourselves and work like dogs to live up to it. If you fail to meet the standard that respect and recognition actually demands, own that failure. Own it; be honest. There's honour in trying to treat every veteran like a hero instead of a cheat. There's no honour in this bill. You're walking away from your side of the deal before you're even asked to honour it. They were sent to fight for us and we should show a bit of fight for them. That's how you show respect. So you know what you can do with your pins. I'll be honest with you.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have a bit of time here. This is good. I just want to talk about something in clause 7. Apparently existing veterans legislation already requires DVA to act essentially in accordance with equity, good conscience and the substantial merits of the claim without regard to legal technicality. This clause is about applying the legislation beneficially. There have been a number of Senate reviews, including the constant battle, and recommendations quite clearly articulate the failure of DVA to undertake its existing legislative function. So why does this bill need to again remind them that they will have to practise the act accordingly? Why? I'll tell you. You're not doing anything here.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to give you a case. This is very disturbing, and this has happened in the last 12 months, and apparently we're fixing the system. I'm going to bring this case up. I want to talk about a 94-year-old war veteran fighting to get a VEA-EDA pension through the AATâwith DVA using their usual lawyers to take us all downâand being forced to see four medical specialists and give evidence before the AAT. That's right: a 94-year-old veteran. But you're changing your ways! Hang on, it gets better. It gets good here; it gets better. Do you know why? Because DVA did not accept his own lifestyle self-assessmentâa 94-year-old man.</span>

                    </a>  I just want to go on about the goodwill that we've got going on here and, of course, the goodwill of Veterans' Affairs as per usualâI don't see much goodwill coming out of them at all. But I want to talk about the case of a 94-year-old World War II veteran fighting to get an EDA pension through the AAT with DVA using their usual lawyers. Imagine using lawyers against a 94-year-old and forcing him to see four medical specialistsâonce again, a 94-year-old seeing four medical specialistsâand then expecting him to give evidence before the AAT. And why? Because DVA did not accept his lifestyle self-assessmentâa 94-year-old doing a self-assessment. This just keeps getting better. This is not the old DVA but occurred throughout 2018, and the AAT decision was handed down in May 2019. Imagine putting that World War II veteran through so much trauma at 94 years of age, and they were doing that while they were shaping this bill of their goodwill. So, honestly, we have to ask the questions. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also noticed that Senator McGrath brought up the DFWAâand I thank you for bringing up the DFWA, because apparently you're not listening to the DFWA. The DFWA, Defence Force Welfare Association, has made very, very strong representations to amend the title to more specifically identify its intent besides its intent to give us a card and some sort of pin and to have a no-disadvantage clause inserted in the legislation. Indeed, when the FADT committee reviewed the bill, the Defence Force Welfare Association made a submission for the inclusion of such a clause but, of course, guess who opposed it? Veterans' Affairs. It took the view that Veterans' Affairs-related legislation was beneficial to ex-serving ADF members anyway and that, as the bill was not about additional benefits, there was no need for a no-disadvantage clause. I actually thought that was a fair ask: no disadvantage to be brought to the veteran. It's not a big ask because we have all this goodwill, and you would not want this or any other bill to disadvantage a veteranâjust one word: disadvantage. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Veterans and their families are affected by other legislation practices which sometimes have had unintended consequences. Oh, my goodness! The Department of Veterans' Affairs is full of those unintended consequences but, instead of cleaning up those unintended consequences, it's just let them sit. That's why it's such a dirty, sticking rotten mummy. You don't fix it; you just put bandaid over bandaid over bandaid. This is why we're in the situation that we're in now. This is why you are losing lives within the Department of Veterans' Affairs, because your decision-making is out of control. That's if you are making decisions. This is what is taking their lives. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I can tell you now: you have had review after review after review. You've had recommendations which you have not bothered with. You've just put whatever you thought was going to fix the Department of Veterans' Affairs without actually looking at all these review systems, and it is absolutely shocking. It would be nice if you actually started to listen to what was going on. So, let's have a look at these. You've had Enzyme reports. You've had forums. You've had the chronology of other reports since 2009 related to transition of ADF personnel. You've had an Australian Institute of Health and Welfare study into the suicides of serving and ex-serving ADF personnel. You've had an Australian National Audit Office report on the administration of rehabilitation services under MRCA. You've had an inquiry of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade into the care of ADF personnel wounded and injured during operations. Oh, wait! It goes on. It keeps getting better! You've had all these reviews. You've had all these workshops. Are you actually listening? I would have thought if you were listening after all those reviews this Department of Veterans' Affairs should be tickety-boo, but it is actually worse than what it ever has been.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've sat on the fence with the royal commission in the Department of Veterans' AffairsâI really have. It is getting to the point where you've now got inquiries going on in other states because of suicides, because the DVA, with their own hand, have caused those. That, to me, is very worrying. I don't think you're learning anything in here. There are also a lot of people out there that have not been able to function, who have PTSD, so they not only have psychological injuries but have physical injuries as well. They've got no idea these inquiries are going on. You're not exactly broadcasting them all over. There's a bit of smoke and mirrors going on. I can tell you now they haven't had their chance to have their say, and part of the healing process for those veterans will be to be able to have their say.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm going to see what happens in here over the next six months. But I'm telling you now I am leaning towards supporting those calling for a royal commission, and that support is getting bigger. If I get on the train about that, especially on my social media, you will have no other choice but to call a royal commission on the Department of Veterans' Affairs, because it's failed to do its job. Doing all these little niceties here and giving us a pin is not going to fix the physical and psychological conditions of these veterans and those who have served. That's not what they're asking for. They're asking for what you have promised them for a hundred years, and that is to look after them when they return. They are not getting that from in here, so either we don't have the capability to fix the system or something is terribly, terribly wrong. I tell you what: I've had enough of the suicides. So have they and so have their families and so have their friends. It is beyond the point of return. For goodness sake, to us this is a slap in the faceâthis whole card and, 'I'll get up and ask questions about that.' It's a nice feeling, but it's not fixing anything. It's all smoke and mirrors. Anyway, I'll leave the rest of what I have to say and the questions until the committee.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:38</span>):  I rise today to add my contribution in support of the Australian Veterans' Recognition (Putting Veterans and Their Families First) Bill 2019. This bill will enshrine in legislation the Australian Defence Veterans' Covenant. The covenant will help recognise and acknowledge the unique nature of military service as well as the sacrifices our veterans have made in defence of our great country, whether that is overseas on operations or here at home as part of the Army Aboriginal Community Assistance Program, as a member of the catering corps feeding our troops, as a member keeping our aircraft in the air or as a driver transporting stores and equipment across Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The covenant also recognises the unique sacrifices that families make to support and assist their loved ones. As mentioned, the purpose of the covenant is to acknowledge the unique nature of military service, particularly the sacrifice demanded of those who commit to defend our nation and their families. The Australian Defence Veterans' Covenant is an oath that the parliament of Australia endorses on behalf of the people of Australia and reads:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We, the people of Australia, respect and give thanks to all who have served in our defence force and their families.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We acknowledge the unique nature of military service and the sacrifice demanded of all who commit to defend our nation.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">We undertake to preserve the memory and deeds of all who have served and promise to welcome, embrace, and support all military veterans as respected and valued members of our community.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">For what they have done, this we will do.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This oath is not intended to replace the ode that is traditionally recited on Anzac Day or Remembrance Day, but it is an additional commitment of our respect for veterans. I would like to take this opportunity to personally thank our veterans and their families for their service and sacrifice. It is thanks to them that we are able to rise in this chamber to discuss and debate legislation. Without their sacrifice, who knows what type of democracy we might have?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Further to the veterans' covenant, this bill also includes a veterans' recognition program, something I am personally very pleased to see introduced. This veterans' recognition program supports the covenant by providing a new veterans' card, veterans' lapel pin and oath. These provide a way for Australians to identify and acknowledge our veterans for their service on any day of the year, not just on Anzac Day or Remembrance Day. As a country, we should be remembering and acknowledging the service and sacrifice our veterans make each and every day.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A veterans' recognition program provides a way for all Australians to support our veterans. It allows businesses and other organisations to offer discounts, benefits or concessions to our veterans when they present the veterans' card or are wearing their lapel pin. The veteran lapel pin and reservist lapel pin provide a way for the public to recognise and connect with veterans and acknowledge their service to the nation. The pins will help identify veterans when they aren't wearing their uniforms or medals and will be distributed in the coming months.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to stress that the pins do not seek to replace the returned from active service badge and operational service badges. The returned from active service badge recognises Australian Defence Force members who have returned from active or warlike service during military campaigns in operational areas. The operational service badge recognises all declared operational service, such as border protection, service in the Greater Middle East area or other operations. I strongly encourage any business who would like to be involved in this veterans' recognition program to go to the Department of Veterans' Affairs' website and register their interest in being part of this exciting program. By doing so, they will receive an information pack, which will then help them support and connect with the veteran community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would just like to comment on the contribution made earlier by one of the senators on the opposite side of the chamber, where they stated this bill doesn't include current serving members of the Australian Defence Force. I will clarify that, as in the definitions included in part 1 of the bill, veteran means:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">â¦ a person who has served, or is serving, as a member of the Permanent Forces or as a member of the Reserves.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition Morrison government puts our veterans and their families first. In the budget announced earlier this year, the government increased funding to the Department of Veterans' Affairs by $300 million. We are strengthening the support for our veterans with $24.4 million in funding for a range of programs, such as extending the trial of the provisional access to medical treatment. This is a fantastic initiative that allows our veterans to access treatment for a range of specified medical conditions whilst their DVA claims are being assessed. This allows faster access to medical treatment and helps prevent further deterioration of their health condition.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are providing $4 million in funding to provide training to RSL and other ex-service organisation volunteers, who, as we know, work closely with and offer assistance to our veterans. This training will help them to recognise people at risk and, where appropriate, provide intervention and referral for additional support. The coalition government is providing grants to not-for-profit organisations to help them deliver programs that will assist veterans to find employment post discharge from Defence. The many new and amended listings being made to the Repatriation Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme also offer support and assistance to our veterans.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All of these initiatives add to the previous work the coalition government has done for veterans over the past few years, such as reducing red tape in the DVA claims process by streamlining the requirements for certain conditions. If a veteran's doctor diagnoses one of the streamlined conditions, DVA can accept it as service related. This results in less paperwork and a reduced processing time. It is a much more client-focused model, easing some of the stress placed on veterans in submitting their claims to DVA. We are also introducing non-liability health care, which allows current and former Defence members, depending on eligibility, to receive treatment for any mental health condition, cancer, malignant neoplasm and pulmonary tuberculosis without the need for the condition to be accepted as service related. Once again, it's a more client-focused model, easing stress on our veterans.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Support and counselling is also available for veterans and their families through Open ArmsâVeterans and Families Counselling Service. It provides free and confidential counselling, group treatment programs and suicide prevention to help our current serving defence members, our veterans and their families. Open Arms has experienced counsellors who have undertaken specific training to help them understand the unique demands of military life and to help members, veterans and their families transition and adjust to civilian life after military service. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the past two or three years the Department of Veterans' Affairs has refocused. No longer are they claims-process drivenârather, they now put the veteran at the centre of every decision they make. This has been supported by the coalition government's investment in the Veteran Centric Reform, focused, as its name suggests, on putting the veterans and their families first. The Department of Veterans' Affairs has been in existence for over 100 years. As a result, and as you can well imagine, some of the systems and services have needed to be updated to bring it into the modern era. This has included putting a focus on improving the digital aspect of delivery. MyService has been introduced to allow some claims to be done and certain services to be available via online servicing. Telephone access, which has been in existence for some years, needed to be upgraded and, through the introduction of the Veteran Centric Reform, improved technology has made it much faster and easier to speak to the department. This has been enhanced through the single contact number of 1800VETERAN. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Department of Veterans' Affairs has worked in partnership with the Department of Human Services on many service delivery aspects, including the expansion of face-to-face services in some locations, particularly rural and regional areas. There has also been an improvement in data and system capabilities. Investment in computer systems has certainly provided faster and far more accurate access to veterans' records. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The majority of veterans who leave the Defence Force go on to have successful careers, and another recently introduced development for veterans has been the Prime Minister's Veterans' Employment Program. This program demonstrates the importance the government places on raising awareness with employers, in both the private and the public sector, of the value and unique experience of our veterans. The Australian Defence Force invests heavily in its service men and women, who have a broad range of skills and experience developed through their careers. Their skill sets, including leadership and problem-solving skills, are in strong demand and will obviously transfer into civilian and public life. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australian businesses of all sizes and across all industries have an opportunity to employ these skilled and capable individuals when they leave Defence. By making businesses more aware of the value veterans bring to their organisations, employment opportunities for veterans will increase. As a result of that, the introduction of the Prime Minister's Veterans' Employment Awards has also provided some wonderful examples where businesses have benefited through employing veterans. It provides an opportunity to celebrate veterans in the civilian workforce, such as those who were successful in the 2019 awards. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to pass on my congratulations to these following award winners: Outstanding Contribution by an Individual to Veterans' Employment, Mr Chris Mayfield OAM; Outstanding Veterans' Employer of the Year, BCT Solutions; Veterans Employer of the YearâLarge, Boral Limited; Veterans' Employer of the YearâMedium, BCT Solutions; Veterans' Employer of the YearâSmall Business, Veterans in Construction; Veteran Employee of the Year, Mr Jordan Ivone; and Veteran Entrepreneur of the Year, Mr Ben Whitham. Supporting the spouses of our veterans was Excellence in Supporting Spouse Employment, Defence Bank; and Excellence in Supporting Veterans' Employment was Ironside Recruitment. They are all worthy and successful winners.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another area of support provided to our veterans by DVA is the significant recognition of their service through a number of national services, mostly coordinated through DVA. These include many Anzac Day and Remembrance Day services around the country and things such as the significant program of events commemorating the Anzac centenary, during the period 2014 to 2018. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">By acknowledging those who fought in the First World War, we also acknowledge all those who have served since. It was a great honour for me to be able to be present and attend the Centenary of the Battle of Polygon Wood in Belgium in 2017. That battle took place on 26 September 1917 as the men of the 5th Australian Division prepared for their first major battle in Belgium. The sombre mood of that service and the immense sacrifice of Australians at that place still stays with me today. The Australian people and everyone in this chamber recognise the sacrifice and commitment of those who have signed up for service and made an oath or affirmation to defend Australia. This bill further cements Australia's gratitude for their service. I urge all senators in this chamber to support this bill.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="282997" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SCARR</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:50</span>):  I should first note that this is not my first speech. I'd like to commence by commending the senators who have made contributions to this debate on this bill, the Australian Veterans' Recognition (Putting Veterans and Their Families First) Bill 2019, thus far. I have genuinely been interested and listened to their contributions to this debate. In particular I'd mention the passionate speech that was given by Senator Lambie. Obviously she holds these issues close to her heart. I think she made a great contribution to the debate here tonight, and I commend her for it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Listening to those contributions I was reminded of a quote from one of the great Russian writers, Dostoevsky, who said in his workâit was either <span style="font-style:italic;">Crime and Punishment</span> or <span style="font-style:italic;">The Brothers Karamazov</span>â'Judge a society by the way they treat their prisoners.' That is, if you go into the prisons in a society and see how that society treats its prisoners, then you can make an assessment as to the humanity of the society I think perhaps we could take those words and adjust them to this case and say, 'Judge our countryâjudge Australiaâby the way we treat our veterans and their families,' because there is no more special class of citizen in our society than those who have served our country in the armed forces.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Earlier today I made a contribution to the debate with respect to maritime borders in Timor-Leste. In that contribution I referred to the service that has been given by a number of my friends and people I've gotten to know over the years in that field and in particular during the time of the troubles in East Timor. My friend and colleague Senator James McGrath referred to the contribution of Graeme Mickelberg, who is an outstanding veteran himself and has made an outstanding contribution to this debate and to the discussion of the covenant. His son, Brent Mickelberg, is a member for the state seat of Buderim. Brent himself served in the Australian infantry, just as his father did. When he gave his maiden speech to the Legislative Assembly in Queensland, Brent Mickelberg, the member for Buderim, made a great contribution to the understanding of Queenslanders as to what veterans go throughâthe contribution and the sacrifices they make. I want to quote from his maiden speech: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I cannot speak in detail about my service over in Afghanistan, but some of the things that we saw will stay with me for life: images of children killed by the Taliban, suicide bomb attacks and US soldiers killed by the Afghan soldiers they had been mentoring.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Brent then went on to describe the troubles he had upon returning to Australia and the struggles he had adjusting to that. He described how:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">On a drive from Cairns to Townsville one night with my sister I recall seeing movement on the side of the road. It clearly triggered something and I swerved violently in reaction. To tell you the truth, I had not even realised what had happened or how I had reacted until Katie told me to pull over.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">He was suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder. It got so bad. Brent said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Over time I began to wonder if I would be better off ending my life so that I would not be a burden to Anna and my family. I felt that I was not doing anything to make their lives better anyway.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So here is a great Australian who had given service to our beautiful country and was left in a dark place of desperation following his service for our country. But he told his story. He recovered. He sought treatment from a psychologist who specialised in returned veterans and police, got treatment for his post-traumatic stress disorder and worked through it. He had the bravery and the courage to refer to his own personal struggle. In his words, he said it was 'not only to spread awareness about the danger of PTSD for our Defence and emergency services personnel but also because too few men are willing to stand up and tell their stories of struggling with mental health. I want my son to grow up knowing that he should not be afraid to seek help if he ever needs it.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those are the peopleâthe Brent Mickelbergs of the world and of this countryâwhom we are here respecting this evening in terms of this debate. Those are the people whom we must keep at the forefront of our minds, and it is those people and their families who should never be let down by whatever government forms in this place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to talk about the unique nature of defence service. Senator Lambie referred to the Defence Force Welfare Association and a submission they made. I want to quote from that submission in terms of informing the Senate as to: how is military service unique? How is it unique from the police, the fire service, the ambulance service and others who put themselves in harm's way? We know the great courage and bravery that they show. What is unique about military service in addition to the sacrifice? I'd like to quote from their submission because I think it encapsulates the concept of uniqueness extremely well. They said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">In examining military service as a unique calling we should understand that exposure to danger and the courage to face it are of themselves not unique features of military service. In arguing our case, we do not maintain that the serviceman has a higher requirement to show courage, nor a greater willingness to make sacrificesâeven of his lifeâthan others who serve the society and protect it from danger. We claim only for the servicemanâ</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">

                  <span class="HPS-Small">a distinction from all other callings, in that he and he aloneâ</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's the compulsion, and therein lies the uniqueness of military service. Subsequently, in the submission from the Defence Force Welfare Association, it says:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">... once the individual has entered military service, the relationship of obedience is established. This relationship necessarily requires the surrender of the individual's "inalienable" right to liberty, and alienates his right to life and security of the person, by placing responsibility for their preservation in the hands of others.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xD;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xD;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, that is where the uniqueness lies in terms of military service.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to take on board Senator Lambie's point with respect to the no-disadvantage test. I note clause 7 refers to the beneficial interpretation of legislation. It refers to three pieces of legislation and instruments which are made under those actsâin particular, the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986; the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 2004; the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation (Defence-related Claims) Act 1988; and also instruments made under those acts. It is important that we actually read these words and reflect on what it means in the cases that come before the relevant decision-makers. Subclause 7.2 states:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">(2)  The Commonwealth is committed to decision-makers deciding claims under that legislation:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Â Â Â (a)  in a manner that is fair, just and consistent; and</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Â Â Â (b)  within a time that is proportionate to the complexity of the matter; and</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Â Â Â (c)  in a manner that promotes public trust and confidence; and</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Â Â Â (d)  on the basis of only requiring evidence sufficient to meet the relevant standard of proof for the claims.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would hope that all decision-makers, when they're considering matters related to veterans, have extremely close regard to subclause 7.2. Again, on the way decisions on claims should be made, it says:</span>

Many of our largest companies in this country have policies which promote diversity. They should have policies that promote diversity; there is no question about that. I suggest that those companies reflect on their policies and find room in their policies for veterans, recognising that consideration should be given to employing veterans. They should put that in their diversity policies and their employment policies, and they should discuss what practical measures could be taken to assist in the employment of our veterans.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CHANDLER</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tasmania</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:03</span>):  In rising to speak today on this bill, I wish to first and foremost express my continued thanks and gratitude to Australia's veterans community for their tireless service to our country. As I'm sure honourable members have heard tonight, this bill is about putting veterans first, putting veterans' families first and recognising the unique and special service that veterans provide in defending our country. I think that we not only need to recognise their service but also understand the impact that that service has on both the lives of veterans and the lives of their families. I certainly hope this bill will go some way to making life easier for them as they adjust to life following their valued service.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In rising here tonight, I wish to speak first and foremost about my personal experiencesâbe they second-handâof people I might know or have heard of who come from Tasmania and about why I personally think that this is a bill that deserves wholehearted support. Tasmania, the state I come from, like all Australian states and territories, has a strong history of military service. Currently there are more than 10,000 veterans living in Tasmania. Indeed, Australia's last surviving soldier from the Gallipoli campaign was a Tasmanian. His name was Alec Campbell. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Alec joined the Australian Army at the age of just 16 and was said to be nicknamed 'The Kid' by his fellow servicemen in Hobart because, at the time of his training, he was still too young to shave. Of course, the Alec Campbell I know is the one who was still attending Anzac Day marches in my lifetime, who still had youthful enthusiasm despite seeing some undeniably terrible things. There's something quite profound in me being a young girl attending Anzac Day marches and thinking: 'What would I have done if I'd been in Alec's situation? Would I have been brave enough to put my hand up to fight for my country?' Those are questions that I dwell on every Anzac Dayâor more regularly than that. Being a young person growing up at a time when Alec was still alive in Hobart and was attending Anzac Day parades at the same time I was, one can't help but meditate on that for a moment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Speaking of Tasmania's young war heroes, 14 of Australia's 100 Victoria Cross recipients are Tasmanian. Given the nature and aim of this bill today to appropriately recognise the contribution of our veterans, it would be remiss of me to not mention Ordinary Seaman Edwardâor, as he was known, TeddyâSheean. Teddy Sheean was a Tasmanian World War II hero and one of our best-known wartime servicemen in Tasmania, perhaps second only to Alec Campbell for being our last living Gallipoli veteran. On 1 December 1942, when Teddy was 18 years old, the ship on which he was serving, the HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Armi</span><span style="font-style:italic;">dale</span>, sank as a result of enemy attack. As the ship went down, Teddy continued to defend his fellow shipmates, firing at the enemy while at the same time surely knowing that his own life was soon to end on that ship as it sank. Efforts are currently underway in Tasmania, led by former senator for Tasmania and now Minister of Veterans' Affairs in the Tasmanian state government, Guy Barnett, to ensure that Teddy Sheean is appropriately recognised for his heroism on that fateful day in 1942. I have heard Minister Barnett speak on this topic very regularly. I'm always taken aback by the passion with which he speaks of the need for us to recognise Teddy Sheean. It's that same need that we bring to this bill todayâa need to recognise our veterans for the contribution that they have made.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am quite fortunate in that not too many of my immediate family have been caught up in the perils of war, except my great-grandfather John Henry Beard of Oatlandsâwho I never met, but I did meet his wife, my great-grandmother. John Beard went to war in his 30s. He fought in World War I at quite an old age, particularly in comparison to, for example, Alec Campbell. My mother, who was alive when my great-grandfather still was, tells the story of when I asked her: 'What experiences did my great-grandfather share with you? Was war something that was talked about around the dinner table? Was it something that, on every Anzac Day, you all came together and celebrated?' My mother said no. There was an understanding or an acceptance in the family that the war had greatly affected my great-grandfather. He was suffering from shell shock and a few residual wounds from that time. My mother was instructed, 'Don't ask. It's not a chapter of his life that he wants to relive and so if you are respectful of the service that he made then you won't ask him about it.' I raise that tonight not because I think we're doing the wrong thing in recognising our veteransâI certainly don'tâbut because I think it is an important step for this government to take, to say that we need to support veterans' families, like my great-grandfather's family 50-odd years ago, to be able to make peace with what has happened, to be able to talk about it publicly, to celebrate it, if that's what's appropriate, and to commemorate itâagain, if that's what's appropriate. Looking back at my mother's stories of speaking with my great-grandfather, it certainly appears that he didn't feel supported in sharing his stories, whether that was because they were too traumatic for him to deal with or because he didn't feel that it was appropriate to share those stories with his family. Being an inquiring sort of person, I certainly would have relished the opportunity to sit down and talk with my great-grandfather, had our lives overlapped, about his experiences of war. But, as I said, it wasn't something that was really spoken about.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm very honoured tonight to be speaking on this bill to ensure that we can make life just that little bit easier for our veterans, because I don't think that any of our veterans should feel that they can't share their stories, or that they're not supported to share their stories because their community doesn't understand the sacrifices that they have made in serving our country. I have a number of friends who have seen active military service or have been in the reserves. I'm not going to name them here today, because I don't think that would be appropriate, but I see two key things in them. One is the pride that they have for their country and the drive that they have in doing what they do, particularly my friends who have joined the reserves. I say: what compelled you to do this? And they all say that they're proud Australians and they want the opportunity to serve their country in whatever small way, even if that is just in a volunteer capacity. With those that do see active service, I look at the families around them, and I think the support network those families provide is just incredible. I'm very happy that the bill that we're discussing here tonight, the Australian Veterans' Recognition (Putting Veterans and Their Families First) Bill 2019, will go some way towards making life for those families easier, as well as for the veterans.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's not beat around the bush: war is not an enjoyable thing to experience. Growing up when I did, I consider myself very fortunate that I haven't experienced war firsthand. That is no doubt due to the tireless efforts of our veterans looking after our interests overseas, and I'm very thankful to them. But I have some friends who have family members or spouses or friends who have served overseas, and that has had a profound impact on them. I'm very happy not only for the veterans but also for their families and all of the work that they do in supporting veterans to ensure that their contributions to Australia are recognised. That's why I'm very excited to be talking about this bill tonight, and all that it will entail in recognising veterans and their families. I think, particularly, the covenant of Australian Defence veteransâwhich we heard a lot about from my colleague Senator Scarr earlierârepresents a really important step in solidifying our relationship with the veterans community and in recognising the work that they do. It's good to see that the covenant will be supported by a veterans recognition program, which will include a veterans card, a lapel pin and an oath. I was researching this tonight and thinking about the lapel pin and what a small thing that represents but, at the same time, that it will enable everyday people like me, walking down the street, to recognise those veterans who might have served and protected our interests overseas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Walking down the street, I often think that anyone standing in the vicinity could be a veteran, could have fought for our country, and how am I meant to know who I should thank? Because, as I think I've reflected here tonight, I certainly am thankful for the sacrifice that these people make. Something as simple as a pin could be an indicator. I know in Tasmania I often see our Legacy families wearing pins and, again, it's such a simple way to demonstrate that. I understand that some people may not want to wear a pin if they don't feel comfortable with one, but it's about breaking down those barriers and helping the broader community understand and identify veterans and the sacrifices that they have made for their country, if they so wish. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The veterans card will also make it easier for Australians to recognise and respect the contribution that veterans have made to Australia. The veterans card, which is a redesign of the white and gold healthcare cards, will be acknowledged by businesses, and healthcare and service providers. I hope, again, that it'll go some way towards making life easier for our veterans. And, of course, we will continue to provide access to health services and benefits to cardholders as well as concessions, as relevant. I think these are certainly well deserved for the reasons that I've outlined tonight. Our veterans make a significant sacrifice for our country, and we should be thankful in that regard and I think this card will go a long way to demonstrating that. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think I have set out what drives and motivates me to care so deeply for veterans affairs in rising to speak on this bill tonight. Like I said, I come from a state that has a long history of military service. Through regularly attending Anzac Day services and Remembrance Day services over many years, and looking at the people around me, I've continually reflected on what I would do if I were in their situation; and how I would want to be recognised. While I don't think I would be very brave on the battlefield, I certainly think that, if I were, I would somehow want to have those barriers pulled down between me and the people who haven't necessarily experienced what I had and be able to talk about it, to have those conversations and tell stories of my experiences of war or in active service. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Anything that we as a parliament can do to ensure that those barriers are pulled down to make it easier for people to recognise veterans and make veterans feel more supportedâand provide additional support to their familiesâso that they can feel equipped to have the conversations with their families about what they've experienced, is incredibly important work for us to be doing. I know it's getting quite late in the evening, but this is a very important debate for us to be having. And, as I've said a couple of times over the last little while, it's an honour for me to be speaking on this issue tonight.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:18</span>):  My ears pricked up when Senator Chandler talked about Teddy Sheean. Of course, he shares company with some pretty good people: Vice Admiral Collins, Rear Admiral Farncomb, Captain Waller, Captain Dechaineux and Lieutenant Commander Rankin. Of course, they are also the names of five of our submarines, and Teddy Sheehan bears the name of the lastâor in fact the fifth one in the series. But he is noted amongst submariners because in fact he was an ordinary seaman, and I think that serves as a great testimony to Ordinary Seaman Edward Sheean. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to speak just very briefly to the Australian Veterans' Recognition (Putting Veterans and Their Families First) Bill 2019. The bill will create a framework for government and businesses to recognise and acknowledge the unique nature of military service, and to support veterans and their families, which, of course, Centre Alliance recognises is an important aspect of veterans' wellbeing and indeed of Australian culture. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill sets out to achieve this by enshrining the Australian Defence Veterans' Covenant in legislation; by confirming that veterans laws should be interpreted for the benefit of the veteran; and, finally, by providing for the issuing of pins, cards and other artefacts. The pins are to be made in Australia from Australian materials. The new veterans card is a rebadging of the DVA health card and will provide an opportunity for businesses to offer discounts. Naturally, this is at the discretion of Australian businesses. However, the South Australian based company Australian Partners of Defenceâwho have been operating for six years and have secured over 10,000 partnership agreements with some of the largest businesses in Australiaâin partnership with DVA, will be facilitating the offer of discounts and benefits available to veterans via the veterans card.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill, however, is predominantly symbolic in nature. While it is a gesture that demonstrates the reverence Australians have for those who have served or are prepared to serve in the Australian Defence Force, it is only symbolic. But it is a start, something that can be built on over time and something I encourage the department and the government to strongly consider during this 46th Parliament.</span>

                    <a href="30484" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BROCKMAN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Government Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:21</span>):  I rise tonight to make a brief contribution on this Australian Veterans' Recognition (Putting Veterans and Their Families First) Bill. I wasn't planning to make a contribution. It was hearing Senator Lambie's contribution, actually, that made me decide to speak. I absolutely respect Senator Lambie's service to this nation and the contribution she made, and there is something that happened to me which I wish to describe to the Senate. In essence, this bill is about respect and recognition, Senator Lambie, and respect and recognition are very important to service men and women, and very important to their families, and that's why I wish to describe something that happened to me relatively recently, on becoming a senator for Western Australia. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a somewhat convoluted story, but it started with a letter to the editor in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Canberra Times</span>. The letter was from a woman who lived in Western Australia, and she wanted a poppy put in the wall of remembrance to acknowledge the 100th anniversary of her grandfather's death. Obviously, as she was based in Western Australia, she couldn't get to Canberra herself, so she put that letter to the editor in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Canberra Times</span>, asking if there was anyone in Canberra who could perhaps go to the wall of remembrance on the 100th anniversary of his death and place a poppy there.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">How did I get involved as a relatively new senator? Someone living in Canberra who was a former colleague and a friend of my wife's happened to see that letter and happened to be researching her own grandfather's service in World War I, service that was based out of Western Australia as well. Having got her grandfather's records, my wife's friend realised that her grandfather and the grandfather of the woman who had put the letter in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Canberra Times</span> had served together. They'd trained together at Blackboy Hill, which was a training camp in Western Australia, before shipping out to the battlefields. My wife's friend also realised that their commanding officer was Edmund Drake-Brockman, a relative of mineâa great-great-uncle. The Drake-Brockman and Brockman families are very closely related. My great-great-uncle had been the commanding officer of her grandfather and of the deceased service person who the woman was seeking recognition of on the 100th anniversary of his death.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst this chain of events is not unusual in Australiaâwe all know that there is only one or two degrees of separation between anyoneâit was a great honour for me as a newly selected senator for Western Australia at that point to be able to organise for someone in Canberra to place a poppy in the wall of remembrance on the 100th anniversary of that serviceman's death. It meant a lot to the family involved. But I think this is the nicest part of this story. I got a staffer in this buildingâPhilippa Campbell, who many on this side would knowâto take a poppy to the wall of remembrance. She found on that day 10 poppies in the wall of remembrance. Ten poppies had been taken there by people in Canberra who had read that letter in <span style="font-style:italic;">The Canberra Times</span><span style="font-style:italic;">. </span>They had of their own volition gone to the wall of remembrance on that day to honour the wishes of the grandchild of a deceased veteran.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I say again: respect and recognition are important. They are an important part of what we do for our veterans. I think that it is important to remember that, when we honour our veterans in many different ways, it is to say thank you for the service that they have provided to the nation and to say thank you to their families for the service that they have provided to this nation. It's a very important part of what we do as a government. It's not the only thing, though. As I have talked about in this place before, it's easy to single out one thing that the government are doing and try to criticise it and to pretend that that one thing we are doing is reflective of all we are doing. That is clearly not the case in this space.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australian veterans are a focus of this government. We will continue to see an improvement in support and services for veterans, including through the $11.5 billion in funding allocated in the 2019-20 budget. This funding represents an overall increase of $300 million allocated to the Department of Veterans' Affairs, the DVA, in 2019-20 compared to 2018-19, to support our veterans and their families. The 2019-20 budget is focused on putting veterans and their families first and continues to see investment designed to transform the DVA. I think everyone knows that there have been failings in the past. This government is committed to continuing to improve that level of service and continuing to improve that level of support for all of our veterans. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to make it easier and quicker for veterans to access the services that they need. The minister has made very clear that this is a top priority for them. It includes really basic thingsâand, yes, they are basic. The 1800VETERAN line, introducing a single contact phone number, is a very simple but very effective way to ensure that our veterans right across Australia have straightforward, easy access to the services and supports that they require. Every veteran, no matter where they live, should have better access to the DVA. This is being achieved through partnering with the Department of Human Services. The Department of Human Services obviously has a very large footprint across Australia, and, by giving veterans access to those services through the Department of Human Services, we take the supports that the veterans want and need to more places and make them more easy to access.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are also going to be an agent network and mobile service centres. There's investment in making sure that online claims processing is more straightforward and simplified and that veterans can access the information and services they require online. Again, this is a very important change in the way people are accessing their services. It is something that veterans have asked for, and it is something that the government is, again, delivering on. A one-off energy assistance payment will be provided to more than 225,000 veterans and widows who receive support paymentsâa payment worth $75 for singles and $125 for couples.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is all focused on one very simple thing, something that many of my colleagues have said tonight, and that is about putting veterans first; it's about putting veterans' families first. That is why we as a government are continuing to invest in the veterans community and their families. We continue to provide the services that veterans need, that they want and that we continue to develop and supplyâagain, $11.5 billion in services and support, relied on by 280,000 veterans and their families. They are a significant part of the Australian community and a very important part, and one that this nation relies on in the toughest of times. It's certainly true that when we think of our veterans we think about the extraordinary contribution they have made in so many different ways. Earlier today I spoke about Timor-Leste, and we all know of the extraordinary service that our serving men and women at that time put in to ensure that our near neighbour was able to have a smooth transition to democracy at a time when that wasn't necessarily an obvious outcome.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, in concluding, this is important reform. It is about respect for and recognition of our veterans, and all those on this side who have contributed have a very clear view of the importance of that and the importance of the bill.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="241710" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator DEAN SMITH</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Chief Government Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:32</span>):  I also want to speak this evening on this important piece of legislation, the Australian Veterans' Recognition (Putting Veterans and Their Families First) Bill 2019, and in doing so reflect on a number of important points. The first is that there's never too much that this country can do to honour the past service of men and women of the Australian Defence Force. This bill is an important part of what should always be regarded as an ongoing process of honouring the service and the sacrifice of veterans in our community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I paid very close attention to Senator Lambie's contribution, because Senator Lambie's contribution was important, for one reason. While I would have differed in the way that Senator Lambie communicated the issue, the reality is that, for some members of the veterans community, their experience with the Department of Veterans' Affairs has not always been smooth. They can at times feel that their concerns and particular circumstances are not being listened to, that they are not being understood and on occasion that they might even be being ignored. I think that's an important aspect to be constantly alert toâand I'll come to why that is important in a moment.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second comment I'd like to make is that this is an important bill, and I think that's demonstrated by the large number of senators who want to make a contribution to the debate on this bill, because it does honour veterans. It honours their families. It honours veterans, past and present. Of course, it also recognises that across our country the Returned and Services League plays a very important part in being a voice for the concerns of veterans and plays a very important part in giving life to the symbolism when we come to honour the sacrifice of veteransâvery, very important. While Senator Lambie's concern about this bill was in part, in her view, because it was heavily symbolic, I think that symbolism in this particular area of our community is still a very important part of what should be an ongoing process of constant recognition.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On this bill I speak with a bit of personal circumstance. My father served in Vietnam. He was a regular Army man who was asked by this country's government to go and stand up for certain values in Vietnam. He went to Vietnam and did his service. While he was in Vietnam he was engaged to my mother. When I think about the service of Vietnam veterans in particular, I also think about the difficulty that partners faced, indeed fiancees, as was the case in my mother and father's situationâand who had to live in a community like Australia in the very late sixties and early seventies and had to endure the remoteness of their loved ones serving in a country like Vietnam, at a time when parts of our country and parts of our community perhaps did not show much compassion for the service of regular Army men, as was the case with my father.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The situation in my family was further compounded when my father's younger brother was conscripted to serve in Vietnam. When I think about the contribution that veterans make in our community, I'm someone who does pay close attention and who has always had a keen interest in the history of the First and Second World Wars. But when I think about veterans issues I see them through the lens of my father's own experience. My father is now in his late 70s. His service in Vietnam is something we don't talk about in our household. I think that my brother and sister, my mother and I have learnt, not formally but informally, that there's still a lot of healing to be done on my father's part. I've never asked my father about the elements that are contained in this particular bill. I have never asked my father about his view on the Australian veterans' covenant, and I don't think that matters so much because I know at different points of time members of the veterans community come to deal with issues, take opportunities, as symbolic as they might be in this particular case, and, in their own time, they find an opportunity to use things like this, a pin, a veterans card, a commitment, an oath, as part of their own journey in better understanding the tremendous contribution and sacrifice they have made in pursuing what were objectives of the government and the Australian community at that particular point in time. So I'm someone who thinks that initiatives contained in this bill are not symbolic. They may not mean a lot to some people in our community, but to others they mean a great deal. I think it's worth remembering that 166,000 veterans are currently supported by the Department of Veterans' Affairs in our community, and 117,000 dependents of those veterans are supported by the Department of Veterans' Affairs.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Veterans, or the character of veterans, continue to change as the nature of our commitment internationally changes. The experience of veterans in the First World War and the Second World War was very different from the experience of veterans in the Korean conflict or the Vietnam War and, again, very different from the experiences of younger, modern veterans, let's call them, who have left service after making important contributions in helping to resolve the conflict in the Middle East.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a bill that is worthy of debate. I'm personally satisfied and pleased by the number of coalition senators that have put their names on the speaking list to contribute to honouring veterans and the organisations that support veterans, like the RSL in Albany, with which I know Senator Brockman has a very close association, and the Highgate RSL, of which I'm an associate member. Some of those members of the Highgate RSL were recognised in the Queen's Birthday honours list that was announced just recently. So this is an important opportunity to acknowledge that recognition of veterans' service is something that should be ongoing and constantly a top-of-mind issue for not just the coalition government but, I would hope, all future governments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In regard to this bill, there are a couple of specific comments I'd like to make. The first is around the Australian Defence Veterans' Covenantâsomething that I recall Senator McGrath having advanced and advocated a number of years ago, if I recall correctly. The Australian Defence Veterans' Covenant recognises and acknowledges the unique nature of military service and the contribution veterans and their families have made to our country. Legislating a covenant has been a priority for the veterans community for some years and is something the Morrison government is pleased to be able to deliver on after what has been considerable consultation within the Australian community. The covenant is supported by the Veterans' Recognition Program, which includes the veterans card, lapel pin and oath. These provide a way for Australians to identify a veteran and to acknowledge publicly or privately, depending on the circumstance, his or her service when they're not in uniform or wearing their medals.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm particularly pleased that this covenant initiative has been endorsed by employers, businesses, local community groups and the broader Australian public, who will be encouraged to support veterans and acknowledge their service through initiatives that encourage veterans and their families to connect with their community. Businesses and communities will also be encouraged to show their support for veterans by offering benefits or concessions for veterans card holders. Any benefits or concessions provided will be at the discretion of participating businesses and organisations, and I do think that's an important element of this initiative. Each business, organisation or community group will also receive information about how they can better support the covenant as the level of public awareness, endorsement and embracement of this initiative progresses in the community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm not too sure whether Senator Lambie mentioned this in her contribution, but I think the recent Productivity Commission report on veterans' issues with the Department of Veterans' Affairs is going to be a very important document which will enliven the debate about how we can better support the Australian veterans community. Already I've received a number of representations from veterans communities and veterans' representatives who are not convinced by the recommendations and the approach the Productivity Commission report has taken. I have given people a personal commitment that, as the son of a veteran, I will be paying very close attention to the concerns, the ideas and the points of view of veterans communities when it comes to framing a legislative response to the Productivity Commission report.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am someone who generally thinks that the work of the Productivity Commission is necessary and is to be applauded. The Productivity Commission process did give us an outcome on the GST issue, which I thought was very, very important in the Western Australian context, but it does not mean that the Productivity Commission is infallible. It does not mean that every proposition or every answer that the Productivity Commission provides is without contest. I'm someone, like I said, who has given communities a commitment that I'll be paying very, very close attention to that Productivity Commission report, the government's response and what we might find in legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I didn't have the opportunity this evening to listen to the first speech of the new member for Stirling, Mr Vince Connellyâ</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                    </a>  'An excellent speech,' says Senator Brockman. 'An excellent speech,' says Senator Reynolds. I have no reason to doubt that energy and commitment. He's a great member for Stirling. I have great confidence he's someone who will hold the seat of Stirling for a very long time. But the point I was about to makeâand perhaps I'm guessing nowâis that I'm sure Mr Connelly would have made a contribution in his first speech about the importance of veterans. I suspect he might have made some reflections on the Productivity Commission report and even expressed some of his own ideas about what might be a better way, an alternative way, to continue to support veterans and their families in our community.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is my final point before I sit down. Men and women have served this country and they have become part of the veterans community, but living with them and enjoying the celebration, the honouring that we do as a community with them, sometimes is equally matched with having to live with some of the suffering and sorrow and hidden hurt that veterans carry. That's a very, very important point to be acknowledged. Senator Lambie made that point in her contribution. I'm someone who believes that veterans deserve to be supported, but veterans' families deserve to be supported as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, with those brief remarks, I will leave it to other senators, other coalition senators, to make their contributions on what is a very necessary and very worthy piece of legislation.</span>

These amendments commit the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Commission to make decisions on veterans' claims within 90 days of receiving all the paperwork. They form a promise to treat veterans in a way that's fair, doesn't take too long, doesn't leave them worse off and doesn't treat them like the enemy.

If you have all the evidence on the table, there is no more to say about this. If you have all this evidence on the table and you can't make that decision in 90 days, I have to ask what sort of department you are running. This is part of the suicides. It's because of the time it is taking to do these claims. If you really want veterans to see that you have respect for them and for everything that they've done then, for goodness sake, 90 days is more than long enough to make a decision.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">South Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:51</span>):  I rise to inform the Senate that I intend to support Senator Lambie's amendment. I know how passionate and intent she is about, and how much she cares for, the welfare of veterans. The DVA of course sometimes doesn't meet the high expectations that Senator Lambie and others have for our returned service personnel. I must put on the recordâI know Senator Lambie doesn't agree with meâthat I struggle with the determination that someone who spends 24 hours in uniform is a veteran. Nonetheless, that is the protocol the government has installed. I think it's entirely reasonable that there be a legislative instrument that ensures or tries to ensure the DVA comply with a reasonable assessment and return when they're approached for assistance by those who have been prepared to give their all in service of our country. As such, I think this is a well-meaning amendment. It's worthy of consideration. I hope the government gives it due consideration. I look forward to the minister's response in that regard. Pending any further comments, it will depend on what the minister has to say.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Defence</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">20:53</span>):  I thank Senator Lambie for these amendments and I can advise that the government won't be opposing these amendments, but we do have grave concerns about the third amendment and the 90 days, and Senator Lambie's rejection of the clause that said 'except in exceptional circumstances', because there are circumstancesâvery complex casesâwhere these 90 days are not required. Of course, the government always wants as many of these as possible to be dealt with as expeditiously as possible.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What I would also say is that I was very privileged and very proud to have introduced this bill into this chamber on 4 July. I would like, on behalf of the government, to thank all senators who have contributed to this very important debate. The bill does create a framework in which the government, business and Australian community are able to more effectively and deliberately thank veterans for their service and acknowledge what they have done on behalf of all of us.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to thank five veterans in particular who are in this building this evening. They are five Long Tan veterans from the Vietnam War. I was deeply moved and privileged to have had the opportunity to thank each and every one of them. The first is Colonel Adrian Roberts MG OAM (Retd), who was troop commander of 3 Troop, 1 Armoured Personnel Carrier Squadron. Also joining us tonight was Lieutenant Peter Dinham, who was lieutenant and platoon commander of 2 Platoon, Alpha Company 6 RAR. I also want to thank Warrant Officer Class 1, Bob Buick, platoon commander of 11 Platoon, Delta Company 6 RAR; Flight Lieutenant Dr Bob Grandin, No. 9 Squadron RAAF; and also Private Victor Simon of 12 Platoon, Delta Company 6 RARâone of two Indigenous soldiers who fought in the Battle of Long Tan. Here in this chamber this evening I want to thank all of them for their service and all 108 Australian Anzacs who fought in the Battle of Long Tan. On behalf of all Australians, I say to those Vietnam veterans: thank you for your service.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the purpose of this bill: it provides for recognition of the sacrifice and challenges borne by both the serving member and also those closest to them, particularly the families who always make service to our nation possible. All Australians share a deep appreciation of the contribution made to our nation by our ADF, those who have defended Australia and those prepared to defend us all. The Australian people quite rightly expect that the welfare of veterans and their families should be an enduring priority for the government, and this bill highlights that priority.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With the introduction of this bill, the Australian Defence Veterans' Covenant is established. I think that is a very good thing and something that is well overdue. The Australian Defence Veterans' Covenant is a mechanism by which all Australians, from every corner of our nation, can honour a very proud military history. They can recognise the service and sacrifice of all who have committed to defend the nation and pledge their commitment to support veterans and also their families.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What some members of this chamber might not quite appreciate is that this covenant is designed to establish a new exchange of trust, of recognition and also of thanks between the Australian community and current and former serving personnel. The purpose of the covenant is to give a foundation to a cultural shift that we seek. That is a shift towards acknowledging our deep respect for those who serve, and their sacrifice so that the rest of us can enjoy the freedoms we enjoy today. The covenant bill is subtle but also sophisticated in the way that it encourages us all to build a new mindset around current and ex serving personnel. The bill provides all Australians with the opportunity to see serving personnel and veterans in a new light. It answers some questions that I get often: how can we recognise the service of these men and women, and how can we do that individually?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For too long, many veterans have unintentionally fallen victim to excessive paperwork and bureaucracy. Again, this bill seeks to introduce new values, a new framework and a new cultural change within those charged with administering the bureaucracy that supports our veterans. The bill calls on decision-makers to be just, to be fair and to be consistent. It encourages a culture of constant improvement and evolution in our decision-making around defence veterans and serving personnel, as well as promoting a more empathetic decision-making process. At its heart is a respect for all of our veterans. The covenant asks these decision-makers to evolve their decision-making and to be ever mindful of their own role in the emerging story of how our nation treats our veterans.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">By introducing the covenant, the government is encouraging a cultural shift in the way the community interacts with serving personnel. We encourage all Australians to step up, to step forward and to say thank you to the men and women who have given us so much and for those today who continue to give us so much. For all of those reasons, again, I thank those in this chamber who have contributed to this debate and I commend this bill to the Senate.</span>

As the recently appointed Greens' spokesperson in the area of peace, disarmament and veterans affairs, I look forward with enthusiasm to a productive working relationship with Senator Lambie as we continue to cause a bit of trouble in this place in the name of folks who actually need our help.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would finish this evening by calling the chamber's attention to the continued absence in the Australian legislative landscape of a responsibility upon this chamber and the other place to vote when we send folks to war. This has been a great conversation about symbolism. It has been a great conversation about the importance of paying homage to and caring for and respecting our veterans, all of which is true. But I would ask both parties in this place, Labor and Liberal, to take that language through to its natural conclusion and be prepared to sign your name on the dotted line when you send our troops to warâsomething which is not currently required of us in this place. If we're going to talk about our responsibility to veterans and if we're going to talk about the impacts of war, let's begin right here. Let's begin right here by passing a piece of legislation to bring us in line with the rest of the OECD and many of our so-called defence partners, such as the United States. Even the United States requires their congress to formally sign off on prolonged periods of deployment. Let us get our act together, in the names of those who have fallen and in the names of those who still fight, with the result of coming home, and let us at least be prepared to take responsibility when we put troops in harm's way.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator PRATT</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:03</span>):  I rise to speak on the Health Insurance Amendment (Bonded Medical Programs Reform) Bill 2019. I indicate to the chamber today that Labor is supporting this legislation. The bill amends the Health Insurance Act 1973 to legislate for a new Bonded Medical Program. This program was announced more than a year ago in the 2018-19 budget. Under the program, up to 850 medical students a year will be offered Commonwealth-supported places at Australian universities. This is in exchange for completing return-of-service obligations in currently underserviced areas.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The new Bonded Medical Program will open in January 2020 and gradually replace the two existing bonded programs. We on the Labor side note the government's assurances that, compared to the existing schemes, the new program is designed to streamline administrative arrangements, with one statutory scheme to replace individual contracts and deeds with each participant under the current program; standardise return-of-service obligations, with each participant to serve three years in an underserviced area within 18 years of completing their medical degree; standardise penalties for not completing return-of-service obligations, with sanctions including repayment of Commonwealth support and nonpayment of Medicare benefits for six years; and be more responsive to changing workforce requirements, with underserviced areas to be defined in new rules to be made under the act. This will allow governments to update eligible areas over time. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We note that the government is making separate but related reforms as to how underserviced areas are defined. The government has introduced a new Distribution Priority Area system, replacing the District of Workforce Shortage System for GPs. While Labor support the reasons for the change, it was implemented with little notice to GPs and patients in July 2020, and its impacts on particular areas are still, we think, to be understood. So we sought a briefing on this new system, including on whether it addresses workforce shortages in outer metropolitan areas as well as regional and remote and rural areas. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We welcome the fact that this bill includes transition provisions for participants in the existing programs. Some 10,000 participants are undertaking a medical degree training or return-of-service obligations under the current program and, with some exceptions, these participants will be able to opt into the new program from 1 January 2020. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We support this bill because it is intended to help address the shocking health inequalities in regional, remote, and rural Australia. As Labor's national platform recognises, Australians living in regional, rural and remote areas, typically, have poorer access to health services, poorer health outcomes and a lower life expectancy than those living in Australia's cities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare figures show that rates of health risk factors are higher in outer regional and remote Australia, with 22 per cent smoking daily, compared to 13 per cent in cities; 68 per cent being overweight or obese, compared to 61 per cent in cities; 72 per cent doing low or no exercise, compared to 74 per cent in cities; and 24 per cent drinking at risky lifetime levels, compared to 16 per cent in our cities. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Access to health care is also poorer, with lower rates of almost every health profession, including medical specialists, dentists and a range of allied health providers. I note that this also translates to the amount of Medicare rebate that's spent in Australia's rural and remote areas. As a result of these factors, the overall burden of disease is around 10 per cent higher in regional areas; 30 per cent higher in remote areas; and 70 per cent higher in very remote areas. Many of these deaths are preventable, with 2Â½ times as many potentially avoidable deaths in very remote areas than in Australia's cities. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So, while welcome, this bill is patently not a silver bullet for the issue of the health disparity between metropolitan, regional, rural and remote Australia. We call on the government to do much more on rural health in its third term than it's done in its first two terms. Labor stands ready to work with the government to improve the health of seven million Australians, or close to 30 per cent of all Australians, who live in rural, regional and remote Australia.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator ROBERTS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:09</span>):  As a servant to the people of Queensland and Australia, I rise to applaud and support the Health Insurance Amendment (Bonded Medical Programs Reform) Bill 2019. The health of bush and rural communities is important; their sense of community is so strong and appealing. I can recall being in Charleville just a couple of years ago. I had suffered an injury and was made to feel very welcome by all the staff in that small hospital. I noticed a nurse there who had lived all her life in Brisbane, in the big city, and she loved being out at Charleville. The Charleville ParadeâI was there for the 150th anniversary parade, with kids running around at night, free, unhindered and very, very safe. The townspeople, propertiesâvery friendly, get along well together. The same can be said of Longreach and Camooweal and many other towns in rural Queensland.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">After suitable consultation the government has tabled a bill that creates one single system for bonded education. That fixes a mess that Labor concocted. The provision of an increased number of placesâ850 annuallyâwith a three-year service obligation, to be completed within 18 years, is a very good outcome. The longer period allows specialists to train and upskill before going bush. In turn, rural and regional Queensland, and Australia, will benefit from medical professionals who have completed the long professional development that is so necessary for many specialties. Now, at first it seemed to us that three years wasn't adequate, but then we found out in our research that six years had been tried and failedâwith six years, people just didn't apply, and with one year, too many applied. So it looks like three years is a handy compromise. And 18 years seems a long time to fulfil one's bond, but, when one realises that it can be very arduous to fulfil a special training area, then we are happy with that 18 years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There were measures at first, then, that seemed to be impractical. Yet this bill covers the many varied circumstances across our diverse and large nation. We know that governments have tried, as I said, six-year service, and that deterred doctors, and one year caused a flood. Three years seems a handy compromise. One of our concerns is that medical colleges are aiming to maintain high fees for specialists, and that minimises enrolments. They choke down the number of specialists that can emergeâfor example, four to six dermatologists each year. That's why we have an 18-year bottleneck. It's needed to get specialists through. Yet for real support of regions we need more-ambitious changes to address these bottlenecks.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note that another initiative that One Nation supported, the National Rural Health Commissioner, has been successful in introducing 'rural generalist' as a career path. We look forward to the commissioner progressing next into nursing and midwifery. We like the practical changes. They're necessary. As I alluded to in my opening comments, the bushâthe rural areasâare inherently a great place for raising families. Ask the owner-managers of the Chinchilla McDonald's, who moved here from Western Australia and love it in Chinchilla. The people of many regional towns and centres echo the same.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With regional centres being such wonderful communities, people may wonder why the regions are declining. The answer is easy: their livelihood is being gutted; their productive capacity is being gutted. And what's doing that? Liberal and Labor federal and state governments are doing that. They're killing the productive capacity of our rural and regional areasâindeed, our nation. Economic mismanagement is taking many formsâfor example, electricity prices hindering the Charleville abattoir, which is a wonderful innovation in killing small animals, such as goat and sheep. In Mackay we notice people suffering high electricity prices. And it's not just families, not just individuals; it's businesses, it's clubs in North Queensland, paying huge amounts for electricity, and stores and restaurants that have freezers are really doing it tough, going out of business. Farmers in a severe drought are not planting fodder crops. That's insane.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've got tax policies that allow multinationals to not pay their fair share of the burden, while farmers, small business, employers, families and individuals pay enormous amounts of tax. Tax, in fact, is the most destructive system in this country. I recall reading figures around the start of this century that a person on an average income, around $80,000 per year now, typically pays 68 per cent of their income to government. That's taxes, rates, fees, levies, charges, special fees, and on and on. People thought that housing was the most expensive purchase in their lives; it's not. Government is our most expensive purchase. And are we getting value? No. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Look at water policies right now, with the productive capacity of our country being eroded and the Murray-Darling Basin Plan leading to charging exorbitant prices for water. Then we've got capricious federal government acts that hinder the rural sector. These are all driving people away from making a productive lifestyle in these areas. They're under pressure, under stress. Under the Labor and Liberal governments over the last couple of decades we've had the Murray-Darling Basin Plan, horrendous, really hurting the bush; the live cattle ban under Julia Gillard's government, hurting the bush not just in the north but throughout this country; and property rights stolen by the Howard government, of all peopleâthe Howard government. I already discussed that earlier today, but the Howard government is responsible through its first agreement with Rob Borbidge as National Party Premier of Queensland in 1996, following the UN Kyoto protocol; then Peter Beattie signing a deal with John Howard in 1998; then Bligh; then Palaszczuk-Trad; and also Bob Carr mirroring this in New South Wales. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Centralised bureaucratic control is another problem, with little accountability in this country. The federal government, as it gobbles up more and more and more of states' rights and states' duties and responsibilities, has no competition, and that means no accountability. We need to restore competitive federalism. Let me quote from <span style="font-style:italic;">Rebuilding t</span><span style="font-style:italic;">he Federation</span>, written by Richard Court, a former Liberal Premier of Western Australia, in 1994. He says: 'The driving of Commonwealth-state financial relations is the states' heavy reliance on Commonwealth funding to supplement their own source revenue. Currently, the states receive approximately 50 per cent of their total revenue from the Commonwealth.' That proportion has since increased. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In fact, I was at Balonne Shire Council in early 2017 and asked a simple question: 'What percentage of your annual revenue at the Balonne Shire Council comes from the federal government?' I was told it was 73 per cent, almost three-quarters of their revenue, and every cent comes with strings attached, with conditions. So who is really running the councils? It's the federal government. Who is running the states? It's the federal government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Murray-Darling Basin itself covers an area that is about 80 per cent of New South Wales. The government is allocating resources, controlling vital expenses in water and controlling property rightsâindeed, separating property rights from water rights, under the 2007 Howard government act. And then we look further. As Richard Court said, 'The Commonwealth is using the external affairs power to govern Australian citizens, often rushing to sign international covenants which trample on their existing rights.' They trample on our existing rights. He said: 'These international agreements are made primarily by people outside Australia. The terms and conditions are set by officials from other countries. While Australia takes part in the negotiations, it does not exercise a dominant influence. The foreign countries do.' 'The foreign agencies do', I would suggest, is more accurate. Richard Court goes on: 'We never see them, we never meet them and we cannot question them. Yet international covenants dictate to our Commonwealth government and the High Court and the state governments and the people what passes for governance and sovereignty in this country.' </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As Marty Bella, a Central Queensland councillor and cane growerâvery active now he's realised what is happeningâsaid, and he echoed what Senator Hanson has been saying for 23 years and what I have said since learning of it around eight years ago, there is 'an ideological assault on rural Australia'. This is the result of federal agreement with UN treaties, protocols and declarationsâagreements such as the 1975 Lima Declaration agreed to by Gough Whitlam, the Labor Prime Minister, and ratified the following year by his supposed archenemy, Malcolm Fraser, as Prime Minister. Then in 1992 we had the UN's Rio declaration for 21st century global governance, signed by Paul Keating's government. I will quote from this document I'm holding, the UN's <span style="font-style:italic;">Agenda 21</span>, in a minute. Then we had the 1996 UN Kyoto agreement, under which John Howard, as Liberal Prime Ministerâ</span>

I am talking particularly now about the core of that bill, which is trying to get doctors into rural areas. We know of some areas where doctors are being enticed by salaries of $500,000 and it's still difficult to find doctors. What I'm saying is that we need to do much more than just tidy up the errors that the Labor Party developed in the pastâimpractical errors. I'm going to the heart of the problem with rural communities right now: the abandonment of them by the federal government.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The 1996 UN Kyoto protocol, which I have discussed, led to the theft of property rights. If anyone wants to know the relevance of property rights, then look at any rural community in Queensland or in New South Wales. Then we had the 2015 UN Paris Agreement, under Prime Minister Abbott and Prime Minister Turnbull. That was just an agreement for every nation to do what they wanted to do. Australia legislated severe cuts while China said it would consider doing something in 30 yearsâmaybe. Meanwhile, we destroy our industries and economy and hand the jobs to the Chinese and others.</span>

I'm talking about rural communities that his party has neglected and, in Queensland, is neglecting right now. Shame on the Labor Party in Queensland! They use political correctness to shut down debate and silence people using labels such as 'racist', 'sexist' and 'misogynist', all in the name of victims, yet designed, ultimately, to control those same victims.. In this way, UN policy is taken as the basis of Greens policy. Labor piles on to get preferences, the Liberals pile on, and the Nats meekly kowtow.</span>

So much for today's so-called Liberals ignoring and opposing the classical liberalism of Ludwig von Mises, Friedrich Hayek and Frederic Bastiat, to name just three, when the government of their hero, Prime Minister John Howard, was the very government that stole farmers' property rights to implement socialist UN policies. Worseâand I'm coming to the endâthey did it in a way that deceitfully bypassed the Constitution to avoid paying farmers compensation. That's why we call for restoration or compensation on just termsârestoration, or compensation for the theft, of property rights. Going around the Constitution and using Labor premiers and a Liberal prime ministerâthese are the things that destroy the bush. These are the things that make it difficult to get doctors out into the bush. These are the things that make it difficult to get services adequately in the bush.</span>

The rule of law is going backwards as statutes replace common law. Constitutional succession is going backwards. Secure, free property rights are going backwards. Honest, efficient, fair taxation is going backwards. Honest money is going backwards. Strong families are being undermined by family law from Gough Whitlam's Labor government and from the UN's 'unsafe' schools.

While the bonded medical programs reform is heading in the right direction, the tide of destructive economic policies is swamping the bush and regional Australia. I'm proud to say we need to reverse that flow. If we really are serious about getting doctors, medical services and other services back into the bush to support the people who have the productivity of our country at heart, we need to reverse the flow of undermining of national sovereignty and governance. One Nation is pleased to support this bill and to work with the Liberal and Labor parties to restore our nation's productive capacity to make sure that people right around our country have adequate medical services.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="30484" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator BROCKMAN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Government Whip in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:30</span>):  I rise to make a contribution on this bill, the Health Insurance Amendment (Bonded Medical Programs Reform) Bill 2019, and to address the contribution from Senator Roberts briefly. Talking about disadvantage in the bush, you almost had me, Senator Roberts. I agree with you fully on that issue. But then you talked about a farming family moving from Western Australia to Queensland and loving it. Now, that's where it just went completely off the rails!</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Seriously, though, on this bill, there is a problem in rural and regional Western Australia, and all those who come from Western Australia are aware of the problem. All those who come from rural and regional Australia know there is an issue that needs to be addressed. I note there are three senators from Western Australia in the chamber at the moment on this side. All of them would know very, very well indeed some of the problems and challenges we face in rural and regional Western Australia, and I note the contribution of Senator Pratt as well in regard to some of the problems that we have in rural and regional Western Australia with attracting and retaining skilled medical professionalsâin particular, doctors but also nurses and allied health professionals.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This has a far-reaching effect. It obviously impacts on people requiring health care in their local communities, but it also impacts on those communities themselves. When the community loses or cannot attract a doctor or a nurse, or an allied health professional in the larger centres, that reduces the size of the community. It makes it less likely to be able to attract a doctor or nurse or medical professional in the future, as the community contracts over time, as communities have done across parts of rural and regional Australia. With the effectiveness of farmers in farming the land with fewer people and with the decline of some industries, the numbers of people in certain parts of rural and regional Australia have declined, the centres of those communities have been affected and their ability to attract and retain medical professionals and therefore access adequate medical services has declined over time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In Western Australia alone there are just over 300 medical vacancies, 115 of them being GP positions, in regional areas. I come from a regional part of Western Australia. In fact I was born in the Manjemup hospital in the deep south of Western Australiaâa hospital, incidentally, that Liza Harvey, the Leader of the Opposition in Western Australia, was also born in, and I'm sure a lot of the relatives of Senator O'Sullivan were probably born in that hospital as well. It's a fine, small, regional hospital.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">GPs in those country towns are absolutely vital. They're such a central part of a small town's life and existence. In the city it is easy to ignore or forget or not realise what a central component to life in the bush those GPs are. And as I've started to outline, there are towns across Western Australia where, unfortunately, attracting a GP is proving to be difficult, if not impossible.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Wongan Hills in Western Australia is a townâas Senator O'Sullivan and Senator Smith would knowânot very far from Perth. In fact, it's very much within driving distance: only 2Â½ hours away. Wongan Hills does not have a doctor to run their $1.5 million surgery. They've been trying to attract a GP since March of this year. Hopefully, that situation has been resolved in the last few days and what I have in front of me here is out of date. I sincerely hope that is the case; sadly, I suspect it's probably not, because these small regional communities have a very difficult time finding people who want to move to the bush. This is despite an extremely attractive financial package that includes a cash component, free use of a house and, of course, access to that very well equipped $1.5 million doctor's surgery. There are around 1,400 residents in that shire. The next closest medical centre is around an hour's drive away. This is not something that we have to deal with when we live in a major urban centre, even a major regional urban centre. But it is something that those who live inâI don't even think you could call this a remote communityâa regional community have to deal with, let alone those who live in even more remote circumstances.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are many other areas in Western Australia struggling to find medical professionals to meet their needs. In the north, in Derby, around half a million dollars a year is on offer to attract a GP. In Kalgoorlie, they cannot get enough medical professional servicesâand, incidentally, there's a great availability of jobs as a whole in Kalgoorlie at the moment, and a wonderful opportunity for younger Australians who want to enter what is a wonderful and dynamic community to take a step perhaps out of their comfort zone, and experience a part of Australia that many wouldn't even consider in that light, because of their lack of knowledge of what it means to live and work in a regional centre. Dalwallinu is another small country town that's seeking to attract a GP, is offering a very attractive financial package and cannot get someone.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Bonded Medical Program, as set out in this bill and in the changes that this government is introducing, is designed to try and address some of these very real problems that are faced by Australian communities in the regions. In short, the bill amends the Health Insurance Act 1973 to introduce a statutory scheme to streamline existing bonded medical placesâso this isn't reinventing the wheelâand the Medical Rural Bonded Scholarship schemes. It will require participants to complete a return-of-service program in return for a Commonwealth-supported place to study medicine. The proposed amendment promotes access to and equity in health services in rural, regional and remote Australia, where there are currently less-than-adequate services. It is, in fact, part of a much larger, $500 million Stronger Rural Health Strategy announced by this government. The bill has the support of key stakeholders, such as the AMA and the Australian Medical Students' Association. This is about streamlining and modernising an existing framework, and it brings existing schemes together under a single framework to move towards a single bonded medical scheme in future years. It replaces the need for individual contracts or agreements with each participant in a bonded medical program. It reduces the administrative burden by reducing and standardising the number of conditions and sanctions. It better targets the bonded medical workforce by changing workforce distribution requirements. It will also introduce and mandate the use of a web portal to improve the administrative management of the program.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It also introduces the ability for participants to seek review of certain decisions by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. Obviously, where people take these roles on, and perhaps they don't fully understand what they may be getting in for. I hope they do. From my discussions with a number of medical professionals who have been through these kinds of programs, they certainly find it a very valuable and rewarding experience. But we understand that things can sometimes not go 100 per cent according to plan, and therefore a review of certain decisions by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal is an important part of these changes.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I have stated, these changes are to schemes that have been in place for some time. The Medical Rural Bonded Scholarship Scheme commenced in 2001. It provided 100 Commonwealth-supported places each year in a medical course at an Australian university, with an attached scholarship. It began its iteration as a six-year contract requiring participants to work in rural or remote areas once their fellowship was achieved. This has been closed to new entrants, but the 100 places will be added to the bonded medical places from 2016. Bonded medical places commenced in 2004. This provides a Commonwealth-supported place in a medical course in exchange for an agreement to work in an underserviced area for a length of time equivalent to the length of the medical degree. For those who joined between 2016 and 2019, the return of service is only 12 months. It is currently delivered through a complex series of contractsâmy understanding is that there are around 20 contracts and deeds of agreementâwhich makes the system complex and makes the system outdated.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the program has changed over time, significant differences in contractual arrangements have been developed within and across various streams. This affects the majority of participants who commence their return-of-service obligation. The new statutory scheme modernises and consolidates the program to ensure it is responsive to current and future workforce needs, as well as offering a modern and flexible arrangement to support the future rural medical workforce. It will not affect existing participants unless they choose for it to, so it's a voluntary, opt-in system. Participants will be required to work as medical practitioners in eligible locations for a total of three years, which must be completed within 18 years from when the participant completes their course of study.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will note here that I think one of the key things they have been shown over the yearsâas various governments have quite genuinely tried to address this problem, with mixed successâis that what has proved to be successful is either training people who originated in the bush and then getting them to return to the bush or perhaps giving people who have never spent time in the bush a taste of bush life who then find they do actually like it. That's why those three years are very important. It's important for people who commit to this program to be able to get out there into the regions and spend some time in the bush. A lot of them will fall in love with rural and regional Australia, as many of us in this place have as well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On withdrawal costs from the scheme, if a withdrawal occurs after the second year of study or they do not complete a return of service within 18 yearsâif either of those conditions are metâthen the participant must pay the Commonwealth costs of the person's cost of study, less the pro rata proportion of service completed, as well as the interest or cost of scholarship. Obviously, there will be those who, for whatever reason, choose not to or cannot fulfil their obligations. Medical benefits will not be payable for six years from the day a breach occurs if return of service is not completed within 18 years. There is also the potential for an administrative penalty to be imposed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I will wrap up. A second reading amendment has been circulated. Those opposite, who have abandoned the bush for a very long time, should think very carefully about criticising this government for its level of support for those in rural and regional drought-affected communities. This government, over a period of time, has been extraordinarily responsive to the needs of those in the bush, including through the farm household allowance, which this second reading amendment mentions. We have ensured its ongoing availability for those in drought affected areas, ensured that the length of time people are able to stay on it was increased where appropriate and ensured that those drought affected communities and drought affected shires had some direct financial assistance, assistance for fodder and the like. This government has been extraordinarily focused on and responsive to the needs of drought affected communities across Australia. I think it is slightly churlish of those opposite to propose this second reading amendment to this billâa bill unrelated to drought relief; a bill about getting more doctors into the bush.</span>

Before I go to substantive matters, I want to reflect on some comments that Senator Roberts made. Senator Roberts shared with the Senate chamber a scorecard for human progress when it comes to respecting and upholding civil liberties. I'm not too sure I agree with Senator Roberts. On a number of scores he talked about things going backwards. There was an important score that he failed to mention, and it goes to the heart of this bill and to the heart of regional representation in this chamber. It goes to the backwards performance of the Australian Labor Party in Queensland. I make this contribution knowing full well that Senator Watt is in the chamber tonight. </span>

                    </a>  Madam Acting Deputy President, I have a point of order on hubris. I'm not sure that it serves Senator Dean Smith very well to be demonstrating this level of arrogance. I ask him to reconsider.</span>

                    </a>  On this side of the chamber we call it humility. It is important to make this point because it goes to the heart of this issueâregional representation and the extent to which people who come to the Senate representing regional areas either mock the contributions of people like Senator Roberts or fail to make solid contributions of their own.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have two other points on the performance of the Australian Labor Party in Queensland. We all know that Queensland is one of the most regionally diverse states in AustraliaâI think probably second only to Tasmania. So the issues that we're talking about in this particular bill, which is about addressing workforce shortages in rural communities, are very important. When people listen to the contribution of Labor senators tonight and tomorrow they should bear these electoral statistics in mind. I have two final statistics before I go to the heart of what we're talking about here. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The first point is that the ALP received their lowest primary vote in 85 years, recording only 33.3 per cent, in 2019. Their worst result was in 1934, with 26.8 per cent. Finally, the ALP preference flow in Senator Watt's home state of Queensland fell from 57.9 per cent in 2016 to just 50.2 per cent in 2019. The coalition gained the seats of Longman, with a swing of plus four per cent, and Herbert, with a swing of plus eight per cent, leaving the ALP with only six out of the 30 seats in Queensland. That's a very important point when you think about those 30 seats in Queensland and the number of seats that are predominantly regional seats.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator CANAVAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Queensland</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Resources and Northern Australia and Deputy Leader of The Nationals in the Senate</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:50</span>):  I rise tonight to express my condolences on the passing of Paul Neville, a former member for Hinkler. Paul passed away in the early hours of New Year's Day earlier this year. We've not had too many sittings this year and I've been waiting for some time to pay my tribute to him in this place. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Paul was a true gentleman, a friend and someone you just enjoyed being around. He was the kind of person that makes this crazy place in Canberra bearable. We miss him greatly in the Nationals party room. Our Christmas parties have not been quite the same without Paul. We in the National Party have always had a tradition of making our Christmas parties fancy dress, but it was Paul who took things to another level. There was a famous photo of Paul dressed at one of these parties in full lederhosen costume, knee-high socks and all. He's probably about 70 in the photo but he has the grin of a seven-year-old. Paul made everything seem more fun. Paul once told me a great story of the first time he missed a vote. He had ducked out of the parliament to arrange that year's fancy-dress costume. He got a call from the whip asking where he was. When he replied, 'Fyshwick,' I am not sure the whip was very amused. When he followed up that he was choosing a fancy-dress costume in Fyshwick, things probably went from bad to worse. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Paul could always get a laugh, and he enjoyed making others happy. He was a glue for our party and could take the tension out of any situation. But Paul was not a clown. He was a wit. He was one of the most switched on parliamentarians I have known. He could quote poetry and Shakespeare at the drop of a hat. That was probably because he was a frustrated thespian. He loved the arts. Paul's first career was in the arts. He was the first full-time CEO of the Arts Council of Australia in Brisbane. He later worked in a cinema and was a partner in a drive-in movie theatre. I think those skills served him well in this place, where telling a story is part of the role. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Before Paul served as a member he worked in regional development for the Bundaberg region. His understanding and passion for this work is what helped Paul win close election after close election. He ended up serving as the member for Hinkler for 21 years. In fact, Paul first ran for political office in 1969, losing the seat of Wide Bay. He would wait another 23 years to run again, and we in the National Party are very glad that he persisted.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Paul made enormous contributions to highlighting the infrastructure needs of regional Australia, especially communications. He was the go-to guy in our party room for all matters relating to communications and broadcasting. He was a tireless advocate for the Inland Rail project. In his last speech he mentioned that his children had promised him a trip on the inland rail for his 110th birthday present. It's sad that Paul won't be able to make that trip, but he did live to see the coalition government commit to building the inland rail, and we certainly plan to have it done long before 2050. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Notwithstanding our investment in infrastructure, there has, unfortunately, not been progress on regional broadcasting, another of Paul's passions. In his last speech he warned of the dangers of removing the two-out-of-three rule, which restricts media from owning too many different broadcasting outlets in one region. Unfortunately, some of Paul's concerns have been vindicated through the continual removal of regional broadcasting services or their syndication from a faraway centre. Paul had incredibly loyal staff, many of whom still work in this place. One of his staff, Kate Barwick, works for me. Paul's influence in this place remains, and he will continue to be a role model for what a good local member should be. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Paul gave one of the greatest valedictory speeches I have ever heard in this place. He always had a lot of important things to say. Even though, in this place, time constraints are relaxed for valedictories, there is some notion that you can't speak forever when there are speakers to come after you. His valedictory, however, in Bundaberg had no such constraints. His resulting 77-minute speech will not be one I will forget in a hurry. I can distinctly remember Paul, at about the 40-minute mark, mentioning, 'I will finish on this point.' That point went on for another half an hour. The next time I saw Paul was at the ordination of the Bishop of Rockhampton, Michael McCarthy. As we left the church after a three-hour service, I turned to Paul and said, 'Mate, that was nearly as long as your last speech!'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Paul was a man of great faith and resolve. He exhibited the true ideals of the Catholic faith. He cared for those less fortunate than him, he was humble and, of course, he had a large family, with five kids. In one of my last conversations with Paul he asked me, 'How many kids do you have now?' When I replied, 'Five,' he, as quick as a fox, replied with, 'Well, you're either a committed Catholic or lapsed Protestant!'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Paul's true love was his family. His wife, Margaret, was as much a part of his success as were his own efforts. They were a true political team. Margaret was as well known around the electorate as Paul and, given how many close elections Paul survived, I think it is true to say that, without Margaret, he would not have survived. But Paul didn't serve to win elections; he served to help people. We miss him greatly in the Nationals party room. He remains a template for us all to imperfectly strive for. I know that his wife, Margaret, and his family miss him, too. There is some solace, however, in remembering how many lives he enriched and how many lives his example continues to shape. Vale Paul Neville.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New South Wales</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">21:55</span>):  From across the chamber, I acknowledge the passing of Mr Paul Neville, a person who was determined to serve this nation. It's a great honour to serve this nation and it is a great commitment from your family to enable you to do it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The work that we do here does matter. This evening I want to raise concerns about the nature of the work of the current government, the new Morrison government. Another day has gone past and another occasion upon which this government has failed to adequately respond to a critical issue for Australia right now, and that is the public safety concerns around housing. There's no agenda on the horizon, from what we can see, about the responsibility to protect people in what they comfortably know, for the most part, as their own home. We saw the failure of this government immediately in this month's Building Ministers Forum, where it failed to address legacy issues in the building industry and, instead, offered only a modicum of regulation on new buildings, offering no relief to the plethora of current buildings that are in strife.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last Christmas, and I say this as a senator from the great state of New South Wales, the country watched in horror as residents of Sydney's Opal Tower were evacuated as cracks crept up the walls of their homes and threatened to destroy the building itself. Now, only a few months later, we have seen another Sydney tower block, in Mascot, evacuated due to similar shoddy building practices. This epidemic of dodgy development isn't confined to Sydney alone, but I do know from my conversations with the new leader of Labor in New South Wales, Jodi McKay, the member for Strathfield, that she is very concerned about the failure of the Liberal government in that state to own up to not paying attention while these buildings were under construction and currently failing to deal with the reality that people are at risk in their homes. But it's not just in Sydney, and that's why it matters what happens here in Canberra as well. In Melbourne, flames engulfed the cladding of the 43-storey Neo200 building in February, and last year incomplete grouting in Central Melbourne's Collins Arch project caused the pre-cast concrete columns to crumble.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a crisis on our building sites across the nation. Every Australian should feel safe in their own home. A home is somewhere to relax after a tough day at work. It's somewhere to raise your family, to build memories, to be a sanctuary against the slings and arrows of the outside world. No Australian home should make their owner fear for their safety; nor should any Australian be forced to live for weeks out of a hotel room, fearing that their home is going to collapse. The Morrison government has, instead, ruled out any federal funding to remove cladding, despite the horrors of the Grenfell Tower disaster in the UK and this year's Neo200 fire in Melbourne.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Only last week, in my beloved home place of Robertson on the Central Coast, the Erina ice rink was forced to close for at least a year due to the concerns over dangerous and possibly flammable cladding. The disaster of that in terms of a public health risk is one thing, but behind the inability to access that service is some young person's dream of success or some family's practice of providing an opportunity for their son or daughter to grow their skills. They won't be able to access that building because the supervision of it has been so grossly inadequate that its safety is now an issue and it's too dangerous for people to actually use the building for the purpose for which it was designed. That is a failure that should not be happening in Australia in the 21st century. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In New South Wales the Berejiklian government has also failed to adequately respond to any of the crises in the building industry in Sydney, despite the clear case for action, and, unlike the government in Victoria, the Berejiklian government hasn't announced any money to replace dangerous and flammable cladding. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The 2018 Shergold-Weir report identified many problems with state enforcement of building codes, saying that intervention by state governments is rare and that enforcement is lax, with very few providers having their licences revoked. And, in some cases, we've been hearing that licensing simply doesn't exist. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The construction industry amounted to about eight per cent of Australia's GDP last year. It's the biggest non-service sector of our economy, employing about 1.1 million Australians, and people who work in this industry are rightly proud of the great work they doâthe buildings that they build for Australians to live and work in safely, to recreate in. They go with the best intent, delivering what is enabled and allowed by the laws and regulations of this time. It's the regulations that are failing, not good, hardworking Australians. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an important sector in our economy. It cannot be allowed to have the confidence in it undermined or to maintain outdated and dangerous practices. This has caused such a crisis that many insurers now have refused to renew indemnity policies for many building certifiers or they've flagged an increase in premiums due to a flood of claims. So, for some certifiers, premiums have jumped by over 300 per cent in this last year alone. That is drastically increasing the cost of doing business. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor understands that reform must be led by this federal government and that it must be uniform across the nation. A house is a house is a house no matter what state or territory you live in. Conditions of safety are required for every family and every workplace. That's why Labor supports commonsense reform, such as introducing direct identification numbers to help catch dodgy phoenixing directors, to improve compliance with the National Construction Code and to toughen up penalties for noncompliance. These are essential changes that the federal government could take right away to ensure that bad apples in the industry are punished and that key points of the broken regulatory framework are fixed. But have we seen any action from this government in responding to the crisis that people are facing across this nation, with the homes around them so unstable that they're forced to move out with their children and live in temporary motel-like accommodation, with sometimes $700,000 or $800,000 worth of mortgage still hanging over their heads and the cost of remediation being targeted at them?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This disaster is on the watch of two Liberal governments, at state and federal levels. This crisis needs a revolution in both the culture and the practices in the building industry which have for too long, clearly, rewarded greed and speed at the cost of the very inhabitants of the buildings that were being constructed. The government needs to show leadership and to send a clear message to those who would endanger lives by cutting corners, cutting costs. We do not have a Third-World set of practices here in building. We will not stand for this malfeasance any longer. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When this government and the New South Wales government defend the indefensible, remember this reality of homes literally falling apart has happened because there were safety provisions that they allowed to slip away in the name of reducing red tape. They sold off community safety to the highest bidder, to the loudest voices and to the most unscrupulous, and the price of their red-tape reduction is far too high. Ask the families who once lived in Sydney's Opal Tower. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reforms that we need cannot be piecemeal. Shameful practices cannot be allowed to flourish in any state or territory; instead, they must be stamped out nationwide. The Morrison government cannot continue to abrogate its responsibility to safeguard the lives and wellbeing and property of Australians. Scott Morrison and Minister Andrews can no longer ignore the actions of dodgy operators and cowboys in the building industry. On behalf of the people of New South Wales, whose requests are falling on deaf ears in the Berejiklian government, and also of the people here in Canberra, I call once again, urgently, on Minister Andrews and Prime Minister Scott Morrison to enact a coherent package of reforms, one modelled on those recommended by the Shergold-Weir report, and ensure that Australians buying their homes in good faith will not have their property and their dreams crumble around them. We cannot let another disaster like the Opal Tower, or even worse, like the Grenfell Tower, occur in an Australian city. The time to act is now. The Prime Minister should move on this issue.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="e5z" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Senator SIEWERT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Western Australia</span>â<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Australian Greens Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">22:05</span>):  I rise tonight to share further accounts of people's lived experience of Newstart. I promised I would continue to share these accounts in the chamber. This week, I share older Australians' experiences of struggling to survive on Newstart. There are now more unemployed workers aged between 55 and 64 receiving Newstart than any other cohort. In December last year, there were 173,196 people between the ages of 55 and 64 struggling on Newstart. Older Australians are more likely to experience long-term unemployment: around 25 per cent of people aged between 55 and 64 have been unemployed for two years or more, compared to only 13 per cent of people aged between 25 and 34. We know that the longer people are out of work, the lower their chances of gaining employment. It becomes more and more difficult.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government talks about helping unemployed workers into jobs, but is it really helping these groups who are most at risk of long-term unemployment? Last year, a Senate inquiry into jobactive found mature-age unemployed workers aren't being supported by their jobactive providers to find employment, and that jobactive services and mutual obligations are currently not tailored to mature-age workers. The inquiry heard evidence that jobactive doesn't recognise the age discrimination experienced by mature-age workers, and that jobactive staff don't have enough tools or resources to manage their older unemployed workers. This situation is made even worse by the additional barriers older people face when engaging in the workforce. Some of these barriers include age discrimination, health issues, disability, skills and education. In 2018, the Australian Human Resources Institute, in partnership with the Australian Human Rights Commission, undertook a survey of older workers. The survey found that up to 30 per cent of Australian employers are still reluctant to hire workers over a certain age, and that, for more than two-thirds of this group, that age was over 50. Before receiving Newstart, everyone is subject to an income and liquid assets test, having to use up most of their savings before being able to access Newstart. Older workers are therefore put in a terrible situation where they have to use up most of their savings and then try to survive on Newstart. And, even if they find work, after being out of work for some timeâas I've just said, for a lot of them, it's after more than two years without workâthey then face an uphill battle to find financial security before their retirement. Or they have to keep on working.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll now share some of those experiences of older workers on Newstart. One person simply said: 'I'm 59 years old, on Newstart, living in a tent with my two dogs, because I can't afford to live anywhere else.' Another said: 'My husband is nearly 64. I am 61. We are both on Newstart, renting. Life is tough, going through our savings. We deserve better.' One person described how visiting their GP was a luxury while living on Newstart: 'Thank you for sticking up for Newstart recipients. Sadly, I'm one of those. My husband passed away six years ago this Christmas. As an older Australian on a widow's allowance (which, by the way, is the same as Newstart) I have been discriminated by age and health issues preventing me from gaining any employment. Adding to the stress, I've returned a positive test from my bowel screen and I find out that, when I have my pre-admission appointment, I will be required to pay $137. I will get $62 back and will be out of pocket $75. It has also become a luxury to visit my GP. Like many other things on Newstart, everything is going up and I will use my food money for the pre-admission appointment. This becomes a common occurrence for many Newstart recipientsârob Peter to pay Paul.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I heard from many people about how the low level of Newstart is exacerbating mental and physical health issues. Somebody wrote: 'I am 61. I have been on Newstart for three years, since I got sick. I will never get well again. My Centrelink medical exemption ended a couple of months ago. They say I can work two days a week. I literally can't. I can't even clean my unit and have to pay privately for help at home. I've been trying to complete an application for DSP for nearly a year. I don't have help and can't get any help to do it. I'm just too sick to do it but somehow I am supposed to work two days a week. It's getting to the point where I will be cut off Centrelink by the job agency, for not looking for work.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Other people spoke about the significant stress they felt while having to survive on Newstart: 'The stress I've suffered being on this chronically low income for seven years, I believe, was responsible in significant part for my heart attack and stroke suffered at 62 years of age. The stress and worry can be so debilitating, and depression comes to the fore. For God's sake, an increase is desperately needed.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another person wrote: 'I was on the widow's pension for four years from the age of 61 to 65, which was the same as Newstartâless than $300 a week. I held down a full-time corporate job for 22 years but had a mini-breakdown. Luckily, I was in subsidised housing; otherwise, it would have been desperation in the extreme. Older people get so much discrimination. I did supplement this with going back to uni at 50. Even at Centrelink, I heard one of the younger staff say, "Not another one to support." Just so hurtful! They forget that I've worked since I was 17 and paid more than my share of taxes. I just found the staff had picked up on the hostility of the government toward the unemployed.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also heard from older Australians who have repeatedly been rejected for the disability support pension: 'Nobody survives on Newstart. You just scrape by, payment to payment. I've applied for a DSP six times over the past five years and been knocked back each time without any explanation. I experienced PTSD from the Black Saturday bushfires. I had a stroke due to stress and burnout. I then had a total breakdown due to PTSD and was advised by my doctors and medical teams that my working life had finished. I was a mental health case manager for over 20 years and worked in Healesville. I moved to South Gippsland in 2012 at the age of 57 into forced medical retirement.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I then heard from another person who wanted to remain anonymous, so I'm just going to summarise instead of reading out what they wrote. They told me about how the husband had to give up work to look after his wife, who was chronically ill. He became her full-time carer. For a small while, they had some income protection, but that ran out, and then they had to go onto Newstart. They talk about how their Newstart payments don't help them cover the cost of the mortgage, how they may lose their home and how then they have no history of renting. They are very concerned about whether they will be able to afford to get a rental property. They are both over the age of 50. They wonder about their future.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Older unemployed workers across this country are doing it tough on Newstart. They juggle health issues and caring responsibilities. They're the classic generation who are still potentially looking after their older parents and younger grandchildren. They are discriminated against in the workplace, and this is ongoing. They are entering into retirement on the Newstart payment, having used up their savings. They are living in poverty. They are ageing into retirement in poverty. We know single women are one of the highest-growing cohort of homeless people because they can't find work, because they don't have superannuation. They may have had a split-up and don't own a home. People having to exist and survive on this low level of Newstart are then condemned. Older Australians living on Newstart are condemned to living in poverty for the rest of their lives. Newstart is too low. It needs to be increased by at least $75 a day. It should be a top priority for this government to increase Newstart by at least $75 a day.</span>
