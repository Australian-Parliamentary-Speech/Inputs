Currently the maintenance cost in a special hostel is about $16,800, whereas the present subsidy is $10,800. An additional subsidy to cover the present deficit and thereby prevent unnecessary admission to nursing homes is required. This would then represent a saving of $7,700 per person to the Government and ultimately, the tax-payer.

        This is a procedural motion only. Last week I tabled the report proposing that the name of the Joint Committee on the ACT be changed to the Joint Committee on the National Capital. The reason for the proposal is that the Committee, which has been a watchdog for the Federal Parliament on the detailed planning of the ACT, no longer has a lot of those responsibilities now the ACT has self-governmentâ€”the Committee's responsibilities relate only to the national capital functionsâ€”and, therefore, a change of name more accurately reflects the change in the Committee's role. It also might help clarify that role in the minds of the people  of the ACT. The proposal has the unanimous support of the Committee and also the support of the Minister for the Arts and Territories (Ms Fatin). I urge that the report be adopted.

         â€”in replyâ€”I rise to speak on the report tabled on behalf of the Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. I understand other members of the Committee will be participating in this debate a little later on. The Committee's task in undertaking this particular inquiry was to examine the corporate practices which predominated in Australia during the late 1980s and specifically to determine whether the existing legislative controls over the operation of Australian corporations adequately protected the rights of shareholders. Mostly, the Committee was concerned with the operation of listed companies, that is, those listed on the Australian Stock Exchange. In terms of shareholders, we were mostly concerned with small non-institutional shareholders. In conducting this inquiry, however, the Committee was keen to make sure that we were not simply looking for scapegoats, but rather that our examination would lead to a series of recommendations which would improve the standard of corporate behaviour in Australia while at the same time not putting undue burden on the operation of the Australian business community.

         While we were principally interested in the role of small non-institutional shareholders, it is, of course, interesting to note that Australia has not traditionally been a nation of shareholders. The proportion of Australians who hold shares in our listed companies is relatively small by international standards. Certainly, it is much less than that of the United States and of similar countries in Europe. I suppose the flip side of that is that institutional shareholders have always been major players in the Australian market and that trend is continuing. Indeed, as we move towards the next century, we could see that Australian shareholders would have their interests in the share markets looked at almost entirely by large institutions such as superannuation funds. It is unlikely that we will see large numbers of small Australian shareholders. This may change. There are, I suppose, some trends moving against that. One would be the move towards privatisation of government assets. Certainly, with the partial float of the Commonwealth Bank, there was a large number of small shareholders in that particular venture. However, if the experience of privatisation is any guide, it is quite possible that even over time the float of government assets will still lead to larger concentrations of shares in a smaller number of hands.

         Having said that, I note that the Committee was concerned to make sure that the market did operate effectively and that shareholders could hold interests with some sort of level of confidence. Even though big players, as such, may be able to look after themselves, it is still no consolation to small shareholders if they find themselves completely at the mercy of unscrupulous company directors, company officers, or at the hands of auditors and the accounting profession.

         Notwithstanding the experience of the 1980s, there have, of course, been some significant changes which again this Committee's report has to be considered in the light of. The most important of those has been the move towards a truly national system of company regulation through the Australian Securities Commission, this national system replacing the State system. I think that it was fairly held by the Committee to be the most significant reform that could be undertaken to improve the operation of the Australian business system. Coupled with that has been the significant increase in resources available to the Australian Securities Commission when compared with its predecessor. Those two factors alone, having a national system and having that national system adequately resourced, will probably do far more to improve corporate behaviour in Australia than any reconsideration of the operation of the legal system or any change in a raft of laws. Notwithstanding those changes, the Committee did examine the role of the major players, that is, the Australian Securities Commission, the Australian Stock Exchange and the other major contributors to a secure corporate system, the accounting profession, particularly auditors, and shareholders themselves, in the area of self-help; what remedies were there for shareholders to protect their own interests.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The Committee's major recommendation on this was that there should be a system whereby shareholders can effectively look after themselves. The major reform advanced by the Committee was the virtual abolition of the old rule in the case of Foss v. Harbottle. This rule effectively precludes individual shareholders from challenging decisions made by the directors, except in a specified number of exemptions. This rule, even though it has been watered down over the years by the interpretation of the courts, does prove to be an effective bar against shareholders challenging the actions of directors. When one combines that with the excessive cost of attempting to take actions, one can see that the position of smaller shareholders is indeed very stark.

         I suppose the most telling example brought to the Committee of the position of individual shareholders was the position of shareholders in the IRL group. I note that certain directors of that group of companies are now subject to charges before the courts. I will not canvass the particular issues involving those directors except to say that things only got to that stage due to the very determined effort of a group of shareholders, a couple of whom fortunately had the financial resources to pursue it. Those particular shareholders must have expended sums in the hundreds of thousands of dollars in order to pursue court remedies to try to bring into line the actions of the directors of that particular group of companies. Only if we can make shareholders' remedies more effective can shareholders have some confidence in the concept of self-help.

         The Committee's recommendation in this regard was the adoption of a system which has been trialled in Canada known as derivative actions. The basis of this is to allow the individual shareholder to take action against company officers and have recourse, once a prima facie case is established, to the resources of the company in order to pursue that action. That is a significant reform. It has been canvassed in Australia for some time. The Committee looked at the reform particularly carefully to make sure that it would not be able to be used by particular shareholders as a technique in a guerilla warfare against the officers of the company. Despite a few reservations on behalf of individual Committee members, the Committee as a whole resolved to adopt this new action.

         I believe that is a significant reform. I do urge the Government to give very serious consideration to the introduction of such a derivative action. It does overcome the rule in Foss v. Harbottle and I believe that, if it is adopted, it will mean a significant improvement for the right of individual shareholders.

         Finally, I would like to place on record my appreciation of the efforts of the members of the Subcommittee, in particular, who examined this reportâ€”the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello), the former Deputy Chairman of the Committee, the honourable member for Bass (Mr Smith), and the staff of the Committee secretariat, particularly Mr Donald Nairn, all of whom put a large amount of work into getting this report up and running. I believe it is a good report with solid recommendations. I know other honourable members will canvass other aspects of it, but I do believe it is worthy of serious consideration on behalf of the Attorney-General. I hope that we will see some amendments to the corporations law along the lines suggested in the Committee's report.

         â€”You are just jealous. Mr Speaker, I refer to aspects of this report which I think are worthy of wider understanding and comprehension. First, I think it is important that as legislators we do not overreact to the events of the 1980s. I am most concerned that in the professional fieldsâ€”not peculiarly those covered by this legislation but across the whole ambit, from medicine through law, accounting and indeed in every one of the professions in Australiaâ€”the highest possible standards, firstly, should be set. Secondly, we should not try to enforce in the 1990s a legislative inhibition which will deny the community the opportunity to retain the skills and disciplines of those who, over the years, have built the qualities of their respective professions and which, with respect to corporate law, will deny people the chance to participate as external directors, to act as auditors, or indeed to act as legal counsel or accountants. If we are not careful, the changes that are being sought by some could well mean that we are no longer able to maintain the incentive to perform that really is characteristic of our capitalist system.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         In that respect I have been very pleased to see the conclusions that have been reached in this report in three areas to which I want to advert. The first is with respect to auditors. It is obviously extraordinarily difficult to interpret exactly what the true and fair obligation of an auditor is in stating his view about matters before him. There have been some very sad company failures. Some, no doubt, have distinctly been the product of those who have been the entrepreneurs of yesteryear who have gone beyond the reasonable bounds of propriety and for whom there should be no public or legislative sympathy. But to enforce upon an auditor a requirement that he should always have second vision and be able to see behind the accounts as presented to him is not equitable, nor is it possible.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         For that reason the Committee, in reaching its conclusions with respect to auditorsâ€”and I refer those who have a particular interest to recommendations 16, 17, 18 and 19â€”tried to ensure that while there should be requirements to notify the Australian Securities Commission of malpractices that the audit has revealed, it has not tried to rewrite the laws. The Committee has suggested that the Australian Auditing Standards Board needs to be given similar recognition in corporations law to that of the Australian Accounting Standards Board. In that way there can be continued development of auditing standards and maintenance by the profession, under the general supervision of the Australian Securities Commission, of the extent to which there is a requirement to maintain a true and proper auditing standard to ensure that malpractices to the disadvantage of creditors or shareholders appear.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The second area that I think is particularly important in relation to the prime purport of this inquiry, and that is the rights of shareholders and their interface with directors, is a series of recommendations that pick up the business judgment rule, that define it, under recommendation 20. It looks a little further at the rights and responsibilities of directors in recommendations 21 and 22 and so on. And then, finally, the report looks at an interpretation in the final recommendation with respect to the criminal liability provisions of the corporations law.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         I think they are particularly important and I, like the Chairman of the Committee who has just spoken, would say to government, `I think the recommendations make sense but above all do not go too far. Do not try to write into corporate law responsibilities that, as I have suggested, are going to pass onto today's and tomorrow's generations, criminal liability because of those circumstances of the 1980s'. Indeed, one of my criticisms of the economic statement handed down by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) the other night is that I do not think he has really given the incentive to corporate investors to generate the jobs that are needed. And while it is not the jobs of directors that this House need particularly be concerned about, unless there is an opportunity for people to exercise responsibility as directors, the opportunity for employment in the rest of the corporate sector is no doubt lessened.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         So, what we have tried to do is to get a balance between the proper exercise of responsibility by directors, and their interpretation within the corporations law, and the rights of shareholders. I think that the recommendations here make sense. There is no doubt that, to the extent to which further recommendations relate to the Australian Stock Exchange listing, they also bear upon the responsibilities both of disclosure and of the way in which a director undertakes both his legislative and his corporate responsibility.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         In that respect I think it is particularly important that the extent to which the stock exchange rules develop should not always be necessarily matched by some type of legislative change. I am one who believes that the stock exchange does have a capacity to provide a listing requirement which ensures that there are disclosures of matters of particular significance to a company. There is a recommendation in the report which covers that, recommendation 14, so that there are obligations on the directors to comply with the listing rules.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Those listing rules are matters which, of course, can take more account of changing patterns and practices and community requirements. But, what I am saying is that in respect of the maintenance of a liability of disclosure, of liability of exercising due and proper care with the assets of a company and conducting affairs in a proper manner, I think this report goes a reasonable distance in trying to blend the enhanced recognition of the listing rules of stock exchanges while not going so far in the change of corporate law to prevent people from accepting what are significant and onerous responsibilities as external directors.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The third field is in the field to which the Chairman of the Committeeâ€”who has just resumed his seatâ€”referred, and that is the derivative action concept. Recommendation 27 specifically refers to that. It is very difficult to know to what degree, both in the field of derivative action and in the requirement for disclosure, there can be a proper balance set between the need to ensure that there is, on the shareholder's part, an opportunity to know what is happening to the assets of the company of which he is a shareholder and the requirement by the board of a company to maintain confidentiality to enable commercial in confidence decisions to be taken without risk; that by those other actions they are going to be revealed in such a way that it will prejudice the interests of the company.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         While there was significant debate within the Committee on the nature and character of these provisions, I think that the recommendations happily reach a fair compromise. Quite obviously there did need to be a consideration of the rule in Foss v. Harbottle and of a way by which there can be some legislative variation to that. What the Committee has recommended in its amendments to the corporations law is that there should be a change to provide standing to particular persons set out in recommendation 26, namely:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        . any member or former member, of the corporation or a related corporation; . any director or officer, or former director or officer, of the corporation or a related corporation;
       </para>
       <para>
        It then allows through a further recommendation that there be a capacity for people who have particular standing to seek leave to proceed on behalf of the company and to pursue a derivative action.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         I think that really does help to improve the situation of shareholders who, in a number of circumstances known to many of us, seem to me to have been disadvantaged. So, we have tried to blend, in the recommendations of the Committee, the balance between the proper exercise of directors' responsibility and proper access for shareholders.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         So I believe that the Committee's report does make a significant advance in those three areas: the role and exercise of responsibilities by auditors; the role and exercise of responsibilities by directors and the access to the records of the company by shareholders.

         I recommend the report to the Government and trust that, in moving, it does not take the recommendations any further. If it does so, as I have suggested, we will be unduly imposing on today's directors a discipline and consequence of the affairs of the 1980s, which I do not think is in the best interests of the corporate sector, nor of the development of our economy in the parlous plight in which it now finds itself.

         It is the conventional wisdom in Australia, which has subsequently proven to be incorrect, that an audited balance sheet does accurately reflect the state of the company or organisation concerned and that the auditor will ensure that the documents which he presents and signs are an accurate set of documents in respect of the financial status of the organisation.

         In evidence before the Committee it was clearly stated that, in fact, in valuing assets, for instance, the auditors take account of the method of valuation prescribed by the directors of the organisation. In other words, it is available to the directors to have an audited balance sheet made out on the best case scenario in respect of the value of assets of an organisation.

         So we had the circumstance in 1986 of a balance sheet which was presented in respect of the Connell bankâ€”Rothwellsâ€”which reflected nothing of the financial situation of the bank, on which, however, a reasonable judgment could have been made by potential investors that the organisation was structurally financially sound and backed by adequate, and more than adequate, assets.

         In 1987 a similar report was prepared and it was only after challenges by the regulatory bodies, in particular Mr Bosch, that the auditors decided that they would not sign the balance sheet, even though apparently, dishonest as the balance sheet may have been, it met the legal requirements for an audited balance sheet. Mr Bosch actually told the Committee that he had sought to prosecute the auditors for their earlier balance sheet which was totally inaccurate, but that he was unable to do so because of the nature of the law and the requirements which are placed on auditors. There are changes taking place but I am not certain that those changes will, in fact, prevent the practices which I have mentioned from recurring.

         The auditors had found that balance sheet to be correct. But it appears that that balance sheet was based on the book value of the assets, not their actual value. This was at a time when property values had already started to decline. Some of the properties depended on boom in the property market in order to make a profit at the end and were overvalued for the purposes of the loans made against them. These were, to say the least, very risky ventures and the assessments of the valuations were also risky.

         A balance sheet subsequently prepared, by the same auditors, using market value for the same period, showed a change of something like $700m in the asset backing, on which that profit had been declared. It was some 30 per cent of the total asset. That was a variation in a balance sheet.

         What is any ordinary citizen to think who reads something like this in a local paper, `The corporation's success has come at a time when other financial institutions are entering tough times' and who discovers that the organisation at that time was in fact insolvent when its balance sheet said it was in profit? That balance sheet was legally and correctly audited in accordance with the instructions which existed at the time. What hope does the ordinary citizen have in those circumstances? For 12 months, a public relations firm was able to convince newspaper editorsâ€”not only the local onesâ€”and others, that rumours, not bad management, had caused the downfall.

         The truth may be known at some time in the future when the Victorian Supreme Court decides to get itself out of the road and allow an inquiry, which has been held up by it for some time, to actually report. There is, of course, the problem that, if there happens to be a change of government in Victoria, the report will probably be buried in government pigeonholes because the Liberal Party has close connections with the organisations involved in this exercise.

         There is one other thing that I think is important that we understand about the responsibility of auditors. If, in fact, there are attached to the audit report, qualificationsâ€”and there usually areâ€”which indicate that the auditors do not feel that the audit has been properly conducted, or that the audit does not necessarily reflect the current situation of the company, it should be an obligation for the balance sheet of the company to carry that qualification clearly and precisely. That is not always done; certainly, it is information that a potential investor is entitled to have.

         One other matter which concerns meâ€”and this also forms part of the audited balance sheet of this particular organisationâ€”is that, in announcing the annual report, the chairman was able to indicate that the liquidity ratio was 17.2 per cent. It is now known that that liquidity ratio included what were called non-redeemable shares, a device which was thought up probably somewhere else but, nevertheless, was used to inject what was said to be equity into the organisation without the principals having to advance funds.

         In the Victorian Supreme Court in recent weeks, Mr Justice Vincent has indicated that that equity was raised in some cases by false pretences. I do not know whether charges will be laid because the report of the inquiry has not come down. But it is clear that many thousands of people were misled into believing that, in buying shares in this particular organisation, they were in fact investing in another form of deposit investment, not in a liability share where they had no guarantee whatsoever of a refund of their moneys.

         Quite honestly, I cannot understand why many of those shareholders have not sued the principals of the organisation, including the directors, who have some responsibility if their shares were sold under false pretences. That is the import of what Mr Justice Vincent found. No-one is clean in this area, but we are inquiring into the nature of the law and the right of shareholders to know what is going on in an organisation and the manner in which stock exchanges are able to conduct their business, so that shareholders are able to make a judgment on their own as to the value of what they might purchase or the competing interests of those who are selling. Under the present law that judgment cannot be made. The audit standards are one area where the law has to come up to date in order to ensure that information that bears an auditor's signature has the status and standing that I believe most members of the community believe it has and that I certainly believe it should have.

         â€”by leaveâ€”This is a very important report and I am going to quote comments made by the Chairman of the Committee, the honourable member for Fisher (Mr Lavarch), especially, and comments made by some of my colleagues. Whilst I appreciate the comments of the honourable member for Corio (Mr Scholes) about a certain building society in Victoria, I think it is unfortunate that he perhaps lowered the debate somewhat by crystal balling what the Liberal Party may or may not do. If the honourable member of Corio were really fair dinkum about all this, he would have put in everything, rather than pulling out a parcel of what may or may not happen in relation to the Pyramid Building Society.

         I would have thought that, if there were to be fairness about this and overall responsibility, he would have even mentioned the comments of the former Treasurer of Victoria, Mr Jolly, in February of the year of the collapse, when he said that the organisation was rock solid and there was no need for anyone to have any concerns about the financial viability of it. If we are going to allocate responsibility for community perceptions in relation to this matter, I think the Victorian Labor Government has equal responsibility with many others involved, both within and outside the organisation.

        The Committee's approach has not been to seek scapegoats for the failures in corporate behaviour and regulations, rather to identify deficiencies in the regulatory landscape and to suggest mechanisms to empower market participants, particularly investors, in enforcing their rights and responsibilities.

        I congratulate the Chairman on that comment because I think it takes a sensible approach to what is indeed a matter that caused us all great concern during the 1980s. My colleague the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair) made the comment that it is appropriate not to overreact to these sorts of things. My concern is that, if we go down the path of rigidity, there is some risk that we can actually direct endeavours into antisocial practices, as opposed to perhaps achieving what we wanted to achieve, and that is to avoid them. Although I am a believer in some regulation, I believe that rigidity of regulation can sometimes achieve what it actually did not want to achieve and it can take an opposite purpose.

         The other thing we need to do is look at what the driving force is that pushes those people into antisocial and anti-commercial practices. Of course, this report could never have addressed that but I think that it is an interesting question that we need to address further down the line. Is it a matter of greed; is it a matter of overt enthusiasm for the particular institution that a company officer might be working for; or is it a perception that the Government is not assisting that particular business or business in general? I would like to sit down with someone who has been involved in this antisocial behaviour to find out what their motives were for it. I can see the smile on the honourable member for Fisher's face. Perhaps he would be interested to join me in those discussions to try to get away from the legislative and legal parts and find out exactly what the reasons were.

         The difficulty, of course, in any question on regulation is that there is a fine line between interfering with the rights of company officers to properly run the business and the rights of shareholders. I think that this report seeks to put a far greater onusâ€”an onus that I certainly supportâ€”on those who have an intimate knowledge of the running of the company. I think that it is fair to say that the 99 per cent of Australian shareholders who are normally small investors would know very little about the particular company in which they have a shareholding. There would be very few who would go to annual general meetings of those organisations. They do not have an intimate knowledge. They rely very heavily on the good faith of the officers of that company. Therefore, when looking at the regulatory model that needs to be set up in relation to the proper conduct of Australian business, it has to be appreciated that that onus lies with those who have the more intimate knowledge. I think that recommendation 18 addresses the sorts of concerns that I have. It allows, in effect, third parties to regulate the way that Australian business is conducted.

         A number of my colleagues have expressed some concerns in a reservation, and I have my name on that, in relation to recommendation 26. I think that my colleague the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) encapsulated my concerns about that when he said:

       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        My concern was that, by empowering former shareholders and former directors to bring such actions, people who had no connection with the wrong that was being taken up in the company's name and who possibly had no interest in the outcome of the action would be bringing actions in the company's name.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I think it is important that, when it comes to allowing the derivative action, the court should assess who is the most appropriate person to bring the corporation's right of action. It may be that a former shareholder who was not there at the time the wrong was committed and has no interest in the outcome is not the right person to enforce the corporation's right of action. If provision is made for the court to take that into account, as I have said in the reservation, I have no difficulty; but I think to widen the class and not make any specific proposal as to how that can be taken into account is too bald and too wide on the basis of the evidence that came before the Committee. That is why we entered that reservation.

         In summary, I believe this is an important report not just for this Parliament but for corporations in this country, because it gives them direction and shows them that this Parliament does not necessarily want to wield a big stick, but the Parliament quite rightly expects that antisocial corporate behaviour should not continue. I think that we can go forward with these recommendations, which set a framework for a realistic and responsible approach. I hope the Government will take up the recommendations.

         â€”It is a great pity that this Bill was ever necessary. It is a great pity that the Government could not consult properly with interest groups, that the Government could not listen. What this Bill is all about is to repeal part of the Australian design rule No. 19.01 which deals with electrical connections on motorcycles. The aim of the Australian design rule which has come into force as of 1 March 1992 is to force all new motorcycles that are sold from 1 March onwards to have the headlight wired on so that, when the engine is started, the headlight will automatically come on. In this Bill we deal specifically with clause 19.6.106.9 of that Australian design rule No. 19.01. We are specifically moving that this be removed.

         I must say that in my time as a shadow Minister, I have never seen an issue so unite an interest group in total opposition. I have not had one single motorcyclist come to me and say that this is a good moveâ€”not one. I have, as I say, consulted widely; I have met with many, and all of them give the same answer, that compulsorily having lights on is not the way to go to improve road safety.

         The key point is that when you look for the research evidence, both in Australia and overseas, you find that what is lacking is conclusive evidence that having lights wired on is in fact going to add to road safety. It means, therefore, that the decision to have a light wired on is one that has been taken by the Government in haste, one that has been taken without properly researching the issue and one that has clearly been taken without properly consulting those most directly affected.

         I believe very strongly that the decision to turn on the light on a motorcycle during the day should be the responsibility of the individual rider. While the majority of cyclists do turn their lights on at least some of the time when they are riding, there are other times when experienced riders are quite adamant that having the light on can add to the risk and in fact is sometimes downright dangerous.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         There are a couple of other points that I do not believe the Government has thought through in changing the Australian design rule. One of them is the question of legal liability. It is still not clear whether or not this will add to the liability of the motorcyclist who may be involved in an accident with a motor car because it will be very difficult in most cases to prove whether or not the light was actually on. The globe might have blown five seconds before the accident, or the day before. It will be very hard to prove whether that was the case or whether in fact the globe was smashed in the accident. So the question of legal liability could become quite an interesting one and, of course, there are ramifications for insurance.

         The other point about changing the design rule is that it could add to a false sense of security, if people believe by having the light wired on it will somehow make them safer. Of course, in many cases, it could be the exact opposite. There are other concerns, which I will explore when there is a full debate. There is the question of the difficulty some motorists have in judging the speed and the distance apart of an oncoming vehicle with its headlights on. Again, this is where it could, in fact, add to danger rather than add to safety. Then, of course, we have the nonsense with agbikes having to have the light on.

         The history of the introduction of this Bill has been long and tortuous. I first introduced an almost identical Bill into the House on 4 May 1989. The Government did not allow it to come on for debate, so the coalition moved for debate as a matter of urgency in the Budget session of that year; but the Government refused to allow a second reading debate and gagged the motion.

During that debate there was unanimous support from coalition members for this Bill, and I was pleased to see there was considerable support from Government members also for the Bill.

On the times this Bill has been introduced previously, I have detailed how the need for it came about. Basically, there is no penalty in Australia for those who deface or dishonour our flag.

         The great majority of Australian people have had a gutful of unkempt demonstrators burning our flag in front of television cameras.

I believe such behaviour mocks our traditions and mocks our heritage simply for selfish gain and to get some cheap publicity for their causeâ€”which is usually totally unrelated to what they are doing to our flag.

There is nothing particularly draconian about these penalties in this Bill. They are par for the course for an offence of this nature, and they are similar to what is in legislation in other countries such as Norway, New Zealand, Japan and America.

         There are ample opportunities in this country for people to protest without offending the great majority of Australian people by burning Australian flags.

We have to draw the line somewhere. I stress that these people who protest are not actually protesting against the flag as such but against something else which is totally unrelated.

At the worst it would only be a breach of etiquette, protocol or convention. People who display flags on T-shirts and such are not exactly dishonouring the flag; they actually are very proud of it.

         â€”The Flags Amendment Bill has one aim and one aim only, that is, to entrench the current Australian flag so that the flag cannot be altered except by a referendum passed by a majority of electors throughout the Australian States and Territories.

         I want to say two principal things about this amendment Bill. Firstly, in trying to achieve its aim it is fundamentally flawed. Secondly, I wish to canvass the principal issue involved, which concerns whether Australia should at this stage be considering changing its flag and what mechanisms should be employed if that consideration is to go ahead.

         Where this particular Bill is flawed is that it attempts to impose a requirement of a referendum before the flag can be changed by adding a new section 9(1) to the Flags Act. This proposed new section requires that a referendum be held before the flag can be changed. However, the difficulty that the mover of this private member's Bill has is that, while that Act can be changed to put in a requirement that there be a referendum before the flag can be changed, he has not put in a requirement that that proposed new section, if incorporated into the principle Act, could not be removed by subsequent amendment.

         The aim of the exercise is to take out of the hands of this Parliament basically the change of the Australian flag and put it in the hands of the Australian people, but he does not take out of the hands of this Parliament the ability to merely remove that provision, if enacted, out of the Act. That might seem a moot point, but it is not. It came to light in Queensland in the mid-1970s when the then Premier, Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen, was somewhat concerned with the way in which the Whitlam Government was going at that stage.

         Honourable members might recall that the Whitlam Government started moving down the track of asserting Australian independence and cutting some of the remaining ties between Australia and Great Britain. I suppose the most notable of those actions was the removal of the right of appeal from the Australian High Court to the Privy Council. As well as removing that right of appeal, the Whitlam Government went down the track of installing an Australian honours system and attempting to remove the imperial honours system. Even though that did exist for a considerable time in some of the States, it was removed at a national level.

         Sir Joh was apparently alarmed that this may then extend to the Queen no longer being the Queen of Australia, even though it was, in fact, a Whitlam Government which installed the Queen as Queen of Australia. In response, however, Sir Joh succeeded in changing the Queensland Constitution to make the Queen the Queen of Queensland. As is the case with this particular Act, the Flags Act, the Queensland Constitution is merely an Act of the Queensland Parliament. That is, it is not like the Commonwealth Constitution which can be amended only by way of referendum. The Queensland Constitution is like any Act of parliament, and can be amended by a subsequent parliament.

         Sir Joh, realising this and being somewhat more suspicious of the motives of the Labor Party than those of the good honourable member who has introduced this particular Bill, attempted to doubly entrench the provision to make the Queen the Queen of Queensland. By that, he required not only that there be a referendum so that this provision of the Queen of Queensland could be changed, but that the provision installing that in the Constitution could itself be removed only by referendum.

         That raised a whole variety of interesting legal points, particularly around whether a parliament can bind a subsequent parliament in that way in an interpretation of section 11 of the Colonial Laws Validity Act. I will not get into the constitutional niceties of the argument except to say that it was broadly accepted in legal circles in Queensland after the Queensland Parliament passed provisions in that way. It was effectively entrenched that the status of the Queen of Queensland now can be removed only by way of referendum.

         The mover of this particular private member's Bill attempts to secure the same end, that is, to have the Australian flag changed only by way of referendum. But unfortunately for the mover, he has not placed his mind to the fact that the provision itself requiring the referendum can be removed by Act of parliament. Hence in a legal way it is really quite useless. Having said that, I think it would be quite wrong that if this amendment were passed by this Parliament a subsequent parliament should ignore the express wishes of this Act and attempt to circumvent its clear intention, by merely removing the provision, even though that course would be open.

I think we now are at the stage that we should be debating this issue, maybe up to the centenary of our nationhood. Maybe at that time it would be appropriate for there to be a referendum and the selection of a new flag, if that is what the majority of Australians want.

         The purpose of the Bill is to amend the Flags Act 1953 to ensure our Australian national flag cannot be altered except with the approval of the Australian people voting in a referendum. Anyone who argues that this Bill has been designed to prevent our flag being changed has missed the whole point of the exercise. There is nothing in this Bill that states or even implies that changes cannot or will not be made; only that they cannot be imposed without the consent of the Australian people.

         If a majority of Australians say, `Yes, we want the flag changed', then it will be changed. If the majority says no, then under the provisions of this Bill the flag will remain as it is. Surely this is what democracy is all about. Unfortunately, some members of the Government do not seem to agree with this simple and basic democratic proposition. If they did, they would be supporting the passage of this Bill. Instead, they argue that protection is not necessary because they do not have any plans to alter our flagâ€”at the moment.

         Their protestations and assurances are of little consequence and even less relevance, because the Bill does not only apply to this present Government but to all future governments, irrespective of their particular political persuasion. If and when this Bill is passed, and the proposed amendment becomes law, it will be just as binding on a Liberal-National Party government as on a Labor one, and that is exactly how it should be, because the flag we are talking about in this debateâ€”the Australian national flagâ€”is not the property of the government of the day, or of the Parliament. It is the people's flag and it belongs to all Australians, and the right and proper way to find out whether or not the Australian people want it changed is to ask them by way of a referendum.

         â€”I had not planned to speak on this Bill today, but as the honourable member for Lilley (Mrs Darling) is ill, I have had to step into the breach. I have listened with a great deal of interest to the debate so far. As I understand it, the Bill seeks to compel anybody who wants to change the Australian flag to hold a referendum. I must say that this is rather novel in the federal sense because, at least up until now, referendums have only been used to try to change the Constitution and, as it has been pointed out, not very successfully. In fact, I think the only time referendums have got up in the past has been when the Labor Party has joined with the Government to ensure that the proposals have been passed.

         If we look at the latest set of referendum proposals, it gives us a fair idea of how much value the Liberal Party and the National Party put on referendums. For those who cannot remember, in 1988 the Government put up four different proposals, one of which was to recognise local government. One would have thought that in the grand scheme of things local government plays a significant part in Australian government, and yet the Liberal Party and the National Party advocated a no vote against recognition of local government in the Australian Constitution. If they are as shameless as that about something as important as the role of local government in Australian government and they advocate a no vote for that, how can they be trusted with anything else?

Obviously, the well-being of the Australian people would be very much more disadvantaged financially by the proposals being put up by the Liberal and National parties to tax food and clothing, and yet there is no talk of a referendum on that. The honourable members of the Opposition are quite happy for those sorts of pieces of legislation to go through this Parliament, but mention the flag and the reaction is, `Oh no, we cannot put that through the Parliament. This Parliament is not representative enough to change the flag', and yet they think food and clothing can be taxed without having recourse to the Australian people.

         I have noticed that today the honourable member opposite introduced another Bill to do with the flag. It seems to me the Liberal Party and the National Party have a fetish about flags when they are in opposition. Between 1975 and 1983 they were the Government. I would have thought that this fetish, had it existed back then, could have been accommodated then. They could have passed legislation then because they controlled the Senate and the House of Representatives. So how is it, here in 1992 when they are in opposition, that they bring up this proposal when they were not prepared to do it when they were in government?

         It seems to me to be self-evident. The honourable members opposite have not much to talk about so here we are talking about the flag. Let us just assume that they are dinkum about this referendum proposal, that there are good reasons for it and forget everything I have said. Consider just the practical difficulties. One assumes, of course, that there is a choice between the existing flag and one other. It may not be. Ausflag, to which the honourable member for Casey (Mr Halverson) referred, had a number of proposals. A referendum cannot sort that out. The mechanics of it just cannot work with a referendum. I think that if we were to change our flag then this Parliament should do it, or it should be announced.

I think the legislation that has been put up is totally unnecessary. I am not going to support it, even though I think that in 1992, as we come towards the year 2001, the 100th anniversary of the Commonwealth, it would be a good time to change the flag, there is no doubt about that. I think Australia in 2001 will be a totally different country to what it was in 1901. The make-up of our population, the aspirations we have, are certainly much different now than they were back then. So for those reasons I would favour a change and also the proclamation of a republic at the same time. It seems that, as we mature as a country and as we make our way in the world, both of those things could happen in 2001.

         I think the change of the flag in Canada actually gave the country a much better identity, or a more identifiable character. It is certainly supported by all the people in Canada now and they would never get a proposition to go back to the old one. I suppose the most visible display of somebody wanting to change the flag occurred at the time of the America's Cup back in 1983 when Mr Bond and the

That sort of thing should not happen, and it really does display to us the fact that the Australian flag just is not doing the job.

         As well as that, he has combined this opposition to our flag with slamming the British. It is interesting to examine why he might be doing this. There probably are a number of reasons. In part, it is his bog Irish coming out. He seems to have a cultural imprint which has imprisoned him with certain prejudices and which has sequestered his mind in such a way that he cannot rise above this irrational and paranoid dislike of everything English. In part, it is also because he wants to create a diversion. This is an old ploy; it has been used back since the time of the French Revolution and probably earlier than that: he wants to create a diversion away from the economic mess this country is in today, with a million jobless and a net overseas debt of $145 billion.

I have to acknowledge that, in creating this diversion, he was largely successful. Also, in part, he has raised this thing of Australia becoming a republic and doing away with our flag because he has wanted to unite the left wing behind him in his own Party. Again, I have to acknowledge that he has been successful. The left wing has been gullible in this. Those who were opposing him only a couple of weeks ago seem, from statements they have made, to have fallen in behind him, though I often wonder where the allegiances of these people lie. I noted, when the Queen was here only last week, that those who have been most often in opposition to her were in the front line to shake her hand and meet her, standing there giggling with excitement and expectation and fawning all over her.

         We decided, naturally enough, that it would be a good idea to have a flag, and we had a competition to choose an Australian flag. There were over 30,000 entries. There was a panel set up to judge the best entries. Five people were chosen because they had similar designs. Those five people were: Mrs A. Dorrington of Perth, Mr E. J. Nuttall of Melbourne, Mr Ivor Evans of Melbourne, Mr Leslie Hawkins of Sydney, and, interestingly enough, Mr W. Stephens of Auckland. So the flag we have today was chosen by the Australian people.

There are seven points on each of the starsâ€”except for the little fifth one on the Southern Crossâ€”representing the six States: one each for the States and one for the two Territories.

We also got our education system and our language from Englandâ€”though I do note that the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) sometimes abuses that. But 75 per cent of Australians still come from that part of the worldâ€”England, Scotland or Ireland. The freedoms that we enjoy, including the freedoms that the Prime Minister enjoys, are based upon that heritage. Why the Prime Minister wants to deny that part of our history is quite beyond me.

        It is totally unambiguous that the Prime Minister wants the flag changed and the Union Jack taken out. But the arguments that he puts are nonsense. Who amongst us has ever been asked by overseas countries, before we do trade with them, whether we are ashamed to have the Union Jack in the corner? It is a very distinctive flag. There are very few distinctive flags in the world. The flags of most nations are only two or three stripes of different colours. Many flags are very similar and there is no demand for them to be changed. It is actually very hard to design a flag. I think the Ausflag competition in 1988 ended up with a design showing the Southern Cross and a yellow stripe along the bottom.

These are the same people who took us from being a colony of Britain and tied us to the apron strings of America, something which I have objected to for many years.

         We are looking at the future. We are living in times of great change and we see enormous instability. There are people I see who are mindlessly applauding what is taking place in the Soviet Union, a Soviet Union that is very slowly groping towards the light, you might say, has been convulsed by what is virtually revolution and is now disintegrating. What we will see out of that as likely as a rise of democracyâ€”in fact, I believe far more likelyâ€”is a rise of Islamic fundamentalism in its Asian provinces and a rise of the new German empire on its western front. Many of those small enclaves that have separated themselves from the Soviet Union are more likely to become fascist states than they are to become democratic. There is no history of democracy there.

There is a tendency amongst the multicultural brigade to say, `All cultures are equal'. This is nonsense. All cultures are not equal. What the British culture has done is give the world the rule of law. It is this that is embodied in the United States. It is this that we have built on.

         I believe that changing the flag would be divisive. I do not see why, in the mad pursuit for some contrived unity, we should change the flag which is supported by the majority to placate a minority. In any case, where is this minority? To go back to multiculturalism, most migrants do not approve of it. Most migrants come to this country in a desire to be Australian. They come here because they see Australia as a place for the future, a place of advantage for their children. In many cases, they do not want to continue the shackles of life in their original country. I believe there is no great pressure from migrants to change the flag. Even if there were, should we as a nation succumb to that pressure? I say certainly not, and certainly not without a referendum.

         I support this Bill, which seeks to have the flag that Australia owns as its own changed only by referendum. In common with you, Mr Deputy Speaker, I spent my schoolboy days standing in a school yard and saying, `I love my country, I salute her flag, I honour her Queen, and I promise to obey her laws'. I did it with all the appropriate actions, in concert with the rest of the school. From my schoolboy perspective, King George VI and later Queen Elizabeth II were on the throne and lived in Buckingham Palace; Sir Robert Menzies lived in Canberra; and Sir Thomas Playford lived in Adelaide. My world was secure. It may not have been goodâ€”the influence may not have been perfectâ€”but I insist that I was proud of it and that those traditions did not leave me warped, humiliated or negative. I felt no cultural cringe in claiming to love my country and salute her flag, and this morning I refuse to apologise for or abandon my heritage and my traditions.

He is right; we did notâ€”we had no need to.

Are we supposed to apologise because the Union Jack is part of the Australian flag? This Union Jack, this symbol which is so much part of our culture, this flag of the nation that gave us our principles of law, our language and our parliamentary institution, is quite appropriately in the corner of our flag. In 1992, when we celebrate a nation now made up of people who are not just those with English origins but those who have come from all around the globe to be part of the Australian community, is it not appropriate that in the top left-hand corner of our flag there should be a symbol of unityâ€”the Union Jack, the coming together of the flags of St Andrew, St Patrick and St George?

       During the recess I came across a well based, sound small business in my electorate that had applied for an increase in its overdraft from $300,000 to $500,000 and had not been able to get it. It is a high-tech firm which was established in Perth, with branches in several Australian capital cities and with a good record of profit. It had always finished each year with substantial profitsâ€”in the last two, for example, $600,000 before tax in 1989-90 and $300,000 before tax in 1990-91. It had a turnover of $8m a year and it was involved in high value business when it applied for this increase in its overdraft. No trading bank would lend it that money. In the ACT the firm has 25 employees and it has a turnover of $1.5m. When the local branch in the ACT requested an overdraft based on its debtor listing, which was a strong list, it was told it could not get the overdraft it sought. It had a prepayment of $0.75m but that, of course, was assigned to the costs of fulfilling a contract. The bank offered to increase the overdraft of the local branch by $100,000, provided it kept $100,000 on deposit and also provided the directors were prepared to guarantee the loan by mortgaging their own houses.

        That is really excessively restrictive. This firm is doing well. It is in a growing area of the high-tech market. It depended on an overdraft to expand. It is not in the business of owning property. Yet the bank said it was prepared to increase its lending only if the firm put property in as security. That really means that that particular firm could not expand and was being throttled by the banks which were lending to it. That is just one example of many instances which I understand have occurred in recent months.

        A look at the statistical record shows that, in the late 1980s, bank lending to business borrowers grew very rapidly, at a rate nearly twice as fast as the growth in deposits. However, the current financial year is likely to reverse that trend dramatically. Bank lending to business borrowers is estimated to expand by a tiny 1 to 2 per cent, so that there is no real growth at all, while deposits this year should expand by more than twice that rate, that is, by over 4 per cent. That means that the banks' resources are being transferred away from business lending.

The bank imposed credit squeeze has exacerbated the already unequal access to finance faced by small businesses in Australia. This unequal access has been long recognised by inquiries such as the 1936 Royal Commission into the Australian Banking and Monetary System from which came, eventually, the Commonwealth Development Bank. Later inquiries such as the 1971 Wiltshire report, the 1981 Campbell report and the 1990 Beddall report have identified a continuing failure of the banks to provide adequate finance to small businesses.

        Fortunately the economic statement last week contained some important measures to break the bank imposed credit squeeze. Most importantly the tax treatment and Reserve Bank rules, which discouraged Australian banks from providing equity capital, have been relaxed. Equity investment by Japanese and German banks plays an important part in their role as long term financiers of manufacturing industry. By taking equity, the Australian banks will now have a stake in the future of their business clients. This means the banks will work harder to make the company a success rather than selling it up as soon as it has a set-back.

        It was only a matter of 10 days ago that the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) announced that the banks are going to take a more generous approach to business in relation to their lending practices. I am pleased that they are saying that, but I have some grave doubts that this is going to come to fruition and I have grave doubts that it is going to apply to small business.

        When one looks at banking practices in the last three to five years, one can only say the banks have a shocking reputation. They have been implementing their own credit squeeze. In doing so they have been threatening the livelihood of thousands of small business families, and they have been forcing people who normally work in these small businesses onto the dole. I can only sum up by saying that many of their attitudes and practices have been anti-Australian.

They have refused to lend to prospective purchasers of existing small businesses. They have been rejecting applications for finance for new businesses. They are refusing to extend overdrafts to small business proprietors. They are refusing to roll loans over. They are no longer capitalising interest. They are refusing to lend on a number of enterprises such as motels and hotels. They have been calling up loans, even though the borrowers have been performing and are continuing to perform. They are refusing requests for normal balloon repayment schemes. In such schemes one takes a five-year loan and has low principal and interest repayments for, say, the first two years. Then, because of the borrower's greater capacity to repay, the payments are rescheduled and increased. They are refusing those structures. They are holding up overdrafts.

It would be my view that this motion should be worded along these lines: `That this House expresses serious concern at the failure of the Government to adequately plan and implement the deregulation of the banking industry, resulting from inappropriate monetary policies and Government response to the economic climate of the time; the maintenance of a tax system which encouraged debt; the inadequate reactive rather than proactive prudential supervision of the banks; and the lax lending policies of the banks in the 1980s'. Then the motion could go on with its wish list of saying, `Please, banks, don't let the pendulum swing too far in a direction opposite to that of the 1980s, given that  it went  far  too  lax  in  that period'.

        What they were doing was a consequence of their complete failure to understand the implications of the deregulation of the banking industry. I support its deregulationâ€”have always supported its deregulation. But one does not deregulate something that has been in a straitjacket for many years, without studying in advance the likely consequences for those involved in the deregulated marketplace and making sure that all the participants are aware of those likely consequences. This Government hastily deregulated the banks, did not think through the likely consequences of it and, as a result of its failure to think them through, its inadequate economic policies during the 1980s, its hopeless tax system in relation to debt and equity during the 1980s, the Government is responsible for what is now occurring in relation to the banks. The banks, too, were not prepared for deregulation. In speeches on the banking committee's report I have said these words:

       In undermining the safety of banks, through lax lending on their part, great pain and suffering were caused for the very people about whom the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) has spoken. It is quite clear that the banks have made strategic mistakes during the 1980s. And it was put this way at a conference on banking held in Sydney earlier this week. Those mistakes included excessive lending to entrepreneurial, real estate and construction companies; a decline in credit standards with risk assessment being clouded by the enticement of high fees and spreads; participation in syndicated loans without applying appropriate credit assessment; and engaging in activities that were not a good fit or which did not have a suitable risk reward ratio.

        I have mentioned risk several times, and it is risk that has been the problem. The banks going after profit, which they are entitled to do, blinded themselves by the euphoria of competition and the drive for market share, to a point where they were not assessing the risks related to the loans. And that was not only at the big end of town, it was right across the spectrum of their loan portfolios. What we found was that, in the early 1980s, credit growth as a whole had been between 15.7 per cent and 18.2 per cent up till 1984. Then what happened on deregulation? In 1985 credit growth rose to 23.2 per cent, to a high in 1988 of 28.2 per cent. Of course, there had to be a market correction. As always occurs when there is a market correction, where it has gone too far one way it goes too far the other way, not only in the macro context but also in the micro circumstances of individual borrowers applying to banks.

        The banks changed their psychology. The bankers did not understand the change nor did their customers. Bankers became marketeers of money, vendors of money, whereas, previously, they had been allocators of rationed funds. The customers went into their banks believing their bankers were their advisers, but the bankers had become salesmen, rather than consultants who could objectively make an assessment of the credibility of the proposition put before them. They wanted to lend their money and they would lend it on high risk ventures. The customer believed that, because the banker would lend the money, the proposition must have been right.

        The honourable member for Fraser and his colleagues spoke as though cocktail loans were new. Cocktail loans existed long before bank deregulation and, in fact, were one of the safety valves as far as customers and banks were concerned, because if one could not get it from the bank out of rationed funds that were lent on a low risk basis, because the risks were higher, one then went to a finance company. One got a risk reward assessment of the proposition and paid in accordance then with the estimated risk.

        Since deregulation the Government has failed the Australian people. It failed them because it said that there were advantages to be gained from deregulationâ€”as there are and there were. But the price that we have paid for that transition from a regulated banking environment to a deregulated one is much higher than it need have been. It is not the banks' fault; it is certainly not wholly their fault. The major people to blame are the members of the Government. The Government did not put in place appropriate economic policies, it did not put in place adequate monetary controls and it did not do what the Reserve Bank said that the authorities normally do, which is to use the banks to moderate cyclical variations.

        Furthermore, it did not put in place an adequate supervisory arrangement. It is my view that, if there had been in place at the time of deregulation a prudential supervisory regime of the sort that is gradually, far too slowly, coming into operation now, the Reserve Bank would have taken a much more stringent and concerned view about what was going on in the way that banks were increasing their bank assets at a percentage far too good for the health of the banking industry as a whole. To the extent that the banking industry became unhealthy, the people who have borne the burden of that problem are the very persons to whom the honourable member for Fraser has referred.

        â€”I would like to take issue with the honourable member for Fraser (Mr Langmore) on one point; that is, that the Government has been successful in reducing interest rates and inflation. Many of us on this side of the House recall that in 1989 and in early 1990, when the former Treasurer, now the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), was pushing interest rates up through the roof, forcing businesses into bankruptcy and forcing home owners out of their homes, at no stage was a policy objective stated as low inflation and low interest rates. The policy was to soak up consumptionâ€”demand for imports. The effect of the fall in interest rates was as a direct consequence of the recession and not a long term policy objective of the Government.

        Poor economic management and forecasting by this Government is directly responsible for the attitude of the banks today.

Banks, as did other businesses, responded to the boom and the Government's lead by increasing lending, particularly for property development on inflated asset prices.

If the Government is prepared to take the tough decisions that are necessary, the banks will respond. Those decisions are in the Fightback package, they are not in its One Nation statement.

        In addressing the question of education assistance for children in the isolated parts of Australia, I believe that I must initially seek to dispel two particular myths which seem very hard to get rid of. The first is that assistance for isolated children, or the AIC scheme, is not some sort of hand-out designed to benefit mainly wealthy graziers so that they can more readily send their children to expensive boarding schools in the big cities. In fact, a wide range of families from isolated parts of this vast and very thinly populated land need access to educational facilities for their children. They include not only farmers, and not only graziers who are by no means wealthy at the moment in the current environment, but also property managers, farm workers, miners, outback shopkeepers, fuel suppliers and so forthâ€”even lighthouse attendants. A whole range of people in isolated situations in this country need access to schools.

      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        Secondly, and I think this is very important to understand, we are not talking here about welfare benefits. Rather, we are talking about access to education, and the very important principle that all Australian children should enjoy the same opportunity to get to the school gate. An example used by the ICPA itself to illustrate the point is that of a Newcastle family, perhaps unlucky enough to fall victim to that terrible earthquake.

        Though their home could be flattened and their car written off and water and gas could be disconnected, with the resulting financial mayhem, the fact is that mum and dad can still put the kids on the school bus, which will take them off for the day in order that they can enjoy access to education.
       </tab>
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        Furthermore, it makes no difference at all whether that family are welfare dependent, at one end of the spectrum, or are wealthier citizens of Newcastle, at the other; access to school is provided on an equal basis. This is not the case for isolated Australians. So far as it is possible to correct the situation, we as a nation must seek to do so, both for reasons of simple justice and fairness and for economic reasons.

      <para first-indent="16">
       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        The justice argument is simple enough. As I have said, all Australian children should have that essential opportunity for an adequate education. If there is no place for them in the bush, they need to be given the skills, the abilities and the capabilities to have an equal footing with their peers from urban areas, from populated areas, to enter the labour market.

      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
        The economic argument is also highly significant. The fact is that a great deal of Australia's export wealth is disproportionately generated by people who live outside the heavily populated areas of Australia. We have a vested interest as a nation in keeping people out there in those mining areas and agricultural areas. It needs to be kept in mind that educated people will, as a rule of thumb, be more productive peopleâ€”the evidence is quite clear on that pointâ€”and that families will not stay in areas where they cannot educate their children. That means that they will not remain productive in those areas, either.

At its peak, some 32,000 children were being assisted, at a cost of some $28m. Today, however, only around 12,000 are receiving assistance, at a cost of around $14m to $15m. The annual decline in numbers is of the order of 1,000 children, which, I imagine, reflects in no small part the already very worrying level of exodus from the bush.

        Over the years from 1973 the base allowance slipped away from that level of 55 per cent of average boarding costs to a low of just 21 per cent, in the face of consistent inflationâ€”the great cancer that this Government refused to properly address, let alone acknowledge, until it landed us in a recession or, can I say, a depression in the bush and it became convenient to point towards broken inflation as a big plus. As Max Walsh pointed out, inflation always is low in a depression.

        Two years ago the Government, to its credit, increased the base boarding allowance to the non-means and non-assets tested portion to $1,500, which brought its value back up to 32 per cent of average boarding costs. Then, in the first of many lifts from our Fightback package, the Government increased the base to $2,500, or 51 per cent of average boarding costs. That was done just before Christmas. That very considerable improvement is greatly appreciated by isolated families; they commend the Government for it and so do I.

        Unfortunately, more help is needed. The total amount available to those in need who pass the means test and claim the second tier or, as it is known, the additional boarding allowance was increased by just $150 to $3,354; that is to say, all isolated children as defined receive the base boarding allowance of $2,500 and, if they are eligible, some additional $850 is made available, to a ceiling of $3,354.

        The trouble with that is that most of those in deepest need were already able to claim that much before the increase in the base. They are no further ahead now than they were before the increase was announced before Christmas. If they are ahead, it is only by the order of $150-odd. That needs to be contrasted with the average boarding cost across Australia, which is now some $4,969 per student per year. In New South Wales, for example, State boarding schools charge $5,550 per year, and in Western Australia the Government hostels charge $4,900 per year. Probably it needs to be kept in mind as well that about 80 per cent of children cannot access these State boarding facilities in the first place.

        For some unknown reason, the maximum allowance is apparently tied to the maximum level in Austudyâ€”the Austudy living at home allowance rate, which does seem to me to be totally irrelevant. Firstly, most of these children are not able to stay at homeâ€”that is precisely the point. Secondly, Austudy is an income support scheme designed to help kids stay at school, whereas the AIC is a mechanism to enable children to get to the school gate, to give them access to educational facilities.

        Another major stumbling block remains, inasmuch as the assets test on the additional boarding allowance remains. We have committed ourselves to abolishing that because it is an anomaly, and it does have a very restrictive effect on the availability of this aid for isolated children. It is obviously not a fair test. A city family left without income can still access local schools on free, or very low cost, school buses and trains, regardless of the value of their assets. Therefore, isolated families should be freed of the assets test.

        Assistance to isolated children was, in fact, brought in in 1973 when there were 32,000 recipients. It was brought in by the Whitlam Government. At that time, the allowance made to children was about 55 per cent of the average boarding costs. By December 1990, there were 12,948 isolated children and there would be even fewer today. I think those figures themselves tell a story, for this motion goes far beyond just the content of the motion. It gets to the heart of what is happening in Australia.

        I believe Australia is in great danger of dividing as a nation. At a time when there is talk about unity, we have a situation where we are having people in the countryâ€”an area where most of Australia's wealth is still generated fromâ€”in danger of becoming second-class citizens. The city is becoming affluent and the country is becoming more prone to poverty. This is an untenable situation; it is a situation that will divide this nation. I believe it has to be addressed. I think the Government is to be commended for increasing the non-means tested allocation to isolated children to $2,500. It has once again restored it to about 55 per cent of boarding costs.

        I mainly want to speak about the non-means tested section, because I do not think it is clearly understood what we are about. There are two issues. One is access to schools. Every student in Australia should have access; and in my view it should be equal access. The other issue is income support. Parents in the country have the problem of getting education for their children. They have to bear a cost which is not borne by people in the cities. Therefore I think the non-means tested allocation should be the full average boarding cost across Australia. That would work out to a shade under $5,000, and I would be quite happy to round it off to $5,000. The payment of that amount would restore some access and equity to the system.

        However, the truth is that the richest people in Australia can send their children to school in the cities of Australia for virtually nothing. The richest people in Australia living in the country face considerable costs. The richest people can obviously afford it, but there are many people in the bush who simply cannot. The figures from ABARE indicate that in this current financial year 30 per cent of primary producers will have a negative income. There is a very grave danger that those people will withdraw their children from school. Their children's education will therefore suffer at a time when we are trying to build a clever country. If we are going to have a clever country we need to have clever people in those industries which are vital to Australia. There are no industries more vital to Australia today than the mining and the agricultural industriesâ€”the very industries that are threatened by the cost of education.

        The benefits are considerable. If the education of these children were improved, it would mean that with increased efficiency in rural areas and an increasing decline in population, they would be equipped to get jobs in the cities. It would mean that if they stayed on the land they would be more efficient in their production of the export income that Australia desperately needs. It seems strange to me that, when the cost of providing this equity is so small, we do not do more about it. As the previous speaker said, if we were to grant the ICPA its entire wish list it would come to about $20m, or some $7m less than it would have cost in 1987. That would be $20m that would be very well spent. It would do more to help restore equity and unity to this nation than virtually any other expenditure I can think of.

I notice in my brother's children, even today, a shyness and a reluctance to meet people. We ought to be investing a lot more in isolated education.

        There is a lot of confusion between the assistance for isolated children and Austudy. Austudy is about income support. It should be totally independent of any assistance to isolated children. Any assistance to isolated children should not be counted when looking at Austudy calculations. As I have said, all that the assistance for isolated children does is provide them with entry to the school gate. We have not yet got to full compensation. I certainly hope that we can move in that direction. The costs vary considerably across Australia. I am told that at the convent in Quilpie a child can board for something like $2,900 a year. That sounds rather austere. In Western Australia, the average cost for government boarding schools is about $4,900. In New South Wales it is somewhat higher, but that seems to be an average figure.

That is something that the country should not baulk at or shy away from. As a nation, if we are going to have unity, we must have equity in the system, and equity is certainly overdue to these people.

That is nonsense. We certainly cannot convince the people who are driving buses around some of our cities that they are not working very hard. In fact, they are working harder than many people. What we should realise is that work in the country produces lots of jobs in the city. If city people can be taught how much their jobs, their employment, and the affluence in the cities rest on people who develop things in the country, then I believe we will be well on the way to giving the sort of justice to country people that is long overdue.

It seems to me that, when we talk about this issue of assistance for isolated children, we talk about not an issue of access but one of equity. There is a lack of equity because we cannot afford to build primary schools, secondary schools and tertiary institutions through the outback of this great and vast nation. Any support of equity demands that we support those families who inhabit the vast regions of Australia, who contribute to our wealth and contribute to our social cohesion, as a matter of equity, by making sure that their children can afford to go to school.

It is interesting, but not funny, that DEET advises us that in 1990-91 the expenditure on AIC was $15.5m, $0.824m less than the appropriation, because both the average benefit and the number of students assisted were less than had been estimated.

For the children of parents who live a long way away from all three levels of schooling, both assistance for isolated children and Austudy are a matter of means but not a matter of assets. One might own several hundred thousand square miles and not have a cracker to be able to afford to send one's children to school, or afford even the correspondence course.

        This is an issue that all members of parliament who represent country electorates and regional electorates have been conscious of and have been pressing for. It has come back to a matter of funds, but this Government has acted in providing another $8.6m to underpin these costs and to ensure that young people in isolated areas can get to school. I agree that there is always need for more, because even $2,500 is not very much when one is trying to send a person of 15 or 16 off to secondary school.

        The Government has seen fit to ensure that, if a family wants to buy into a second home or rent a second home, these moneys are still payable. Whilst the honourable member for La Trobe talks about assets tests, it needs to be placed on the record that this Government is conscious of the problems that he mentioned about someone owning so many hundreds of square miles of land but having no income, because only half the value of the asset is taken into consideration. Also, there are times when the assets test is not even considered. Under the rural adjustment scheme, if a rural family is on a pension, then there are special exemptions again. So the Government is conscious of the problems. This has been seen in the fact that these latest increases are going to benefit some 8,500 students across Australia.

The Opposition is acknowledging that, the organisation is acknowledging that and the families are acknowledging that, but we do need to reconsider the situation further. There are real problems in geographical isolation. There are real problems when families are trying to eke out an existence working in those small isolated areas. I have in my electorate towns such as St Lawrence, 150 kilometres from Mackay and 105 kilometres from Rockhampton, virtually in the middle of nowhere, which are facing major problems. Many of these people work for local authorities; they work in the council areas; they work on properties. But they do not have the assets to go and borrow.

         One has to say that to a certain extent Canberra brings it on itself. There is no better measure of this than its voting patterns. For example, in 1990 the coalition actually gained a majority of the vote Australia-wide but did not gain a majority of seats. However, the vote in Canberra was out of kilter with trends in the rest of Australia.

          When those 1990 election results came out, I was reminded of what happened in the United States of America in 1984 when President Reagan was running for re-election and he was opposed by a previous Vice-President of the United States, Walter Mondale. Mondale carried the vote in only two parts of the United States, his home state of Minnesota and Washington, DC. Given that the vote was so far out of kilter with the rest of the United States of America, a friend of mine, who is American, said that he found it fairly depressing to think that the policy-makers in Washington, DC, could be so far out of step with the sentiment and feelings of virtually the rest of the United States of America.

         The Gold Coast is stereotyped as wealthy and, on occasions, some of that wealth having been earned in questionable ways. There are a large number of wealthy people on the Gold Coast. There are two good reasons: first, it is the best part of Australia to live so that, when people get the opportunity to retire, it is their number one choice for retirement and quite a number of wealthy people take their retirement wealth to the Gold Coast. The second thing is that it is a beautiful place to visit, and probably the most desirable place to live is either on the beach front or on the riverfront.

         Tourists go to the Gold Coast and they walk on the beaches and they see some conspicuous consumption by the local residents. They go for boat cruises and, similarly, they see the beautiful mansions that are on the riverbank. But people forget that they can go to Sydney and see wondrous mansions on Sydney Harbour and not see the western suburbs of Sydney or Redfern or other places such as that. There is conspicuous consumption on the Gold Coast and it is very apparent. But all objective factual measures indicate that that is totally atypical of the community.

         We recently had a census done and I am looking forward to the analysis by electorates of the various statistics that usually come out of a census. The 1986 pattern showed that the residents of the two Federal electorates of Moncrieff and McPherson, for example, ranked amongst the lowest in Australia in average household income. The stereotype of wealth is not borne out by that basic statistic. However, the statistics show a few other very important facts about the Gold Coast. They show that the residents of the two Gold Coast electorates have the fewest number of government employees as a percentage of their work force. In other words, we are not pork-barrelled by government, either State or Federal. The wealth and the jobs that are created locally are created by private enterprise.

         The statistics also show that employees there basically work in small business. We have the highest proportion of all Federal electorates of people either self-employed or working for small enterprises. So the Gold Coast is very much small business driven. That is against the stereotype of the five-star hotels which are very important employers. However, in the sense that they are significant employers, and one hopes that is a part of the economy that will grow because they bring in tourists who spend a lot of money and the benefits flow, they are atypical of the pattern of employment and of industry on the Gold Coast.

         Because we have basically a tourism industry and a small business economy, we have a very low-paid work force. A very large proportion of the work force works in retailing and in tourism, which are two areas of relatively low pay. The fact is that many people who live on the Gold Coast are retirees who are self-funded, pensioners, or living on very modest superannuation. That brings with it very particular needs, and an area of need which is becoming acute is that of aged care and the health needs of the aged.

         Very recently the local State regional health authority released a report which tipped a huge bucket on both the State Government and the Federal Government for the underfunding of health care in the Gold Coast region. Just a little while ago I wrote a letter to the Minister for Aged, Family and Health Services (Mr Staples) in which I pointed out that the Blue Nursing Service on the Gold Coast, despite having to cope with nearly twice as many cases as allowed for by the level of funding that was struck back in 1984, is getting no more money. The Minister in his reply said that in the area of aged care he was looking at the capacity of people to look after themselves, and not just the raw data. He did not go on to say, `Mrs Sullivan, you come from the Gold Coast and we all know everybody is dripping wealth there. What about their paying for their own aged care?', but the whole tone of the letter implied that.

         Briefly, because my time is nearly expired, I have to say that the figures will also show that the most rapid growth in youth unemployment in Australia is on the Gold Coast. It is not the stereotyped surfie dole bludger; not at all. It is local young people who can no longer turn to the traditional small business employer for jobs. Certainly the tourism industry is still doing well, and it is an important employer of young people. But the second area, and a far more significant area traditionally, is that of small business. Small business is collapsing at a record rate on the Gold Coast, because people are frightened of the future. Many people are unemployed, many people's neighbours have become unemployed, and they have become frightened of what that means. Small business is going bankrupt.

Over the past few days we have seen the Opposition in this Parliament doing this in regard to the Treasury's analysis of its so-called Fightback program.

         Of course, we know that BHP will not upset Indonesia as it hopes to profit from oil in the Timor Gap. But, far from gaining favour with Indonesia, this lie by BHP has embarrassed Indonesia. It is not that it was a mistakeâ€”it was a deliberate lie. According to Krakatau Steel, an official from BHP visited Indonesia in late December. Indonesia at that stage indicated that it had not cancelled any steel order. Why then did BHP put out a press statement, on 3 January 1992, saying that, because of militant union activity, it had lost an $8m steel contract? It did this for one reason and one reason alone: it was an exercise in union bashing. It was an attempt to portray the union in the worst possible light as a wrecker of Illawarra jobs. It was an especially vindictive attack on the Secretary of the South Coast Labour Council, Paul Matters. As Paul Matters has said, BHP's decision to blame the union for the loss of Krakatau's interest in the steel contract was nothing more than a propaganda exercise. That is what it was, a propaganda exercise. Like all propaganda, it is based on lies. Perhaps we can add another name to the Big Australianâ€”the Big Australian as the big liar.

         â€”We are hearing a lot today about buy Australian and be Australian and Australian made and so on. I direct a few remarks to points that appear to me as a grievance with regard to the need for us to be more Australian and, by looking back on our colourful Australian heritage, to find out a little bit more about how we can be more Australian. Of course, to look back over our history, we have a period that is called our `wild colonial days'. This is equal to and, in many ways, surpasses that of nearly every other country in the world. Unfortunately, this period is almost totally ignored by our education system and by many bodies which ought to be doing more about bringing it to the attention of the Australian people. I have in my electorate a very colourful, well known and excellent historian, Edgar Penzig, who gets a lot of help from his wife, Megan. He has written quite a few good books that make excellent reading. I am sure some people have heard of
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Morgan the murderer

         For example, hundreds and thousands of school children seem unaware that mail was carried overland by horseback between Melbourne and Yass, before it finished the trip by coach, and this was 23 years before the American pony express began operations in the early 1860s. Australia had the richest goldfields, especially of the alluvial type, ever found in the world. Likewise, we had the largest pure gold nugget and the largest quartz-gold nugget, the Beyers-Holtermann nugget, found at Hill End in New South Wales. We had towns with larger populations and many more hotels than any in the so-called American Wild West.

         Also, the American Wild West outlaws take a back seat to the local variety, which were known as bushrangers. For instance, Jesse James in the American Wild West committed 21 hold-ups in 16 years, whereas our notorious bushranger John Gilbert, nicknamed Happy Jack, committed over 630 robberies in just over four years. The villain Ben Hall committed over 600 robberies, as did many others, such as Morgan the Murderer and Fred Ward, alias Thunderbolt. All honourable members, and especially the right honourable member for New England (Mr Sinclair), would know all about Thunderbolt's history. All those bushrangers had tallies of several hundred. As for Ned Kelly, his tally was only about a dozen. If he had not put that tin over his head, we probably would not even have heard of him again.

         In the American Western period several people carried five revolvers, a few dozen carried two and the majority carried one. One can compare this with John Gilbert, Ben Hall and company, who were always armed with six or eight. In one hold-up Hall had nine pistols and revolvers in his belt. No American outlaw ever held up a whole town, but the Gilbert-Hall gang held up three country towns during their infamous careers.

         The coaching history of our country also surpasses all others. In the early 1870s, every day Cobb and Co. was putting 6,000 horses into harness and its coaches were travelling 28,000 miles every week. Mr Penzig points out that miles is the proper language. That local firm was the largest of its kind in the world. It was larger than Wells Fargo and the Adam Express Co. of the United States put together. On top of that, we had the largest coaches in the world. The biggest in America's west carried 36 passengers, which is not a bad load for a coach, whilst the Australian model, of which two were made, built in about 1860, were pulled by 22 horses and weighed in at 5 tonsâ€”not tonnes, as Mr Penzig points out. They carried 89 passengers and were the largest horse-drawn vehicles ever constructed in the world.

         Yet, in spite of all this, we are still served up a meal of nothing but American Western-style films, television, comics, et cetera.

         Naturally, because our population sees many television films from overseas, the majority being from the United States of America, we have also lost much of our local idiomâ€”our local terms and our way of speaking. What has been a tin in Australia since 1850, in the past 25 years has turned into an American can. What was a good bloke is now a good guy. All the teenagers and, unfortunately, many adults are using that word because of the influence of television in every home. The mudguards on all our motor cars are turning into fenders overnight. What was the bonnet of the motor car ever since the car was invented has, over the years, turned into a hood. All our headmasters during the same span of time have turned into American principals. Our universities in the last 10 years or so have now discovered a campus, which has never existed in any Australian university in the history of our country.

One of the terms we have used ever since the 1850s is the goods train, but in the past two years we have begun to hear from newsreaders and to read in our papers `freight train'.

There is one song which contains the words, `It's an Australian institution, the Australian barbeque'. In Australia from the 1850s we have had a boree-log, not a barbeque.

We used to put petrol into our motor cars, but many petrol stations now advertise gas. For the uninformed, petrol is a liquid, not a gas. Instead of wearing moleskins, which will outlast 10 pairs of Yankee jeans, every Australian youth and many adults wear the latter. Even one of our leading country entertainers, who continually talks about Australia getting a new flag and becoming a republic, always appears at his concerts and public appearances wearing a denim shirt, jeans and striped jogging boots. He needs to have a good look at himself before he starts talking about these things that are so precious to a lot of people in this country.

         â€”As you wish, Madam Deputy Speaker. I withdraw it. The National Party, in my couple of years in this place, has shown itself to be absolutely incapable of effectively putting the views of country people. That absolute inability is shown very effectively by the lack of performance in the production of the Opposition's Fightback program. That program has absolutely no initiatives that are likely to be of advantage to country and rural people, or the people of my electorate on the north coast. The National Party really needs to comprehend the types of people who make up its electorates. It has not done this and it has been snowballed by the Liberal Party. The Liberal Party, which represents the wealthy city electorates, has dominated the Fightback statement. The National Party members have lain down like dogs and allowed themselves and their electorates to be crushed.

         On the other hand, when we examine the proposals and the initiatives of the One Nation program we find many initiatives that are of real and direct benefit to the people of the north coast of New South Wales and to rural and country people throughout Australia. The National Party really needs to understand how its electorates are composed, and the sorts of categories that its constituents fall into. My electorate, which would not be very different from many National Party electorates, is made up predominantly of low income earners. It comprises families on low incomes, pensioners and elderly people, small business people, with the emphasis on `small', and small farmersâ€”once again with the emphasis on `small'. What has the National Party done? It has agreed to a stance that favours the rich at the expense of the low to middle income earners of Australiaâ€”the very people who make up its constituency.

         â€”The presentation we have just heard from the honourable member for Page (Mr Harry Woods) prompts me to move away from what I was about to say. It is a terrific example of the tragedy that has beset this country during the nine years of the Labor Government. He has only been here a short time, so he cannot be held personally responsible for the tragedy that still goes on today. In fact, the current Prime Minister (Mr Keating), if he were an Indian, would today be called Chief Rising Dust because his Party has been surrounded by a cloud of rising dust now for a considerable time.

It is a perennial problem which my duty to my constituents demands be constantly brought to the attention of this Parliament. I refer to the recurrent urban flooding suffered by many thousands of people on the central coast of New South Wales.

Wide media coverage and visits by our nation's leaders were orders of the day.

         Fortunately, this sort of flooding normally occurs once or twice a decade, and usually affects only a couple of thousand citizens. In Robertson, severe flooding has become a way of life. Some 8,000 of my constituents get flooded each and every year. Some are inundated as many as three times in a year. They suffer exactly the same destruction of their houses, as floodwaters destroy floor coverings and furniture and put their lives at risk, as well as the lives of their loved ones. Very little notice is taken of this widespread devastation because it happens so often. Regrettably it is no longer news.

         On 9 and 10 February last, a severe rain storm following two days of soaking rain caused devastating flooding in Narara and Erina Creeks. Flood levels were higher on Narara Creek than they have been recorded in living memory.

The industrial area of North Gosford in Brooks Avenue suffered badly with indications of more than 1 metre. Night shift workers at the Angel Pie Co. were given only moments notice of the onrush and were forced to swim to higher ground in water infested with leeches and snakes. Their cars were submerged in the car park. Management lost thousands of dollars in lost product, ingredients, production and damage to machinery. The Gosford City bowling lanes are a total loss with a full rebuilding program necessary. In the Showground Road area the water level in houses was well above the windows. The West Gosford industrial properties between Manns Road and Narara Creek suffered similar damage. The Tascott Basin and Point Clare area also suffered similar damage with Brisbane Water Drive cut for a considerable period and many houses flooded.

         The torrential rain the following weekend also caused severe flooding in the Narara and Erina Creek areas and resulted in substantial damage to the city's road network. Council staff were kept busy dealing with numerous emergency calls reporting damage and seeking assistance. Substantial damage to road shoulders and major scouring occurred along Brisbane Water Drive with localised flooding of properties. Similar damage occurred at Empire Bay, Green Point, Copacabana, Woy Woy, Pearl Beach and Umina. Road closures were required at various sites in Gosford including Showground Road, Avoca Drive, Terrigal Drive, Brunswick Road and the Pacific Highway at West Gosford.

         I want to give particular attention today to what happened at Tascott on the morning of 9 January this year by way of illustrating just how dangerous this flooding has become. On that morning a severe flood not only caused extensive property damage but also a washaway on the main northern railway line from Sydney to Newcastle. A disaster of the dimensions of the Granville rail disaster was narrowly averted that morning. My constituents advise me that some three minutes before the ballast between the tracks was washed across Brisbane Water Drive, a northbound electric passenger train crossed the area of the washaway. If that train had been a few minutes later and coincided with the arrival of a southbound goods train, then the chances are that they both would have tumbled into the Brisbane Waters with catastrophic results.

         The problem at Tascott has been critically dangerous for several years. It is the usual story of several government authorities buck-passing and refusing to get their act together. The flooding is caused by three totally inadequate culverts. The first under Glenrock Parade is the responsibility of the Gosford City Council. It has five cells at the moment and Webb McKeown Engineering Consultants reported to Council in 1989 that a larger culvert was required. They also told the Rail Authority that it had to install a new culvert under the railway line and the New South Wales Road Traffic Authority that a new culvert was required under Brisbane Water Drive.

I attended and agreed to take up their cause with the authorities in question and immediately wrote letters to the New South Wales Ministers for roads and railways as well as the Gosford City Council. Gosford City Council was no problem. It readily agreed to allocate funds and got on with the job of building the culvert at Glenrock Parade.

        No joy from Wal Murray. On 28 February 1992, I got a letter from Mr Baird, the Minister for Transport in New South Wales, responsible for the railway line that washed away. He said that Tascott presently rates seventh in the current list of 13 culvert amplification priorities in that area. As I say, a huge loss of human life was very narrowly averted, and yet that priority is only seventh out of 13. The people of Tascott are certainly getting no joy from the State Government of New South Wales, although their lives are being ruined by this constant flooding and risk to lives of other people.

         If these sorts of disasters are to be averted, then I think it is time for the New South Wales Government to take up the proposals in the One Nation policy that relate to our national rail system. A great deal of money was being given in that proposal which will allow railways like that in New South Wales to give priority to the sorts of works that involve questions of human safety and the loss of lives in disasters. I would hope that Mr Baird and Mr Murray can see fit, having been given all this money for both roads and railways, to change their priorities on behalf of the long-suffering people of Robertson, who have been flooded far too often and who deserve a far better go.

         â€”I must compliment the honourable member for Robertson (Mr Walker) on his measured, rational and balanced approach to representing his constituents in the speech that he just gave to the House. I think it contrasted rather amazingly with the excited shoutings of the honourable member for Page (Mr Harry Woods), the previous speaker on the Government side, who tended to devote the whole of his time to attacking the National Party. But I suppose that is fair enough in politics; and my intention when I came in today was to talk about the conduct of parliament to a certain extent.

         While I certainly believe in lively debateâ€”there must be an exchange of views across the chamberâ€”I happen to be one of those who think that if one is going to be a parliamentarian, and a member of the national Parliament above all, one has to learn to play the ball and not the man. Our prime offender in this way is the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), who does really rant and rave. He has given up the `scumbag' vocabulary, it seems, since he has taken on the new aura of dignityâ€”dignity?â€”of Prime Minister, and he does not use that sort of abusive language quite as much. I notice, too, that in the five months that he spent in the wilderness on the back bench before he became Prime Minister he must have spent a great deal of that time standing in front of a mirror learning how to smile. I have known him for seven years. He has smiled more since the coup which put poor old Bob out than he did in the previous seven years. His minders are certainly looking after him to that extent.

         But it is important that the people of Australia should realise that this is a place where there is exchange and interjection. I often find that people who come and visit Question Time, particularly the kids from visiting schools, say, `If we behaved like that at school, we would be in real trouble'. Question Time needs to be improved, because at the present time Question Time in this House of Representatives is not producing the sort of parliamentary behaviour or the activity that it should. What the people of Australia should realise is that there is a very good reason for it.

         Questions should be answered. Unfortunately, we have a front bench of Government Ministers who specialise in not answering questions, unless they are asked by members of their own side. In that case the Minister's office has already written the question and passed it out to the backbencher so that the Minister has the answer already prepared in front of him. Anybody from the public who has been here at Question Time can see that any one of those Ministers, when they answer a question from their own side, has the answers already written out. Surprise!

         Of course, when they get a question from the Opposition benches they make no attempt to answer the question. Rather, they say what they want to say and completely ignore the question. The reason the Opposition is vociferous about this matter is that, if a Minister is making the most outrageous claims and saying the most outrageous untruths, then if we do not reject those claims that implies acceptance. If I were to say that 99 per cent of the members of the Labor Government have AIDS, they would jump up and down. Look at their horrified faces. Of course, it is wrong, and we should properly reject that. Equally, the Opposition in doing its job for Australia has an obligation not to let the untruths and, quite frankly, the false claims go by unchallenged. That is why Question Time is fairly noisy.

         I listened with great attention to the honourable member for Page in his contribution. As I said just a moment or two ago, he seemed to spend all of his time attacking the National Party. It comes back to the question of truth. It is the question of truth that is of prime importance in this Parliament. On the one hand we have the Liberal and National parties' Fightback package and, on the other, the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has produced his One Nation answer to it. Quite frankly, it is only a half-baked answer. In the last few days we have had the Government doing nothing else but attack the Opposition, not trying to sell the benefits of what it is trying to produce with its One Nation policies, but telling the most outrageous untruth about what the Fightback package will do. The Government has based this on an analysis which uses different ground rules. We cannot compare fish with beef and we cannot compare what Labor is saying about Fightback with the actual truth that it does contain.

It is a false statement. The Government has doctored the books to produce a result which gives the answers that it wants. As Benjamin Disraeli said, `There are lies, damned lies and statistics'. What we have with this present Labor Government is a perversion of the use of statistics to produce answers for its own ends which have nothing to do with truth or reality. I am delighted to see the honourable member for Petrie (Mr Johns) sitting at the table because only yesterday he gave this House the figure that youth unemployment was only 8.8 per cent.

That is the real figure for young people who want a job and cannot get a job. But if we clog up the books with all of those still at school, all of those at TAFE, all of those doing other courses, who are not in the labour market, and who are not looking for a job, then we can come down to 8.8 per cent. But bear in mind that the Bureau of Statistics says the correct unemployment rate for youth in Australia is 34.8 per cent.

         That is not only a shame, it is an outrageous disgrace that the kids of this country have been put into this situation. They have been put into this situation deliberately by the Prime Minister, and the man who was Treasurer for all those years since 1983. It was his recession, his policies, that have done this. This is the recession that we had to have. We have one million people unemployed. A figure of 10.6 per cent of the work force is unemployed.

         The next thing that will happen is that the honourable member for Petrie will fiddle the books again and tell us that the unemployment rate is only 2.5 per cent. That is what it would be if one used the same basis that was used for the other figures. The honourable member for Petrie is not being consistent, he is not doing it properly and he is not telling the truth of it. That is the problem with the Labor Party and this Government. They are distorting the truth every time they open their mouths. It is not for the good of Australia. It is for the good of one man; it is for the good of the Prime Ministerâ€”One Nation: one job. We have to look at all of Australia and not just at the sectional groups. There is no doubt that in the coalition's Fightback package there are just so many things of great benefit to everybody. The Labor Government says in the `One Broke Nation' statement that it has reduced sales tax on motor vehicles, on sedans, from 20 per cent to 15 per cent. The choice of 15 per cent is not just by accident; that is what the GST will be. That does not apply to four-wheel drive vehicles and it does not apply to utilities. People in a business of any shape or form should understand that, under Fightback, if they need to buy a car to run that business, they will not pay a 15 per cent sales tax; they will pay no tax. The GST is rebatable for business inputs. This goes right along the line. Every Australian family will benefit from the abolition of the fuel excise. For my personal car, I will be paying 19c a litre less under Fightback and every business will pay 26c a litre less under Fightback.

         â€”There is a great possibility that one of the crucial issues at the next Federal election will be immigration and Australia's intake. We have already had attempts by the Opposition to give subliminal or code messages to the Australian electorate. This is obviously an attempt to utilise a degree of racism in the community, a concern with the change in our intake and increased stress on Asian migration. That code will say that we will insist upon a greater requirement of English with regard to who comes here. It will ignore, and it will not emphasise to the Australian public, the reality that countries such as Malaysia and Hong Kong are characterised by very high levels of English usage. Some longer term communities in this country, particularly from Europe, are already complaining that the current emphasis on English discriminates against those European countries in favour of Asia.

         As I said, we are seeing an attempt to give a very coded message to the Australian public that by requiring English we will change the intake. The facts of life are that in recent weeks the corporate sector in this country has said that it will not allow that if the Opposition is elected. Already some companies have said that they will take a stronger position with regard to supporting a heavy intake because of Australia's requirements.

The honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) strutted around Sydney's Vietnamese community a few weeks ago telling it that it is the greatest thing since sliced bread, that it has done so much for Australia, that we love it and that the people are beautiful.

         , James Coughlan clearly calculated and looked at the movement of those communities in Sydney. Of course, the reality is that there is a very heavy concentration still in Cabramatta, but a distribution of those communities throughout Sydney has also occurred. One of the greatest increases, of course, has occurred in the municipality of Auburn within my electorate, which, as of the 1986 census, accounted for 7.4 per cent of the total Vietnamese population in New South Wales. That particular community represents about 15 per cent of those born overseasâ€”and I am not talking about their childrenâ€”who in turn are 35 per cent of Auburn municipality's population.

         Of course, with this growing population there is a need to provide services, and the Auburn Asian Welfare Centre is one group that is attempting to do that. The Centre's efforts have been characterised by great diligence; it is not a typical social workers' situation, with people sitting around drinking cups of coffee and empire building by stacking the local community committee with friends and other social workers. This is a group that has done a very thorough effort for the community. It was characterised by its document entitled

         That survey, of course, followed a very important government inspired effort from the Administrative Review Council which looked at the Vietnamese community in Melbourne and the Turkish community in Sydney. It showed that, despite the urban myths about how everyone is on social security and everyone is unemployed, there is a great lack of knowledge in the Vietnamese community about their access to government organisations. For instance, in 1990 only 11 per cent of the Vietnamese community in Melbourne knew of the existence of the Ombudsman and only 13 per cent knew of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal.

         What we saw in that study by the Administrative Review Council, over the period 1990-1991, by using Vietnamese newspapers and by using phone-ins, public meetings and the three half-hours the Vietnamese have on Melbourne radio, was an attempt to demonstrate to the community their rights of appeal and their access to these government bodies, and to see whether in that effort the knowledge would spread. Certainly by the end of that year knowledge of the Ombudsman increased from 11 per cent to 35 per cent and of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal from 13 per cent to 23 per cent. That survey demonstrated a very great need. It came up with a lot of suggestions for both communities in regard to what government bodies should do to publicise their availability.

         The Auburn Asian Welfare Centre relates to those problems.

That Government, of course, has made very dramatic attempts to castrate the western Sydney area assistance scheme in the last few yearsâ€”eventually being forced to back down, of course.

         Anyway, this group started from that funding in 1989 and it has produced the profile I earlier commented on. What it showed was a need for a variety of activities by the local council and government authorities. Included amongst those was a general community service agency. It was found that the fact that Cabramatta had such a high Vietnamese population meant that government agencies tended to depend upon people getting on a train and going up to Cabramatta; there were no local agencies that had these services. It said that the group itself should seek funding for bilingual staff; that local services should be responsive to avoid this travelling; and that there should be specific labour market programs, because one of the realities is a very high unemployment situation in the Vietnamese community, way over the Australian average. At the time of the comparative survey the Australian average was 8.8 per cent, against a Vietnamese rate of over 30 per cent. The report said that government bodies should attempt to make labour programs specifically designed for those communities, and thatâ€”

         â€”On Tuesday of last week, a large gathering of members of parliament, the diplomatic corps, the Public Service, Canberra clergy and other persons attended the annual parliamentary service held at St Christopher's Cathedral in Forrest. A greeting was given by Mr John Langmore, MP, the President of the Parliamentary Christian Fellowship, which incidentally has a membership of almost 80 at the moment. Lessons were read by the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Howe) and the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson). The address was given by the Reverend David Gill, General Secretary of the Australian Council of Churches. Mr Gill centred his address on the wisdom of Solomon. He said:

       <para font-size="-=2">
        King Solomon was a person wearing the mantle of national leadership whose primary concern was not with personal self-interest, not with his party's performance in the latest polls, not with the fluctuating value of the shekel or the trials and tribulations of the Jerusalem stock exchange. Solomon's yearning was for wisdom and a capacity to discern the good.
       </para>
       <para>
        Based on that wisdom, Mr Gill said, the true leader in the political or any other sphere is one who lifts people's eyes to the distant horizon, who inspires us with a vision of what could be, who is driven by a deeply held conviction of what ought to be great wisdom. I commend the address to honourable members and seek leave to table a copy of it.

         â€”This morning I was pleased to present to this House a petition signed by 2,334 Australians, all of whom objected strongly to resource security legislation for major new industrial wood processing projects. They also called on this House to support the preparation of an ecologically sustainable national forest and forestry strategy for Australia. The last point is important because unless our forestry industry is placed on a sustainable footing it will, in time, disappear.

         Indeed, a combination of existing unsustainable logging practices, increased usage of capital-intensive as opposed to labour-intensive technology, and the lack of a real plantations policy has led to enormous job losses in this industry over recent decades. Resource security legislation will not reverse the trend of job losses unless there is a real commitment by governments around Australia to move out of old growth native forests and into plantations.

         It is possible to have a viable forestry industry and a world-class network of national parks. To suggest that the creation of new parks will destroy the industry is utter nonsense. The Resource Assessment Commission's draft report on the Australian forestry industry supports this view. I am sure that the 2,334 people who signed that petition also supported it. It is obvious that in this time of unacceptably high unemployment the Australian public still understands that jobs and protection of the environment are totally compatible and rejects the notion that the environment no longer matters.

         â€”I strongly support the efforts of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on the Australian Security Intelligence Organization to make ASIO more open and accountable. As a minimum, it should be forced to conform to the disclosure provisions of the Archives Act. The Hilton bombing tragedy showed that ASIO is virtually unaccountable. ASIO was at least partly responsible for a gross breach of security in the middle of one of the biggest security operations ever mounted in this country. People were killed and maimed in the main street of our largest city and in a place which was the focus of the security effort. One would have expected that such an event would be fully and openly investigated by the Commonwealth to see where our security forces went wrong, to find out what mistakes were made and who made them. But it has not happened. The closed inquiries have satisfied no-one but the security forces themselves, and have generated endless theories and speculation about the truth.

         The failure of the Attorney-General to announce a full and open inquiry into the Hilton bombing is indefensible. Institutional secrecy is self-serving. It breaches the principles of accountability and the public's right to know. Secrecy is almost always a conspiracy or self-delusion. The smart money always finds out. Compared to a policy of openness, the benefits of institutional secrecy are infinitesimal.

         â€”I am pleased to see the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice) in the chamber. Last week, under parliamentary privilege, he made a deplorable and cowardly attack on the President of the Queensland Local Government Association, Councillor Jim Pennell. His description of Councillor Pennell as a country bumpkin and a dill has naturally outraged local government people. This anger came to a head last Friday when the councils of the honourable member's own electorate censured him and condemned his repeated criticisms of local government leaders. The resolution of censure was carried without dissent at the Burnett Local Government Association conference and reflected growing dissatisfaction with his regular and insupportable allegations about even his own council.

         Apparently the honourable member is upset about the ongoing campaign by local government to have more of the Government's petrol excise rip-off allocated to roads. The facts are that the councils' pressure for more road funding has the overwhelming support of the community. To make such an unprovoked attack on a colleague in another tier of government who has no right of response not only reflects very poorly on the honourable member but also damages the reputation of the Parliament as a whole.

It is a king hit. It is a cowardly package. What it is meant to do is to shift money from the battlers to the yuppies at the top end of the market. Honourable members opposite have the audacity to come in here and stick up for special privilege. The National Party of Australia has been sold a lemon. The Leader of the National Party (Mr Tim Fischer) has been conned. Even their mate Sir Robert Sparkes, with whom I do not agree very often, said that National Party members will not be able to sell this package in the bush. They will not be able to, because they want to put a tax of 15 per cent on fruit and vegetables, meat, bread, milk and other dairy products. They have the hide to talk about compassion. They have the hide to talk about courage. It is not being very brave to tax working families and women and kids. That is what they want to do. Over the next 12 months we are going to ram this package right down their necks.

         â€”Today I want to draw the attention of the House to the road safety campaign that is being conducted in Victoria at present. I believe it should be adopted by all States. The message of the campaign is that motorists should wear their seat belts. Research indicates that, if everyone wore seat belts, Victoria's road toll would be cut by up to 10 per cent. Chief Superintendent Fox of the O district described people who did not wear seat belts as lazy. He said, `Not only that; they are just stupid. They are putting their own lives at risk'. I draw this to the attention of the House because yesterday the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) failed to wear his seat belt at the Toyota plant in Victoria.

Honourable members should have a look at the unemployment situation. If all the unemployed people stood a metre apart, the line would stretch further than from Melbourne to Sydney. Yet the Government wants to stand up and criticise what the Opposition is putting up as a decent and reasonable alternative to what it is doing.

          I am going to make this additional point just to ram home a very unpleasant reality for the Opposition: this is essentially an argumentâ€”a fairly arcane argument, I might sayâ€”about how one should adjust the tax scales to account for the effects of inflation or the effects of wage movements. On the one hand, the Opposition essentially is now sayingâ€”this was made perfectly clear a couple of nights ago when the Leader of the Opposition put out a press statement saying that the adjustment should have been on the basis of a 3.5 per cent movement in earnings rather than a movement in the CPIâ€”that if you want to maintain the position of a taxpayer at one point in time compared with another point in time, and if you are going to preserve the equality of that taxpayer's position, you should adjust the tax scales in the intervening period by the movements in earnings in that period, whereas the Treasury said, `No, that is not right. You should adjust the tax scales for movement in the CPI'.

          During yesterday's discussion, somebody asked me what practice has been followed in relation to this issue. I went back to a period when the taxation scales were indexed, and that was a period from July 1976. The Leader of the Opposition ought to remember this because he at the time was advising the then Treasurer, Sir Phillip Lynch. The then Fraser Government decided that it would index the tax scales from July 1976 in order to cope with this question of bracket creep, in other words, to index the tax scales.

         What did it use as its measure? What was its legislative measure? Did it legislate to adjust the tax scales for movements in earnings, or did it adjust the tax scales for movements in the CPI? What does Budget Paper No. 4 in that Budget say? It says the following:

        and other things. Then it goes on to say:

        These are to be automatically adjusted each year for increases which have occurred in the consumer price index.

        So this was the mechanism decided upon by the Fraser Government, decided by Sir Phillip Lynch as Treasurer and advised as he was by the now Leader of the Opposition. But now, of course, it becomes convenient for the Leader of the Opposition to say something entirely differentâ€”to say, `No, no, no, that was then; now we are going to do something else'.

         So all this stuff that the Deputy Leader of the Opposition is going on with about magic puddings full of money that can be handed back is just nonsense. It has nothing whatever to do with that. It is how one adjusts the tax scales to ensure that bracket creep is either not collected or is appropriately returned. This is just another demonstration of the fact that the Leader of the Opposition has totally flexible principles. He has no principles whatsoever. He just picks them up, he makes a collection of principles as he goes through life, in a way which happens to suit him at the time. He is totally politically capricious.

        In other words, we should take two million as being reasonable because the Opposition could have made it three million. Now we are down to the real nitty-gritty of the Fightback package: the thing is that the two million jobs claim was totally fraudulent, just a judgment off the top of your head; it had no basis in econometrics whatsoever.

         You are now about turning up the knobs on more change for Fightback mark II as Fightback mark I slips under the waves. How are you going to do that? Are you going to increase the Budget deficit? Are you going to claim that you can cut more than $10 billion out of government spending? Surely you are not going to claim that. Are you going to claim the Murphy inflation forecast of 6 per cent and 7 per cent without Fightback, or 10 per cent with Fightback, or are you going to claim the Government's growth figures and say that that allows you a few more billion, which you could use not to produce a surplus by 1995-96, but to produce basically another Box Hill tax grabâ€”another Box Hill tax bribeâ€”of the variety which the Liberal Party ran in 1987 and in 1990?

         The fact is we have paid more. The reason for that is we have cut the bottom rate from 30 per cent to 20 per cent. When I became Treasurer, the tax-free threshold was $4,900 and the bottom rate from $4,900 on was 30 per cent. That is now $5,400 and the bottom rate is 20 per cent. But I never heard any support from the Leader of the Opposition for that. I never heard any support for the family allowance supplement; I never heard any support for the national wage cases. Now you drag out those pathetic tax cuts of yours which do not even compensate for GST and you think you can ask a question with some sort of sincerity. You have got to be joking.

         â€”In response to the honourable member for Calwell, I can say that it has been a major element of the Government's industrial relations strategy in recent years to move to a system of enterprise, or workplace, bargaining as the principal means of wage determination. That has been pursued through the award restructuring approach, section 115, relating to certified agreements in the Industrial Relations Act and, more recently, the enterprise bargaining principle and the national wage principles which require any wage increase to be based on actual implementation of efficiency measures designed to effect real gains in productivity. So we now have in the system a principle which is driving enterprise bargains based on increased productivity.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         I am pleased to advise the House that this strategy is now bearing fruit. Although it is relatively early days since the implementation of that principle, there are over 40 enterprise agreements which have been ratified by the Industrial Relations Commission to this date. There are also a substantial number of agreements which have not come to the Commissionâ€”and they are probably not likely toâ€”which will remain as over award agreements.

         Quite clearly, the move to enterprise bargaining is on and it is likely to become very widespread in the next year or so. All of these agreements are designed to increase productivity and improve competitiveness. Perhaps none bears that out more so than the Toyota agreement, which covers 6,000 employees. Its objectives are linked to obtaining international best practice manufacturing standards, including things such as: achieving international quality levels; realising cost structures similar to those of other sister plants overseas; supplying product to the marketplace on a timely and cost-effective basis; and providing a rate of return on investment comparable to other Toyota operations.

         I am sure that everyone in the House would agree that those are worthwhile objectives. There is an array of productivity improvements to achieve that. We have all of this happening under the umbrella of the accord, with agreement about the overall wage outcome and with agreement that the inflation rate coming from all of this should be such as to keep us at a rate comparable to that of our major trading partners. As we have announced in One Nation, it is our intention to move shortly to amend the Industrial Relations Act to further facilitate the making of enterprise agreements.

         In contrast to all of thatâ€”which clearly shows that there is an effective strategy in place to develop enterprise bargainingâ€”we have from the Opposition a demand that there be a major industrial relations reform to bring on enterprise bargaining, as though nothing was happening; whereas in fact, as I have already shown, there is a major move in that direction and a very effective implementation of enterprise bargaining.

        Yet in the whole 656 pages of Fightback, guess how many pages were devoted to this central pointâ€”two. Of those two, one was devoted to expenditure cuts dismembering the Department of Industrial Relations and most of the programs. Only three-quarters of a page related to this most important area of policy. So I do not think the Opposition can really say that it regards this as so important if it gives so little time to it.

         The policy is incredibly confused and misleading. The Leader of the Opposition says that there will be three streams: a centralised stream, a certified agreement stream and a voluntary agreement stream. The Opposition spokesman says that there will be two streams: a centralised stream and a voluntary agreement stream. The Leader of the Opposition says that he will retain a centralised award system as one stream. But then he says that if he had his way there would be no wage increases ever of a centralised nature. What sort of a stream is that?

         It is also the case that this policy would be massively exploitative because it would provide that in the voluntary agreement area the only protection would be a guaranteed minimum wage and occupational health and safety standards. The shadow spokesman in this area, the honourable member for Bennelong, has admitted that that guaranteed minimum wage could be less than current award rates. He said in an interview with Laurie Oakes on the

        So there we areâ€”less than award rates. It is also a policy which allows employers to sack their work force and then re-hire it under a so-called voluntary agreement. Some voluntariness! This was put to the shadow Minister by Mr Oakes. He said:

        But let me put this to you. If I'm an employer, and I can sack the workforce and re-hire them on your minimum wage, why wouldn't I? I'd be mad.

        In other words, `You are damned right, Laurie'. This policy is massively deficient. It is also clearly inflationary, and especially in the context of the introduction of a GST. It is also very confrontationist, with talk about slashing the power of the unions, beefing up the Trade Practices Act and widening the scope for deregistration. This policy, the centrepiece of Fightback, is clearly a policy shambles. It is no wonder that the whole policy is a shambles when its centrepiece, its major point, is a complete disaster.

         â€”I thank the honourable member for his question. What the Treasury papers tabled the other day did reveal, to the acute embarrassment of the Opposition, is that the overwhelming majority of Australians do very badly indeed under the Opposition's proposals. It is fairly simple to understand why when we bear in mind that, as a result of the imposition of the new tax on food, clothing and a few other things, the revenue that is raised comes from each and every Australianâ€”man, woman and childâ€”to the tune, on average, of $23 a week.

         This is a massive money laundering system whereby $40 billion is moved from one point to another. What members of the Opposition have been trying to tell us through all the $40 billion smokescreen is that somehow every Australian will be better off. The reason they get to that is that they are basically obsessed by models. But most Australians are not that obsessed by models.

It is particularly noteworthy in that the first part of the year was clearly suffering a hangover from the Gulf war period. The latter part of the year showed very considerable growth rates, in a world context where the international tourism industry was flat.

        It is in the 1950s, as the Prime Minister has indicated, with a lot of its other policies. But let me give honourable members one example amongst many of how those opposite have made a fundamental political error in terms of their tourism package. The passage that I will quote is in the context of the Bureau of Tourism Research indicating that we will require at least an extra 90,000 rooms simply to accommodate conservative estimates of the likely increase of tourism to this country. But in terms of meeting that objective, which is what the One Nation package was in large measure about, let us compare one aspect of the Opposition's policy. Price Waterhouse, I would have thought, in these matters is something of an umpire.

What the Government did in its statement was to make a very substantial change to the cost of capital regime in this country. For things such as aluminium smelting with 20- and 30-year timeframe investments, 20 years will now be written off over 7 1/2 years and 40 years over 15 years. That means there is a dramatic acceleration in the cash flow, that is, the depreciable amounts, and therefore the cash flow of the business. Of course, with new projects or even additions to existing projects, so-called brown fields projects, the development allowance would provide a healthy new one increment to company cash flows in the event that such proposals are developed.

         The Liberal Party may take a dim view of One Nation because it takes a totally different view of the world from its view. One Nation tries to build Australia, expand Australia, give Australia competitive opportunities, which it will never get from the sterile accountancy of the Fightback proposals, now substantially discredited.

He would like to have some sort of public measurement of his standing before the general realisation that Fightback is finished seeps through to the populationâ€”by the time it seeps out of the newspapers and the television sets of this country that, basically, Fightback is internally inconsistent; that it cannot provide a package to business without a cost to households; that it cannot provide two million jobs and that that figure was only a judgment or a guesstimate; that its inflation forecast and growth forecast have nothing to do with the modelling of the package; that all of the assumptions are internally inconsistent; and that four out of five Australian taxpayers would be worse off and 70 per cent of Australian households would be worse off. As that seeps into the population, people will know that the Liberal Party has conned them with a fraudâ€”a deceptive proposal that basically was put hoping that no proper analysis would take place.

         Now the Government has put a proposal to the country which is about the kind of vista that Labor has always been about: building Australia; making it internationally competitive; breaking down the barriers in the micro-economy; improving rail, roads, ports and airlines; extending technical and further education; giving support to families; increasing the family allowance supplement. That is all of that nation building which Labor is good at, and it will pull Australia together as one nation, with workers, business and the Government going forward with low inflationary growth in the 1990s.

         You cannot stand it now that the Government and the Treasury have basically blown the case out of the water. You thought they would take the bookkeeping option, particularly when they did not understand what the bookkeeping was all about. You had a chance to answer it, and could not. Now what we will see are the new proposals: Fightback 2 and Fightback 3, or `Throwback 1' and Fightback 2. Then it will be `Throwback 2' and Fightback 3â€”and that will be about making the deficit larger; pretending that you can cut government expenditure by more than $10 billion; or just buying votes a la Box Hill 1987 or 1990.

         That is what we will see from the Leader of the Opposition. The Liberals took him on board as Leader and gave him his go. He has handcuffed them to the black box of Fightback, which has now blown to bits. There will be great gnashing of teeth over there as Opposition members wonder what their fate is. I can tell you, Mr Speakerâ€”and I will conclude on this happy noteâ€”that it is not going to be much.

At the commencement of Question Time I thought that I might have to raise this as a matter of privilege, but in deference to your position I thought it might be more appropriate if I asked it as a question of you.

         â€”Nine years ago today this Government came to office promising jobs, jobs, jobs. It now presides over an economy in which over one million Australians cannot find the jobs that they want and in which the unemployment of young people is becoming a matter of the gravest national concern. We are witnessing the demoralisation of a generation of young people; the creation of a new under-class in this country comprising young people who neither can find work nor, under this Government, are likely to have any prospect of finding work. On the most recent figures, 34.8 per cent of the young people of this country under 19 looking for full time work are unemployed. Over 40 per cent are either unemployed or underemployed. What that means is that 320,000 young Australians cannot find the work that they want.

         The worst unemployment, not surprisingly, has been in the Labor-governed states of Victoria, Tasmania and Queensland. In regions such as south-west Victoria, Mackay-Fitzroy and North Adelaide, unemployment rates amongst young people are approaching 50 per cent or more. Even these sorts of rates massively understate the real disaster which Labor has visited on Australia's young people.

         During 1991 some 91,500 full time youth jobs simply disappeared. Over 80,000 young people who would have filled these jobs have disappeared completely from the unemployment rolls. Many of these have simply gone back to school, where their unemployment is hidden from public view. Many of these, unfortunately, are unwillingly in the classroom, and this affects the standard of behaviour in classrooms and makes the tasks of the already grossly overburdened teachers even more difficult.

         In January this year there were 630,000 families with one or more members unemployed. Of these some 227,000 had unemployed offspringâ€”young dependent members of the family. When family members are seeking work and cannot find it, families are placed under enormous stress. Indeed, family breakdown becomes more likely and young people are more inclined to leave home. The fruitless search for jobs eats away at the self-respect of this country's young people, and the collapse of self-respect in turn makes it increasingly difficult to take effective action. Over 90,000 young Australians under the age of 24 have been out of work for a year or more. Many have simply stopped looking.

         In some cases the loss of self-respect becomes self-destructive. The rise in youth suicide is, regrettably, attributed by researchers in this area in significant part to the rise in youth unemployment, and I regret to say that the area of Australia most neglected by this Governmentâ€”rural Australiaâ€”shows this problem in its starkest extent. Whereas the male suicide rate amongst young people in Sydney has remained relatively stable over the last 25 years, this rate has more than doubled in rural cities, and increased more than fivefold in rural shires and smaller towns. The rate of suicide has increased most in the past five years. Professor Brent Waters and Dr Michael Dudley of the Child and Adolescent Psychiatry Unit at Sydney's Prince of Wales Children's Hospital attribute this to a loss of identity and the economic crisis in rural Australia. They identify youth unemployment as very likely to be a major factor.

The fact is that the youth participation rate in the work force at 59.8 per cent is not far below the participation rate for the total population.

Aggregated over three years, we are looking at an additional commitment of $720m into the TAFE system compared to the Opposition's measly $215m. In practical terms, that translates into a difference of 100,000 TAFE places less under those opposite as compared with what will be provided by us.

         I make a couple of comments on the unemployment statistics because they are important. A huge amount of distortion goes on here. We see Opposition spokespersons putting out statements saying that one in three young people are unemployed. Senator Baume, in particular, likes to do this. The reality is that, due to a revolution in participation in education and training over the last 10 years which has been absolutely profound, we have seen a doubling of school retention rates and a huge growth in higher education. There has been insufficient growth in the TAFE sector, admittedly, but that has been a State responsibility up to now. We are now trying to negotiate with the States to massively build that sector. But there has been a participation revolution so that now 66 per cent of young people in the 15 and 19 years age group are in some form of education or training.

         Consequently, in terms of unemployment, the 30 per cent which is quoted is the number of young people unemployed as a percentage of those actually in the labour force, but the majority of them are not in the labour force. Looking at the population group in seasonally adjusted terms, according to the latest Australian Bureau of Statistics figures 8.8 per cent of people in the 15 to 19 years age group are unemployed and seeking full time work. That compares with a figure of 12.4 per cent when those opposite were in government. There are now 40,000 fewer young people unemployed and seeking full time work than was the case when the lot opposite were in power. That puts that figure into perspective.

We are underpinning and supporting that with a huge injection of new funds for the TAFE system over the next three years. We will continue to build the higher education system with further growth, with an emphasis on getting the funding rate per student up and having a proper quality assurance structure.

We can determine this with accuracy by looking at the latest Graduate Careers Council of Australia annual survey of graduate career destinations. The Careers Council survey studies career movements of those graduates who finished their courses in 1989 and 1990 and came on the market in 1990 and 1991. The survey confirms that the recession is not just biting the unskilled and so forth; it is eating into the stock of young graduates emerging as the new core of the labour force who have not previously been employed.

The Opposition would ration the current rate of access according to ability to pay. In reality that would be in important but relatively expensive areas such as engineering, science and agriculture, some of the areas the honourable member for Gippsland was so concerned about. This Government will create a new high status, better resourced vocational training sector.

         â€”The Finance Minute on report 310, the business migration program, provides coordinated departmental responses to a number of recommendations made by the Joint Committee of Public Accounts in its report on the business migration program. These responses, being from the Department of Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Australian Federal Police and the Australian Taxation Office, are separate to those responses to policy recommendations that have already been made by the Minister for Immigration, Local Government and Ethnic Affairs, the honourable member for Melbourne (Mr Hand).

         The Committee report 310 on the business migration program recommended that the accredited agents scheme be abolished, that the business migration program be replaced with a new category of entry targeted towards migrants with business and entrepreneurial skills, based on a points system with concessions for age and English language skills. The Government accepted all these recommendations from the Committee.

         It is gratifying to note the alacrity with which the Minister has moved to implement the major recommendations of the Committee, although this no doubt says something about the nature of the problems identified by the Public Accounts Committee. The Minister announced the winding up of the business migration program by accepting the key recommendations of the Committee on 25 July 1991, only five weeks after the report was tabled on 21 June 1991.

         This action was followed by an announcement from the Minister of the acceptance of the recommendations concerning the replacement category of entry for migrants with business skills on 17 December last. This new category of entry will, as recommended by the Committee, be based on a points system and recognise the business and entrepreneurial skills and background of the migrant. It will also seek to ensure that these skills are maximised for the benefit of Australia by establishing baseline criteria for all applicants, which include: an overall successful business career; a genuine and realistic commitment to engaging in business in Australia; registration with a business advisory agency in the State or Territory of intended residence; and signing a declaration acknowledging the Australian Government's requirements in relation to his or her entry into this country as a business migrant.

         The Minister has also taken measures, in line with the Committee's recommendations, to toughen the standards for business migrants. These include the provision of ministerial discretion, via legislative amendment to the Migration Act, to cancel the status of business skills migrants if they have not made a genuine effort to meet the objectives of the category within the first three years of their arrival. At the same time, the Minister has initiated a mandatory comprehensive monitoring system for business migrants, with financial penalties for those who default. The business skills category of migration has been in operation since February this year, which means that the Minister has taken only seven months to implement the recommendations of the Committee from the time the report was tabled.

         The sorry tale of the administration identified in the Committee's report of the business migration program is one that signals to the Parliament the importance of the scrutiny work undertaken by a great many of the committees of both Houses. We believe that in conducting this inquiry the Public Accounts Committee has proven again that its effectiveness as a watchdog on behalf the Parliament and the taxpayers of Australia in identifying, investigating and rectifying instances of maladministration in government departments remains paramount.

The operation of Australia's offsets program has been a matter of concern to the Committee since 1987â€”quite some time before I became the Chairman of the Public Accounts Committeeâ€”and it continues to present problems to the Committee. For the moment I only wish to say that it will be the subject of further discussion by the Public Accounts Committee. I commend both of these finance minutes to the House.

        I take great pleasure in introducing the National Rail Corporation Agreement Bill 1991. The purpose of the Bill is to allow the Commonwealth to approve the shareholders' agreement relating to the establishment of the National Rail Corporation. The Bill represents another major step in the implementation of the Government's micro-economic reform program which is directed at creating a more productive, efficient and flexible economy.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The Bill involves significant restructuring: in this case, of rail institutions, technology, management and work practices. Without such initiatives we will be unable to meet the community's current needs, let alone our future needs. It is an important transport reform. Transport affects almost every area of Australian economic and social activity. As a significant intermediate cost, efficient transport is vital to the competitiveness of the Australian economy. Even small improvements in the efficiency of our transport system offer potentially large economic and social gains. This is highlighted by a number of major studies in recent years, which have exposed the deficiencies in our transport system and the potential gains from reform.

         In 1989-90, the Industry Commission estimated that a more efficient land transport system, including a more efficient rail system, alone could realise an additional $6 billion in gross domestic product every year. Of this, $4.4 billion was attributable to rail. More recently, in its October 1991 report on rail transport, the Industry Commission confirmed the importance of reforming the rail industry. Australia cannot afford to ignore such gains, particularly given their potential for contributing to economic growth and our standard of living.

         One of the major problems in the rail industry is the inability of the existing systems to obtain their proper share of interstate freight, particularly on the eastern seaboard.

        This is due in the main to the quality of the service that rail delivers. Terminals are inadequate, work and management practices need improvement, and reliability needs to be greatly improved. It is widely acknowledged that much of the problem lies in the fragmented management of rail. That said, the position is not irredeemable. Industry has said that it would make greater use of rail if a reliable, quality service were provided. Indeed, rail can confidently be said to have a bright future, provided it can be operated efficiently.

         There are some types of traffic where rail beats the competition hands down. The most obvious example of this is the carriage of freight over medium to long distances. If rail undertakes the tasks to which it is best suited, and is efficient, it can carry goods at a lower cost to the community than road transport. And there will be savings in terms of accidents, air and noise pollution and energy costs.

         Accordingly, the Federal Government has positively promoted the revitalisation of the interstate rail freight system. This is part of a broader set of transport industry initiatives and objectives within which each of the transport modes can undertake the tasks to which it is best suited. It is not a matter of favouring one mode over another. What the Government is striving for is an integrated transport system that will provide the community with an efficient and competitive land transport system.

         That rail can be a success in Australia has been clearly demonstrated by the Commonwealth's own railway, the Australian National Railways Commission. AN has long practised the commercial approach that will be taken by the National Rail Corporation, and its success is clear for all to see. The Industry Commission acknowledged this achievement in its recent rail report. I would like to take this opportunity to congratulate AN, its employees and management for the effort they have put in since its creation in 1978. I expect that the skills and expertise built up by AN will prove to be a valuable asset for the National Rail Corporation.

         It is expected that the cash equity injections of $415m provided for by the agreement, together with commercial borrowings by the NRC, will lead to the speedy elimination of interstate rail deficits. The NRC is expected to break even within three years and become totally self-supporting after five. The meeting of this target will, in itself, be a major achievement. Interstate rail freight deficits are currently around $375m a year.

        The purpose of the Bill is to set in place the final stage of the legislative framework to meet obligations under the United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances, so that Australia can proceed with ratification of the Convention.

         When the Crimes (Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances) Bill was introduced in 1990 it was then said that it represented the first step in the process of Australia's ratification of the Convention. Ratification of this Convention is in accordance with the Government's ongoing commitment to the international fight against illicit drug traffic and abuse.

         The Convention seeks to ensure that the international community cooperates in the adoption of a wide range of measures aimed at stemming the illicit drug trade. It was said in August 1990 that ratification of this Convention will achieve one of the aims of the National Campaign Against Drug Abuse, which has the support of all governments in Australia. The States and Territories have been aware of the proposed Convention and the Commonwealth's wish to become a party to it from the beginning of the drafting process in 1985, and their views were sought at each stage of the negotiation process.

         Since that time the Government has continued with a process of consultation and negotiation with all of the States and Territories to identify areas of the Convention which can be given effect to by State and Territory legislation. The purpose of this consultation was to preserve the existing balance of responsibilities between the States and Commonwealth in the drugs area. The Government has been, as was said in the second reading speech in August 1990, very much aware of the importance of not encroaching on areas of State jurisdiction in this field, and fully supports the continuation of the cooperative approach to drug law enforcement with the State and Territory governments and their law enforcement agencies.

         In particular, the Government has sought State and Territory cooperation in enacting legislation to meet the mandatory obligations which the Convention imposes on parties. This includes legislation relating to money laundering where the money or property has been derived from a drug trafficking offence against State or Territory law. Unfortunately, there have been delays in some of the States and Territories, and some legislation is still to be enacted.

         The amendments give effect to particular obligations created by the convention. These are obligations with respect to criminalising money laundering, and confiscating the proceeds of drug offences. The legislation relies on the external affairs power and therefore follows the terminology of the Convention where appropriate.

         First, the Bill provides a shorthand description of various forms of conduct which are called `dealing in drugs'. The conduct identified as `dealing in drugs' reflects the activities required to be prohibited under the convention. Most of those activities are already subject to criminal sanction under existing State and Territory laws. In this Bill the expression `dealing in drugs' does not create offences.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Secondly, the Bill defines an offence called `a State drug offence'. This is conduct which is both a drug trafficking offence in the terms of the convention and a serious offence under the law of a State or Territory punishable by at least 12 months imprisonment. Use of the phrases `dealing in drugs' and `serious State drug offences' is merely a way of simplifying the reference to these activities in the later provisions of the Bill.

         Thirdly, the Bill creates the required offences of laundering money or other property that is known to have been derived from a `serious State drug offence'. These offences are described in much the same terms as those used in the Convention.

         Finally, the Bill makes provision for regulations to prescribe States and Territories to which the legislation will not apply. This means that the operation of the offence provisions in the Bill will be limited to those States and Territories which have not legislated to create offences of money laundering. Once these States and Territories have enacted conforming legislation, the regulations will be amended so that the legislation does not apply to them.

         It is intended that these Commonwealth offences will, in the event of a conviction, attract the confiscation provisions of the Proceeds of Crime Act 1987 with respect to `tainted property'.

         In applying these new Commonwealth money laundering offences, it will not matter that the conduct which is the `dealing in drugs' offence, for example manufacturing drugs, occurred in one State or Territory, and the money laundering conduct, for example the transfer of property, occurred in another State or Territory. Also, it will be possible that confiscation of proceeds action might be taken against property in a third State or Territory. Even where the State or Territory law is adequate to meet the obligations imposed by the Convention if all of the relevant conduct had occurred there, it may not cover conduct that crosses State or Territory borders.

        This Bill will replace the Service and Execution of Process Act 1901. That Act was one of the earliest enactments of this Parliament, in fact, Act No. 11 of 1901. That shows the importance accorded to provision for interstate service and execution of process on the creation of the Commonwealth. The Bill largely implements recommendations of the Law Reform Commission in its report on service and execution of process.

        The reference to the Law Reform Commission which led to its report was given by the Hon. Neil Brown, QC, on behalf of the Attorney-General in 1982. The reference resulted both from concern that the Act was in need of reform, and from suggestions from several State Attorneys-General that the Act should be extended to the process and decisions of tribunals.

         In its report the Law Reform Commission found that, while the Act had remained largely unchanged, changes in Australian society since 1901 have been dramatic. Business outlook is increasingly national and, for many purposes, State and Territory boundaries have become artificial and even meaningless. Reflecting these findings, the Commission recommended a major updating of the procedures in the Act, and their extension to the process and decisions of tribunals. The Act is, of course, concerned with the effective operation of State and Territory process and so of State and Territory bodiesâ€”the courts, police and correctional authorities.

         Accordingly, since the Law Reform Commission's report was tabled in December 1987, the Government has carried out an extensive and detailed program of consultation with the States and Territories about the Law Reform Commission's recommendations and about proposals to improve on those recommendations. The Government has been particularly concerned to focus on the practical application of its recommendations for State and Territory courts and agencies. We are grateful for the helpful comments and suggestions provided by State and Territory law departments, police forces, correctional authorities and tribunals.

If no `consent' is given a warrant can be issued and a magistrate will decide whether the person should go interstate on bail or in custody.

         Honourable members will recall that the Law Reform Commission's recommendation for procedures to enable the interstate service of subpoenas issued by investigative tribunals was implemented last year by the Service and Execution of Process Amendment Act 1991. Under the Bill initiating process issued by a tribunal performing an adjudicative function of the kind specified in the Bill can be served interstate. This includes a tribunal performing a disciplinary function, for example, a tribunal determining whether a person is a fit and proper person to carry on a particular profession.

         The requirement for interstate warrants to be endorsed by a judicial officer of the State of apprehension is abolished. The Bill also enables copies of warrants, including fax copies, to be acted upon. This removes the need for the issue of a provisional warrant while the original warrant is being sent interstate. The Bill substantially reproduces Part IVA of the Act which provides for the interstate enforcement of lower court fines. Part IVA was inserted in 1963, has been subsequently amended, and was excluded from the reference to the Law Reform Commission. Minor changes have been made to ensure consistency with the rest of the Bill.

         â€”The Sales Tax Laws Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1992 is a measure to reduce the wholesale sales tax on passenger motor vehicles from 20 per cent to 15 per cent and is part of the package of measures the Government brought forward in its so-called `One Nation, One Job' statement, which was revealed to the Australian public last week. It is interesting that this particular issue has not generated a great deal of interest amongst speakers on the Government side of the House. Indeed, the Australian Labor Party has only had one speaker in this debate, other than the Minister Assisting the Treasurer (Mr Baldwin), who introduced the Bill, and no-one else in the Labor Party seems in the slightest interested in discussing it.

         That is because the Labor Party, since the `One Nation, One Job' package announced last Wednesday night, has actually not been interested in talking about the package at all. Indeed, in the eight days that have elapsed since the introduction of that package, I do not think more than 10 or 15 minutes of the Parliament's time has been taken up by Labor members proclaiming, as they would see it, the great merits of their package.

         It is quite interesting that since the introduction of this statement, which the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) described as the most important economic statement made in the history of Australia, Labor members have spent practically no time talking about it, and instead have spent nearly all their time talking about the Opposition and the Opposition's policies, and producing all kinds of spurious and amazing claims about how, if the Opposition is elected to government, we will all be washed away by tidal waves and the sky will come crashing down and kill those few people who are left.

         To get back to this Bill, it is, as I said, a Bill that reduces the tax on passenger motor vehicles. I notice that this has led to some comparisons between the sales tax treatment of motor vehicles under the Labor Party, compared with the tax treatment of motor vehicles under the coalition's goods and services tax proposal. One of the claims that the Labor Party members love to make is that under the coalition's goods and services tax, expensive cars such as Ferraris and Maseratis will be cheaper.

         Labor members love to use Ferraris as an example, not wishing to be reminded of the current Prime Minister's E-type Jaguar that he once owned and the fact that he was an enthusiastic member of the Antique Cars Society, or something, in New South Wales some years ago; a reference in
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Who's Who

         that he has had struck from its pages in recent editions. Interesting! The serious point I am making is that they love to claim that we would reduce the price of expensive cars, and they feel that they are onto a better argument now that they have actually reduced, or are proposing to reduce, the wholesale sales tax on passenger motor vehicles.

         Let me say in response to that argument that it is worth remembering that during 1991, and during the current Prime Minister's term as Treasurer, the Government reduced the luxury car taxâ€”that is, the tax on cars which were valued above about $44,000â€”from 50 to 30 per cent, and in doing that, reduced the price of a new Ferrari series 348 by $30,000, which is the equivalent of average weekly earnings. It is interesting to reflect on the quality of the Government's argument that the coalition will bring down the price of Ferraris in its goods and services tax package, when it brought down the price of Ferraris last year by $30,000.

         I think a slightly more mature level of debate is required from the Government, and if it wants to get into those sorts of slanging matches about those sorts of issues, I say to it, `Be careful, because there may be some quite scary skeletons sitting in your cupboard, and we are the first people, you can rest assured, to rush around and open those cupboard doors'. I have actually been doing that during the day and in the context of this Bill. As my speech progresses I shall, one by one, open a number of cupboard doors and pull out the skeletons left there by the current Prime Minister in the context of the goods and services tax.

         On this Bill let me make this point: it is clearly nothing short of a political stunt. It is actually not an attempt by the Government to improve the taxation system in relation to the motor vehicle industry. If it were, first of all it would ensure that where purchases of motor vehicles were made as business inputs, the tax paid would be fully refundable, so that we would not have the effect of sales tax cascading through into prices, thereby increasing prices, not only to consumers but also of our exports.

         Indeed, the sales tax on cars, in one way or anotherâ€”be it a tax on cars of company sales representatives or on company cars used for other purposesâ€”is all passed on in the form of higher prices in the goods sold by individual firms or, indeed, the services sold by those firms, and they flow through into export prices, where exports are relevant.

         If the Government were serious, that is the sort of change it would have madeâ€”but it is not. The Government has not done that. If the Government were serious it would do another thing: it would not only reduce the tax on passenger motor vehiclesâ€”voters' taxes, I supposeâ€”it would reduce the tax on commercial vehicles as well. The interesting thing about this legislationâ€”this demonstrates the complete irrationality of the legislationâ€”is that the sales tax remains as it was on vehicles that are used by businesses, such as utilities, vans, four-wheel drive vehicles and so on, in an endeavour to earn income. In the worst recession in 60 years the Government retains that tax, which is ultimately passed on to consumers or in higher export prices, or both. However, the Government reduced the sales tax for voters by five percentage points.

         I do not think the public will fall for that. I think it is so manifestly a stunt. It is too manifestly a stunt. I am sure the advice of Government departments was to do something that was rational. We might reflect on the fact that one of the prouder boasts of the current Prime Minister when he was Treasurer was that he rationalised the wholesale sales tax system so that there were only three different rates of wholesale sales tax, or four if we count zero as a rateâ€”10 per cent, 20 per cent and 30 per cent. This was a boast of the present Prime Minister when he was the Treasurer not long ago.

         This Bill introduces a fourth rate, so that we now have 10 per cent, 15 per cent, 20 per cent and 30 per cent.

         The amendment moved by the honourable member for Curtin (Mr Rocher) really brings us to a broader debate about whether a wholesale sales tax regime is an effective regime to have. Would it not be better to have a goods and services tax as do 59 countries such as Indonesia, Taiwan, Germany and Japan and many South American countries; indeed, certainly every continent, and most countries of most continents? Having gone through a cupboard in which I found some skeletons, the material I found states:

Mr Deputy Speaker, you and the Parliamentary Secretary to the Attorney-General (Mr Duncan), who is at the table, could be excused for thinking that the demolition job on the existing wholesale sales tax was done by none other than the present Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Wentworth (Dr Hewson); the Deputy Leader of the Opposition, the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith); or another member of the coalition. But no, all those words were the words of the present Prime Minister back in 1985 when he absolutely demolished the existing wholesale sales tax in very fluent speeches and in very fluent arguments.

         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         </emphasis>
         not long after, decided that the great hope for the Labor Party was to go out and campaign against the tax and pretend that if it was introduced everybody would be plunged into dire povertyâ€”that ordinary Australians' living standards would fall way below the living standards of people in southern India, or somewhere such as that. Of course, people are not going to believe that. They will believe it even less when they are continually reminded what the honourable member for Blaxland, the Prime Minister, thought when he was the Treasurer and which, no doubt, he secretly believes to this very day.

         One of the arguments we get from the Labor Party now is that the goods and services taxâ€”I have alluded to this in the context of the Ferraris and so onâ€”will reduce the price of luxuries. Remember this? On 9 June 1985 the present Prime Minister said:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Most of the things in the 30 per cent schedule are today everyday items, such as TV sets, video tape recorders, biros, these sorts of things. And there are very few which are luxuries. . . I mean, I just don't think we ought to skew the whole tax system around to worry about a couple of items like that.
       </para>
       <para>
        He also said that people believed that if a goods and services tax were introduced and personal income taxes were reduced that would somehow be a slug on the poor. However, the honourable member for Blaxland, when he was Treasurer, not the Prime Minister as he is nowâ€”unbelievablyâ€”said:
       </para>

         The arguments that the Prime Minister used to use just go on and on. The argument about how a goods and services tax would be inflationary is an argument that he passionately argued against. I do not have time now to read out the quotes, but he passionately argued against it when he was Treasurer. He utterly rejected the arguments and, no doubt, regarded people who put that proposition forward as scumbags, scum and all the sorts of things he likes to call people. Now he is arguing that the goods and services tax is somehow massively inflationary and that it is going to have a terrible effect on this country.

         A recent International Monetary Fund survey of 35 countries which had introduced goods and services taxes showed that in 29 cases there was no effect on the underlying inflation rateâ€”only a shift increase in the price level at the time of introduction. In the six countries where there was a change in the underlying rate of inflation, to quote the IMF, `this was associated in each case with expansionary wage and credit policies'. In three of those six cases, the introduction of the goods and services tax was associated with an increase in the overall tax burden. In other words, it was not offset with personal income taxes.

In any case, the wholesale sales tax, the fuel excise and the payroll tax all impinge on the purchases of so-called necessities.

The Labor Party, with its one million unemployed hanging round its neck, loves to argue that it cares about the poor and that what it does is equitable. The 1988-89 household expenditure survey showed that, in relative terms, the wholesale sales tax burden on grocery items bought by the lowest 20 per cent of income earnersâ€”the poorest one-fifth of Australiansâ€”is three times as high as for the top 20 per cent. Those low income earners pay 1.38 per cent of their income in wholesale sales tax, while the top 20 per cent of income earners pay only 0.44 per cent. What is so equitable about that?  Where is the equity in the current wholesale sales tax system?

         â€”I am pleased to follow the honourable member for Mayo (Mr Downer). This Sales Tax Laws Amendment Bill (No. 1) 1992 gives effect to the Government's announcement in One Nation to reduce the rate of sales tax on a limited range of cars from 20 per cent down to 15 per cent. I take it that the Government, in selling its One Nation package, is relying almost totally on the filibuster that we have put up with and the tirade of abuse that we were subjected to during Question Time by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), the Treasurer (Mr Dawkins) and one or two others.

         We are debating an important proposition and I wonder why there are not more members of the Government here in the chamber or prepared to debate us on this issue. Unless I read the speakers list incorrectly, there are no Government speakers involved in this debate at this time. Yet this is an important matter. As the honourable member for Mayo has said at some length, the whole question of the wholesale sales taxâ€”not only this particular change to the law which is being proposed by the Government, but the whole range of issues related to wholesale sales taxâ€”is absolutely fundamental to an understanding of what the Opposition proposes in its Fightback package.

         Our proposition is very simple:  rather than fiddle around with wholesale sales tax, which the Government has been doing for years and attempts to do once again in this legislation, we will abolish all wholesale sales tax. That is our solution to the ramshackle range of wholesale sales taxes that we are subjected to at present. This particular legislation picks up on the proposition that the Prime Minister put to us in his One Nation statement in respect of family cars. As I think the Prime Minister pointed out, this will result in a price reduction of a little over 3 per cent, or about $800, on the average sedan. To the extent that that happens, the Opposition does not oppose this legislation.

         Much has already been said about the One Nation package and I am quite sure that the debate on it will go on from now until the next election. In legislation that was debated yesterday we were talking about how the Government proposes to hand out tax cuts to rich people at the expense of the poor. When we look at this particular measureâ€”perhaps a little critically notwithstanding our intention to support this legislationâ€”we must also wonder about the rationale for it. The Prime Minister said in his statement:

         To stimulate the demand for passenger motor vehicles (other than luxury vehicles), the rate of wholesale sales tax applying to sub-luxury passenger motor vehicles will be reduced from the present general rate of 20 per cent to a new rate of 15 per cent.

        I found this statementâ€”as did, apparently, a number of constituents who were in the process of buying carsâ€”rather misleading. In other words, it did not at that time define what sorts of motor vehicles the Prime Minister was actually talking about.

         For instance, I had one constituent who was negotiating at the time to buy a Toyota Four-Runner SR5 Limited, which is a small four-wheel drive sedan. After hearing what the Prime Minister had to say, this constituent relied on that information in his negotiations to purchase that particular vehicle. Of course, he has subsequently found outâ€”having done the dealâ€”that that particular vehicle is not subject to the sales tax reduction. When we did look at what the Prime Minister actually proposed, we found that the sales tax reduction from 20 per cent to 15 per cent applied only to a fairly limited range of vehicles.

         In the second reading speech the Minister said that this reduction in sales tax will help stimulate the demand for those particular vehicles. We are speaking in general terms about family sedansâ€”Commodores, Falcons and so on. I would question whether that will happen. I have talked with some of the dealers in my electorate and asked them whether there has been a rush to buy those particular cars. The answer is no. I was quite disappointed to hear that, because that is the rationale for this legislationâ€”at a cost to revenue, I think the Prime Minister acknowledges, of approximately $40m in 1991-92 and $185m in 1992-93. That is a fair bit of revenue forgone, particularly if the idea does not work. But I suppose that if it does not work, it will not cost any money.

         Theoretically, the reduction in price ought to stimulate demand, but the plan makes a couple of assumptions which I do not believe are tenable. Firstly, it assumes that people have the money now to rush out to buy a new car. We all know, of course, that there are not many people at the moment who are able to do that. People have been so badly affected by this recession that I do not think this reduction of $800 in the price of a car, assuming it is passed onâ€”and I will come to that in a momentâ€”will assist people to rush out to buy a new car. Secondly, the proposition assumes that people are confident enough about the future to want to buy a new car. After talking with a number of my constituents, I believe that buying a car is the furthest thing from their minds.

         On simple economics, if one wants to talk about price elasticityâ€”and we do not want to get too theoretical hereâ€”the reduction in price, to the extent that it occurs, will have a very limited effect on the demand for these particular cars. In that sense it merely becomes yet another cheap little electoral bribe. The whole range of issues outlined in One Nation have been illustrated by us, I believe with some effect, to be really just an attempt to buy votes. Of course, we have the prospect of the Wills by-election, the date of which was announced today. That will be the Government's first priority.

         I would challenge any honourable member to refute that dealers have been just about willing to give cars away in recent times. My local dealers have been trying just about everything to sell cars. They have cut their profit margins to the bone; they have offered to give just about every conceivable extra to convince people to buy a new car. There has never been a better time to buy a new car if one is interested in doing so.

         Sales of new cars have declined so markedly in recent times because of the economic downturn, as the Prime Minister acknowledges in his speech. He said that the sales of passenger motor vehicles had suffered heavily in the economic downturn. They will continue to do so, of course. People needing or wanting to buy a new car would have done so by now because they could have done a really good deal. Of course, they will not do so now. I do not believe that $800 will have a great effect at all.

         We also need to question whether the $800 will be passed on to the public. The Prime Minister made the point in his speech that the Government expects this cut in tax to be passed on in full to car buyers. That is some expectation! Dealers' profit margins have been cut to the bare bone; they are hardly making any profit at all on the sale of new motor vehicles. I would not blame them for one minute if they quite reasonably took the opportunity to get a little bit of profit. As I have already pointed out, they will have difficulty selling motor vehicles in the future, just as they have had difficulty doing so in the recent past.

         The Prime Minister said that he expects the reduction will be passed on. It is a bit like his statement in respect of speeding up the construction of Brisbane Airport. He said he will urge the Federal Airports Corporation to speed that up. So far his urging has fallen on fairly deaf ears, I can assure him, so I am not sure what he means by `urge' or `expects'. In any case I do not know whether he was aware when he made his statement that retail prices on these cars are set to increase in the next few weeks, so those increases will virtually absorb the impact or effect of the $800 reduction in wholesale sales tax.

         The truth is that, in this economic climate that the Government has created, sales tax could be lifted completely, it could be wiped from 20 per cent to zero, and it still would hardly stimulate demand. If the Prime Minister had gone that far and said, `I am wiping sales tax on new motor vehicles',  I doubt whether even that would have caused people to rush out to their Holden or Ford or Nissan dealer to buy a new car the next day. That is the economics of the matter.

         The other response of the Government has been through handouts, poorly targeted, with the prospect of creating 800 jobs. I can assure the Prime Minister there will be very few of those jobs in the motor vehicle industry as a result of this particular proposition. In fact, the motor vehicle industry has been scaling down employment for years. The irony is that when we look at this attempt to create jobs in the motor vehicle industry, and look at that industry alone, we find that it stands as an incredible indictment of every aspect of Labor Party policy. The motor vehicle industry, which this Bill is designed to assist, has been heavily protected for 40 years. Behind that wall of protection trade unions have introduced work practices which have led to appallingly low productivity.

         The result is, interestinglyâ€”and, as I say,  almost ironically when we are talking about legislation to reduce the price of carsâ€”that cars in Australia are far too expensive. They have always been too expensive. The average motor vehicle in Australia is thousands of dollars more expensive than it ought to be. Is it not interesting that in the One Nation statement, where the Government talks about restructuring and so on, we find an attempt to bring down the price of motor vehicles? Yet we need only to look at that industry to find an indictment of Australian work practices and productivity levels.

         I believe that only the Opposition will act to make Australian industry competitive. Under our goods and services tax proposal, all carsâ€”not just a limited rangeâ€”will be made more affordable. The important point that the Prime Minister does not want to talk aboutâ€”and neither did the Treasurer in Question Time todayâ€”is that cars purchased for business purposes will be tax free. At the moment, even when people buy a Falcon or Commodore at the reduced rates, they pay wholesale sales tax at the rate of 15 per cent. Under the goods and services tax, the GST that applies on the purchase of a motor vehicle used for business purposes will be completely rebated. If that term is too technical, let me say that it simply means that there will be no sales tax on motor vehicles purchased for business use. I think that is a significant advantage for business.

I am glad the Treasurer was never a schoolteacher, if that is the way he learned to put his case, because I do not think anyone understands him in here, let alone in the community. If we were to have an honest debate about the effect of the GST we would see in terms of motor vehicles alone significant advantages for business in that it will not have to pay any sales tax at all. Any goods and service tax that applies to the sale of new motor vehicles will be fully rebated, effectively meaning that there will be no taxes on the sale of new motor vehicles.

         The wholesale sales tax, as we understand it, is beyond fixing. We have described it as a hidden tax, which it is. People do not know how much they are paying. On motor vehicles alone, counting the zero rate that applies, people are paying some five different rates of wholesale sales tax. Different rates of sales tax apply to a whole range of goods. People do not know how much they are paying. Here again is a real benefit of the goods and services tax system. People will know what they are paying. They will know what the Government is taking from them at the time they purchase a particular item. At the moment they do not. The average person one speaks to in the street has no idea what the sales tax is on a television set or on numerous items on the supermarket shelves.

It has made a half-hearted attempt to reduce the burden on a small section of the community.

         â€”None whatsoever. Families living in rural Australia who were watching the Prime Minister on televisionâ€”that is, if they could get a clear picture that nightâ€”thought that they might be able to trade in their family vehicle on a brand new one and save something in the vicinity of $800, the Prime Minister's suggested figure. But no, wait for it: their family vehicle is a four-wheel drive  and therefore not classified as a new family car. It is no cheaper today than it was last Thursday.

         Some honourable members may suggest that it is the family's choice to purchase a four-wheel drive and that they should revise their decision and purchase a nice comfortable family sedan. Chances are they would love to, but chances are they cannot, will not and do not. Many rural families purchase four-wheel drive vehicles out of necessity owing to the appalling road conditions which are a direct legacy of this Government's neglect of the road systems in Australia. This is a reflection on the manner in which the Government has treated the motorist, as well as the fuel tax arrangements that have been used as a milch cow for propping up other parts of Australia. These families will receive no relief from the temporary Prime Minister's economic statement. The open letter from the honourable member for Kalgoorlie (Mr Campbell) to the Prime Minister confirms that he is a temporary Prime Minister.

         This Government has been totally preoccupied with the golden triangleâ€”Melbourne, Sydney and Canberraâ€”and the better cities program, and has neglected the wealth generating rural areas of Australia. The 20 per cent sales tax rate will still apply to all motor vehicles except those specifically identified as passenger motor vehicles. Passenger motor vehicles have a very narrow definition and do not include those commercial and four-wheel drive vehicles I spoke of earlier. Clearly, we have an iniquitous regime where some vehicles have attracted the 20 per cent sales tax and will now become cheaper, while others remain the same price. In Australia, motor vehicles are now taxed at 15 per cent, 20 per cent or 30 per cent, depending on the whim of the Government, whether it is logical or not.

         If a school bus is government owned, it is not subject to any sales tax. However, if it is privately owned, it is subject to a 20 per cent sales tax rate. In other words, the Government owned variety is sales tax exempt, whilst the privately owned and run school bus is burdened with a 20 per cent sales tax. These school buses are often used privately to run children to sporting activities or bring them to school, yet the proprietors have to pay a 20 per cent sales tax rate. There is no relief.

         â€”Absolutely no rebate, as the honourable member for Wakefield saysâ€”a situation we would rectify. Coach lines and tourist buses are two of the few exceptions where sales tax exemptions are operative. If these vehicles, whether they be coach lines or tourist buses, are operating for reward, that is, charging passengers a fare, they are considered sales tax exempt. That is where they differ from the privately owned bus. They are, therefore, not burdened with the 15 or 20 per cent rate of sales tax. That is certainly a sensible scenario. A vehicle operating in such circumstances is running as a business; the bus is in fact a business input and should not be taxed. By exempting buses from the burden of sales tax the Government has accepted the principle that business inputs should remain free of such a tax impost. Of course, that is the principle that applies consistently throughout our Fightback package in the area of sales tax.

         On the other hand, a plumber who buys a utility or panel van for use in his or her business receives no such sales tax exemption. What does he or she pay? It is twenty per cent sales tax on the business vehicle. A furniture removalist who buys a pantechnicon, a truck or a lorry for his or her business does not receive any sales tax exemption. What does he or she pay?  It is 20 per cent, not 15 per centâ€”and no relief. Yet this is another business input. Heavy transport operators are massive losers. They pay thousands of dollars of sales tax on their vehicles and equipment, but they are not given any tax relief in this package. It applies to the tarpaulins of the transport operators, it applies to their stock crates or their refrigerated vans.

         The Prime Minister's economic statement re-emphasised his Government's policy of discrimination clearly against the productive sector. This Government's mentality is to tax the productive sector until it is incapable of producing and operating. This statement should have addressed the removal of taxes from our export industriesâ€”all business inputs, not just some. We have seen in the statement that there is going to be some relief for some motor vehicle operators but not the business sector; school buses are exempt if they are government owned but if they are privately owned, they are not. The list goes on with its inconsistencies. Of course, if there is ever a time when we should be addressing the need to increase our export competitiveness and drive our export sector along, it is now. That was confirmed by yesterday's balance of payment figures where we saw another deficit, one of $861m that is owed to overseas countries. That is another $861m which will be added to the $144 billion bill that we have outstanding. Whilst we have these sales taxes on our business inputs, export industries have no hope of ever being able to compete with the rest of the world.

         I want to turn my attention back to the man on the land and raise a further objection to the levelling of the 20 per cent sales tax on the humble Australian farm ute. This vehicle is made in Australia and its sale would promote Australian jobs. Sales tax exemption laws, as they apply to primary production and mining, allow for the purchase of a four-wheel-drive, one tonne, tray-top vehicle. The miner or farmer may purchase this vehicle free of sales tax if an undertaking can be given that it will be used 50 per cent of the time in the process of production. Ironically, this vehicle is not manufactured in Australia. The Australian made farm uteâ€”the Falcon or Commodoreâ€”is, and its manufacture would create jobs; but it cannot be bought sales tax exempt.

I believe this figure reflects the fact that one-tonne tray top four-wheel drive vehicles are tax exempt for farmers, but the Australian-made farm ute is not. This figure, as I said to the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) is quite alarming. If we are to get jobs, we have to consider and address the inconsistencies in this Bill.

However, the one million unemployed or the four million Australians earning less than $20,700 do not have the spare $25,000 to $35,000 to purchase a new Holden Commodore or Ford Falcon, regardless of whether it is $800 cheaper or not.

Furthermore, the 15 per cent collected on all new motor vehicles under a coalition government would be completely refundable if the vehicle were bought for commercial or business purposes, no matter whether the vehicle was a tourist bus, a prime mover or the humble Australian farm ute.

         It might interest some people in this House, particularly those on the other side, to know that in recent reports published on the motor car industry in Australiaâ€”the Industry Commission report and reports by the Motor Industry Authorityâ€”it has been made clear that productivity in the Australian motor vehicle industry is comparable with that of Europe. It is not comparable with that of Japan or Korea, and that is understandable: nor is any other part of the world comparable with those markets and it must be said that the production runs in those places are certainly hardly comparable with that of Australia.

         The honourable member for McPherson said that this Government had built walls of protection around the motor car industry. Anyone who knows anything about the motor car industry knows that is a totally false statement made for political purposes, with no basis in fact. The motor car industry's protection has been reduced under this Government from 140 per cent in 1980â€”the last time it was adjusted by the conservative governments under the 1980 plan; they are official figuresâ€”to 25 per cent at the end of the current plan.

I do not remember Sir John McEwen ever leading the Australian Labor Party. I do not think many people in this place would now be prepared to stand up for the McEwen plan for the motor vehicle industry. The McEwen plan applied for a considerable period of time and was only replaced by the Whitlam Government, only to have protection increased and altered after the advent of the Fraser Government. So do not let us talk about who provided the protection.

In fact 20 per cent wholesale is the equivalent of 15 per cent retail so that people who suggest there is going to be a reduction in those 20 per cent vehicles by a change to the 15 per cent wholesale tax are misleading.

         This tax reduction was brought in to try to halt a slide in an industry which is very important to my electorate. The class of vehicles is clearly set out in the Customs definitions. These definitions were not thought up a fortnight ago; they have been there for some time. If dealers do not know, it is because they did not find outâ€”and I doubt that they do not know. This tax reduction is an attempt to encourage people to buy vehicles which are made in Australia, because all of the Australian made vehicles, with the possible exception of the two at the top of the Holden and Ford ranges, fall into the category of cars which are in the 20 per cent range.

If it stops the fall in the sale of cars and, therefore, maintains employment in that industry, I will be satisfied but disappointed. But I am prepared to say to this House that there will be an increase in car sales in the areas where the sales tax reduction has taken place. As the majority of cars in that area are substantially manufactured in Australia, people in my electorateâ€”who work for the Ford Motor Co., in that caseâ€”will gain employment. If they gain employment, or maintain employment, it is a worthwhile move. There will be no benefit for them from reducing the price of luxury vehicles, as is proposed under the GST. As I have already said, under the GST there will be a $15,000 savingâ€”$12,000 on a Jaguar. But compared with existing arrangements, the price of a Falcon will go up $700 under the GST.

The Ford Motor Co. has recently invested $40m in Australia. It did not invest it because it thought its workers were not good. The company is in trouble in the United States, as I think everyone knows, but it has invested $40m in new plant and equipment and it has another investment package on the way. It has confidence in Australians to produce motor cars in a competitive form, even though it will not take as many people to do so.

         Confidence exists, but we have knocking, whining, ill-informed people in this House who see their political future, not Australia's future, as paramount, who stand here and talk about who brought in the overprotection of the car industry. Do not let us have any mistake about that. The first was John McEwen and the second was Phillip Lynch. There was 140 per cent protection when we came to officeâ€”and the honourable member for McPherson stood up and said that this Government has created protection in the industry! I hope the industry can stand the reduction in protection that has taken place, because it has been massive over the last eight years. I support this Bill. I hope it achieves the purposes for which it was set out: to maintain and create jobs in the car industry.

As the member for a large rural electorate, I do not claim to have the understanding of the motor vehicle industry that he clearly displays, given the location of the electorate of Corio.

         I think, however, that he was at the very least ungracious in the remarks he levelled at the Opposition. He presumed that we have been guilty by association of being prepared to offer protection to the car industry, and he failed to point out that this Oppositionâ€”the Liberal and National partiesâ€”has been supportive of the Government for the past 10 years in the changes that have been made to tariff protection in Australia. He might have given a good deal more credence to his remarks had he been prepared to pause and recognise that it is a damn sight easier for the Opposition to oppose the Government than to support it.

He stood up and said that the GST, proposed as an alternative to the sales tax being debated in this House, was being put forward to deliver everything;  that we, the Opposition, had painted some sort of utopia arising in Australia as a result of the GST.

The honourable member for Corio says that the GST is blatantly dishonest and deceitful, and designed to hide various tax changes. Exactly the opposite is the case. Why would we, probably 12 months from a poll, propose so dramatic a change and document it in such detail if we were not prepared to debate it?

While the Government has wanted to trundle in all sorts of statistics, without necessarily giving them a base and making a direct comparison between its One Nation package and the Fightback package, the people of Australia have been left perplexed, not knowing whether one option or the other is attractive. I suggest to the people of Australia that they would do themselves a service if they paused, not to be confused by all the statistics that have deceitfully come into this Parliament, but to ask themselves why on earth an Opposition would be prepared to put in such detail and table it in the Parliament if it were not prepared to stand by those statistics and did not believe they were in the national interest.

         Madam Deputy Speaker, you know why. The shadow Minister at the table, the honourable member for Gippsland (Mr McGauran), knows why, and I know why. It is because this nation is so far in debt that only a dramatic change in the way in which we can go about levelling tax will provide an opportunity to lift us out of debtâ€”$163 billion in debt, so the newspaper told me yesterday, having gone up from about $38 billion when we lost office. This is what this Government is bequeathing to the people of Australia and we, the Opposition, as the alternative government, have proposed sales tax changes to enable us to go about repaying that debt.

In 20 years, under both Liberal-National Party and ALP governments, that has never been done. That is why we say that our attitude to sales tax has to change.

         We propose dramatic changes, dramatic changes that directly affect the legislation currently before the House. We propose to remove the wholesale sales tax altogether and replace it with a goods and services tax. Why? Because the application of a sales tax, on Australian motor vehicles and all sorts of goods, is unfair. Does the House know that, for example, we do not pay a wholesale sales tax on an in-ground pool, but we do pay it on an above-ground pool? What does that say to the people opposite who pretend to represent the people who are more likely to put in above-ground pools than in-ground pools? People do not pay wholesale sales tax on built-in wardrobes, but they do if they buy a wardrobe and bring it into the house. They do not pay wholesale sales tax on toothpaste, but they do on toothbrushes. They do not pay it on cotton buds, but they do on cotton wool. It is an absurd tax. In order to change the Australian attitude to tax, we propose to take away sales tax altogether.

As the amendment says, for that reason we will commit ourselves to the people of Australia when we are in government, and the ALP, if it had any gumption, would stand as it did when its present Prime Minister (Mr Keating) advocated the very changes that we see are now necessary in the tax system.

As the honourable member for Maranoa has pointed out, a small businessman who drives a utility or a delivery van or a farmer who says, `The way in which I run my farm means that a ute is an essential part of my business' would not be able to get the reduction from 20 per cent to 15 per cent that is being offered in the One Nation package.

But, frankly, grateful though my constituents are for the gesture, what the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade (Senator Gareth Evans) is doing in the GATT negotiations is far more important to them.

As the amendment by the honourable member for Curtin points out, we propose to remove the sales tax altogether and replace it with a goods and services tax. But that would not be an additional cost to business. Every business cost that incurred a GST would have the GST rebated against it so the real cost effectively fell.

It will be replaced by a GST and the GST will be rebated to him because the rig is part of his business cost. The tyres, the fan belt and the spare parts that make up that trucking rig, and which currently bear a wholesale sales tax, will not bear it any more because the wholesale sales tax goes under the Fightback package and is replaced by a GST which is rebated to that trucking operator because it is an effective business cost. And as if that were not enough, in addition we remove the petroleum excise from fuel and replace it with a GST. But that is tax neutral because the fuel, wherever it is incurred as a business cost, has the GST on it rebated as well.

         What has to be understood is that between 75 per cent and 80 per cent of farmers' costs are fixed. The input costs are beyond the farm gate. So a farmer has control only over 25 per centâ€”or 30 per cent at the very bestâ€”of his or her own costs. Consequently, when the Fightback package abolishes wholesale sales tax, payroll tax and fuel tax, all of this is terribly important to the competitiveness of a farm because it means that, when the products actually go beyond the farm gate to be processed or exported, they are that much more competitive.

         Moreover, for farmers there are direct benefits in the Fightback package, particularly through the tax system where we lift the tax free threshold from $5,400 to $7,000 and for incomes up to $20,000 the tax rate is reduced from 20 per cent to 16.2 per cent. Compare that with the Government's One Nation package, which almost mysteriously discriminates against low income earners, in that people with incomes up to $20,700 a year receive no tax cuts whatsoever. They will continue to pay the 20 per cent tax rate. It is amazing that the Government would abandon four million workers and income recipientsâ€”farmers, students, retirees and low income earners making up almost half the work force, or half the Australian adult population.

         â€”A number of speakers have referred to the fact that not all vehicles are going to have their rate of wholesale sales tax cut. Without going into any detail, the basic rationale is that the ones on which the Government has reduced the rate of sales tax are those which are subject to the relatively higher rate of customs tariff, for instance, 35 per cent on imported vehicles. It was felt that, given that most of those other categories of motor vehiclesâ€”commercial vehiclesâ€”do enjoy a significantly lower rate of customs tariff, and given the relatively high proportion of those that are imported, the basic set of decisions that we have taken is appropriate. I also say that this issue, in a sense, reflects the general distinction between the Government and the Opposition. We are seeking a structure of the wholesale sales tax which, while it does have different rates, is inherently progressive; whereas the Opposition is going for a flat rate which the Government and I would argue is inherently regressive.

         â€”The Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill is an omnibus Bill which makes a number of amendments to the Customs Act 1901 and the Excise Act 1901. Essentially, the Bill makes three key proposals. It also includes a number of minor technical amendments. Before I turn my attention to the detail of the Bill and the amendments which have been put in place, I would like to express my concern to the Minister for Small Business, Construction and Customs (Mr Beddall) in the strongest possible terms about the time given to both the coalition and the industry to study the Bill. The Bill was introduced into the House only last Wednesday, the day before the failed `One Job' statement of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating). We are debating this legislation just one week later.

         It is worth putting on the record that the representatives of the industry who are most affected by this legislation, namely, the customs agents and importers, received their copy only last Fridayâ€”three working days ago. Given that most of the industry representatives operate their own businesses and participate in industry activities outside working hours, the Minister has given them little or no time to convene a meeting and to give the Bill the full scrutiny which it deserves. However, in spite of this the Minister probably expects support from these organisations for the initiatives which we are debating here tonight.

         It is interesting to note that this legislation was scheduled to be introduced into the House of Representatives late last year. But because of a lack of time the Bill was held over until this parliamentary session. I am making this point for a simple reason: the Bill obviously has been ready in its final form for quite some timeâ€”since December of last year at least. I see no reason why the Minister could not have circulated a draft copy of the Bill to me, to members of the customs agents' industry and to the Law Reform Commission to give us all time to study this Bill thoroughly.

         I am raising this matter because I understand that two other Customs Bills are to be introduced and debated this session. Perhaps the Minister will give his assurance in the course of his final remarks that in debating that legislation we will not have a repeat of this week's events. Finally, I would like to place on record my thanks to the head of the Legal Services Branch of the Australian Customs Service, Mr Ken McInnes, for making himself available over the weekend to provide a briefing on the provisions of this Bill.

However, I give notice that I will be moving a second reading amendment toward the conclusion of my remarks. Also, I foreshadow the coalition's intention to refer this Bill, for reasons that I will outline later, to the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology for scrutiny.

         As I have already mentioned, as well as a number of minor technical amendments, the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill makes three key proposals: it provides the legislative framework for the electronic lodgment of information relating to imported goods; it provides for the advance reporting of prescribed information for ships and aircraft at all domestic ports of call; and it amends the administration and accountability of claims for rebate under the diesel fuel rebate scheme.

         Given that each of these amendments proposes significant change, I would like to address each of them individually. The first proposal amends the Customs Act 1901 to put into place the framework to facilitate the introduction of the electronic transmission to the Australian Customs Service of information concerning imported goods. It also provides for the electronic lodgment of import entries and entry authorisation in respect of such goods.

         The system to be implemented, known as Compile, will be along the lines of the current structure for the electronic lodgment of export data; indeed, the Compile system has been developed to complement and operate in conjunction with the existing electronic export lodgment regime. This amendment will result in some benefits to both customs agents and importers. To start with, the administrative arrangements will be streamlined and the paperwork burden reduced. This will have a positive impact on agents and importers' cost structure, although I suspect it will be quite minimal. Obviously, the coalition welcomes this. Any reduction in the burden placed on business can only be a good thing.

         I would like to point out that the benefits that will accrue to business from this measure pale into insignificance when compared with the comprehensive initiatives contained in the coalition's Fightback package. Just to illustrate, the coalition will remove the burden of wholesale sales tax from all inputs to business. In the case of customs agents' business, we will abolish the 20 per cent wholesale sales tax on computers, phones, office furniture and all office stationery. The sales tax on a company motor vehicle will be removed, as will fuel exciseâ€”something which I will refer to later in the course of my remarks.

         We will complement this measure by rebating all of the GST paid on business inputs as well as eliminating payroll tax, the training levy and customs duty. In contrast to the Government, the coalition will undertake comprehensive and meaningful reforms which will result in significant and sustainable benefits to business. Indeed, compared with the coalition's program, one could say that the initiatives proposed by this Bill merely tinker at the edges of a highly uncompetitive and expensive business cost structure.

         Secondly, the electronic lodgment of import information, as provided by this Bill, will allow importers faster access to their cargo. As the procedure currently stands, customs agents are required to manually convey to customs officers all of the appropriate material regarding the importation of cargo. Customs officers are generally located in a Customs house in each capital city and major regional centres.

         Assessment of the application and advice on authorisation to collect the goods take a minimum of four hours; although it is interesting to note that 10 years ago the same procedure took two weeks. The system which the Bill will put in place will cut the assessment time from four hours to around 10 minutesâ€”a substantial saving in anyone's language. This is achievable because all of the information which previously had to be hand delivered will now be conveyed to Customs electronically. Likewise, the assessment of a cargo, including risk assessment and the notification of authorisation to collect the goods or, alternatively, of the need to provide additional information, will also be communicated back to the importer or agent electronically.

       <para>
        goods into tariff categories and which assess the duty payable can already be used by customs agents. The passing of this legislation will allow customs agents to press the button, so to speak, so that they can convey and receive all the information via computer. Given that the Compile system is already in place and largely operational, it is prudent to make some remarks on its performance.

         I am advised by the users of the system that it is efficient and most effective; indeed, I understand that last year Compile received a Public Service award commending its efficiency and operationâ€”although I suspect that the significance of this award is undermined somewhat given that Compile was compared only with other government computer systems rather than the entire private sector system.

         There are, however, a number of problems with both the profile element of Compile and with Tap-inâ€”a computer system designed by Customs to complement the Compile system. Tap-in is the reference tool leading to the creation of an import entry and its subsequent transmission to Customs via Compile. Tap-in provides a database containing the Customs Act, tariff classifications, rates of duty, as well as other information. The operational capacity of Tap-in, from a Customs agent's perspective, is less than desirable.

         Indeed, in spite of the system's potential benefits, many customs agents refuse to use it. There is a desperate need for this system to be re-figured and updated so that it is in line with current legislation, tariff classifications and valuations. Similarly, there is a need for some amendments to the profiles contained in the Compile system. I am advised that it is difficult for brokers to determine the differences between the requirements of the National Parks and Wildlife Service, the Australian Quarantine Service and the community protection obligations of the Australian Customs Service.

         For example, Compile fails to differentiate between different types of sporting goods. The system will ask for quarantine details on all sporting goods which are entered into the system, when it is really only sporting goods using animal or natural fibres which need to be assessed for quarantine purposes. This increases the administration of import entries, adds to the assessment time of goods and represents some delay to importers.

         The Government should take the opportunity to update and upgrade the profiles contained in the Compile system in the lead-up to its becoming fully operational.

         My other concerns about the Compile system lie not so much with the legislative framework as with the introduction and administration of the scheme. Specifically I am concerned about the content and the format of the new deed of agreement between the Australian Customs Service and individual agents, which authorises and outlines the conditions of use of Compile and, more particularly, electronic lodgment.

         When the electronic lodgment of Customs entries, as opposed to the transmission of these entries, was introduced the Australian Customs Service presented to customs agents the deed of agreement, which was, they stated, final. Indeed, it was presented to the agents as either take it or leave it, in a manner of speakingâ€”hardly a fitting attitude for a government department which relies on extensive public contact in order to successfully carry out its brief. It is gratifying to note, therefore, that Customs did weaken and allow discussion on the agreement. However, it took some three months of ongoing negotiations before a final position agreeable to both parties was reached.

         I put it to you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that this is not a satisfactory state of affairs. Consequently, I am seeking from the Minister an assurance that these circumstances will not be repeated in the course of developing the new Compile deed of agreement. Indeed, the Minister should take some action to ensure the draft agreement is circulated for discussion and the appropriate negotiation period is allowedâ€”although, as I understand it, the Australian Customs Service undertook to supply the Customs Brokers Council of Australia with a list of the changes proposed to the existing deed of agreement for consideration. The Customs Service undertook to distribute this by the end of January. It is now nearly the middle of March, and we have not yet seen anything.

         In scrutinising this Bill, albeit in the very short time given, I was pleased to note that the Customs Service has put in place appropriate measures to guarantee the security of information supplied by importers. The security measures introduced by this Bill include the allocation to each importer of a unique identity code known as the PIN number. The computer system will cross-reference this PIN number with other information contained in its database to verify the legality of the user and will hence allow access to the network.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         There is, however, some confusion about legality regarding the use of the PIN number, namely, whether it falls on the individual user or on the corporate identity. This is something which needs to be studied more thoroughly. I am sure this will occur as the Bill moves through the Senate and through the committee process. Secondly, there is some concern about issuing the new passwords over the phone. While this is only done when an old PIN number has been lost, it still represents a high risk operation.

         In concluding my remarks on this portion of the Bill, I would like to point out that the use of the electronic lodgment system is optional. The current manual lodgment system will remain in place. As such, there is no need for importers, unless they so desire, to spend vast sums of money to purchase new computer hardware. As I have already mentioned, the Compile software is compatible with the existing export lodgment system software, thus removing the need for business to upgrade or purchase new equipment.

         The second proposal in the Bill provides for appropriate information to be transmitted by an aircraft or ship prior to its arrival in a domestic port. Under the previous legislation ship masters and aircraft captains were required to present to Customs officers upon or within 24 hours of arrival the details of cargo being carried. A 1990 amendment to the Customs Act provided for this information to be lodged electronically prior to the arrival of the vessel at the first Australian port of call. The prescribed information is still to be presented by hand upon arrival at all subsequent ports.

         The advanced reporting regime has given Customs the opportunity to better scrutinise cargo and assess and target risks. Indeed, it is in line with the Customs community obligation protection requirements. The regime has given importers faster access to cargo carried on board vessels when that cargo is unloaded at the first port of call. Again, this can only be of benefit to business. I should point out that there are some anomalies in that this facility is only available to importers when the goods are unloaded at the first port of call. There is still some time delay when cargo is unloaded at subsequent domestic ports of call. It is pleasing to note, therefore, that the Bill removes this anomaly by extending the advance reporting regime to all domestic ports of call or ships or aircraft. Consequently, all importers nationwide will have the same speedy access to their cargo.

         Secondly, the information to be provided has been extended to include the number and names of crew members on board, as well as the number of passengers carried. This will provide for the advanced checking of crew numbers and crew members and allow for the appropriate number of processing officers to be available for the passengers when the ship or aircraft arrives. The initiative should result in a more streamlined method of processing passengers and crew, something which overseas travellers will welcome and which could possibly be described as well overdue.

         I now turn to the third element of the Bill, namely, the changes to the diesel fuel rebate scheme. That scheme provides for rebates of excise or customs duty on diesel fuel purchased for specific off-road uses in mining operations; primary production, including agriculture, fishing and forestry operations; and in residential premises; hospitals; nursing homes and homes for the aged. Excise and customs rates of duty on diesel fuel are adjusted in February and August each year in line with the movements in the CPI. Rebates differ between different categories of claimant.

        The Audit Office went on to identify the following key problems with the diesel fuel rebate scheme: the complexity of the eligibility criteria caused difficulties in determining which operations were eligible for rebate and to what extent; the payment of the rebate was based on a forecast of eligible use prepared by the claimant, as against actual use; weaknesses in the rebate control procedures included the fact that a variety of documentation was being accepted as proof of purchase of fuel; the extent of overpayments under the scheme was not known; and investigation functions were compromised to achieve processing targets.

         It is reassuring that this legislation is designed to address in part some of the administrative problems of the scheme.

         Before doing this, I take the opportunity to bring to the attention of the House what I regard as a very serious problem with the administration of the diesel fuel rebate scheme, a problem which, I might add, has had severe repercussions on business. Late last year it was brought to the attention of my office that the Tasmanian regional office of the Australian Customs Service had adopted an unofficial `go slow'. This was, I understand, in protest at the reduction in staff numbers in the Tasmanian regional office. Staff numbers were reduced from 101 in 1988-89 to 85 in 1990-91.

         I would not have thought that this was unusual, given the efficiency gains which were supposed to be achieved from award restructuring and other productivity measures. Customs officers obviously thought otherwise and indicated they were, in fact, overworked. One of the casualties of this `go slow' was the processing of claims for the diesel fuel rebate. Instead of the two to three weeks normally taken to process claims, the time ballooned to eight to 10 weeks. Some claimants waited well over three months to receive their rebate. We are not talking about insignificant amounts of money here. The average claim is for around $22,000, although a number of the claims were for amounts between $57,000 and $60,000.

         I might point out to the House that the claims were of this size because many loggers, who are large users of diesel fuel, submit their claims every two or three months. This is for a number of reasons but primarily to reduce their own administrative burden.

         Secondly, many loggers use their diesel fuel rebates as a financial safety net or as a means of meeting larger bills when they become due. Consequently, this unofficial `go slow' and the subsequent withholding of payments has had a devastating effect on the businesses of the claimants, something which will only compound the impact on businesses of the worst recession for 60 years. Indeed, one logger that I know of has been forced to put two of his trucks up for sale in order to pay his debts, which otherwise could have been met by this rebate. This is a deplorable situation.

        The Industry Commission concluded further that rates of petroleum excise were too high; that a strong case could be made for exempting the intermediate use of petroleum products from excise; and that a broadening of the community tax base by introducing a value added tax would have a number of benefits.

         Consequently, the coalition would scrap the fuel excise. That is what the Government should do if it is serious about fixing the problems in the economy today. It would abolish the fuel excise levy rather than proposing any more amendments. The benefits from the coalition's action plan would be substantial, particularly for all business. It would mean our businesses would become more productive and more competitive and able to gain a true world competitive standard. For business it would mean that fuel prices would drop by 26c per litre, as all input costs to business would be rebatable. The present wholesale sales tax system is a cost on our exports of $1.7 billion. If we are truly to get our industries and our domestic market world competitive, we need these sorts of amendments and changes to the system. This Bill does not pick up that amendment.

         In conclusion, I would like to reiterate the coalition's position on this Bill. We support the broad thrust of the amendments being proposed by this legislation. We are, however, concerned about the haste with which it has been introduced and rushed through the House. The natural consequence of this is that both we and members of the industry who are most affected by the amendments have had little time to study them. Indeed, we have not been in a position to give the Bill the full and frank scrutiny it deserves.

         Secondly, we are concerned about the lack of consultation undertaken by the Customs Service, particularly with regard to what will be a revolutionary new scheme. Therefore, to allow community discussion and to facilitate more thorough scrutiny of the provisions of the Bill, when the Bill reaches the Senate chamber we will be seeking to refer it to the Senate Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology for consideration.

         â€”The Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill 1992 is an omnibus measure proposing a series of amendments to the Customs Act 1901 and the Excise Act 1901. There are three main proposals in this Bill. The Opposition has moved a second reading amendment which the Government will oppose, and which I will certainly oppose. The Bill proposes firstly to amend the Customs Act 1901 to provide the legislative framework for the electronic transmission to the Australian Customs Service of information concerning imported goods, and the electronic lodgment of import entries in respect of such goods.

         The Bill proposes secondly to amend provisions of the Customs Act relating to the advance reporting regime for ships and aircraft and their cargo, passengers and crew, to enhance the operation of that scheme. The third amendment proposed to the Customs Act is to improve the accountability and administration of the diesel fuel rebate scheme in response to the Audit Report No. 27 of 1990-91 by the Australian National Audit Office, tabled in the Parliament on 16 May 1991.

         The proposed amendments for the electronic communication and lodgment of import information are a continuation of the improvements and updating of entry facilities which were initiated by the EXIT amendments for export information introduced into the Customs Act by Act No. 111 of 1990. With regard to cargo reporting, the proposed amendments will enhance the ability of Customs to fully risk-assess incoming cargo, crew and passengers for the detection of narcotics and other prohibited imports by ensuring that all advanced reports are communicated to Customs at each port or airport of call in Australia rather than only at the first port or airport of arrival. This is important because drugs certainly are a massive problem for the Western world. It is necessary for us to streamline our efforts through every avenue open to us to prohibit the entry of prohibited drugs.

         I would like to compliment the Australian Customs Service. It does an admirable job. It is always very easy to find fault with or to criticise various departments, but Customs has always done an outstanding job, particularly these days with sophistication, massive air travel and shipping, particularly in the north of this country. There should be recognition of the dedication of the men and women involved in our Customs Service. In relation to diesel fuel rebate, there is a benefit to agriculture of approximately half a billion dollars per annum, something that deserves recognition. Of course, this leads to a reduction in input costs, which also deserves recognition.

         I also compliment the Minister for Small Business, Construction and Customs (Mr Beddall) for the way in which he is handling his portfolio. There is often rhetoric and emotion involved in accusations of dumping in this country and accusations of action that should be stopped immediately. There are proper procedures through the Customs Service and through the Anti-Dumping Authority.

        I had already informed the editor that the Government had an inquiry under way and we needed the cooperation of the six State governments to achieve labelling of foods products. As of 28 February the new National Food Authority foods standard took effect, which means that now all the imported, unpackaged fruit, vegetables, fish and nuts on sale to the general public must have their country of origin or a sign with `Imported' clearly displayed nearby. I do not know whether the editor of the
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">

         The rhetoric and the nonsense that comes from particularly National Party politicians and supporters in Queensland often disappoints me.

         The shadow Minister for primary industries in Queensland, Trevor Perrett from the electorate of Barambah, recently came out in a scattergun approach and said that heavily subsidised and dumped products are flooding into Australia and destroying Australian markets. The point is that $6.3 billion worth of processed and semiprocessed Australian food product is exported annuallyâ€”right now! If we took the advice of this character, the shadow Minister for primary industries, we would see retaliatory action which would devastate the beef industry, the sugar industry, the wheat industry, the wool industryâ€”the large industries. We have to find markets for some 80 per cent of these industries because we have such a small domestic market.

It is just unfortunate that they do not have the courage to tell their own supporters the truth. It is a great pity that the National Party does not pay some of these clowns to go over to Europe and find out what the real trade scene is about instead of attacking the Customs Service, the ADA or the Government.

         I now move on to the amendment moved by the Opposition to the second reading of this Bill referring to the abolition of the excise duty on fuel, including diesel fuel. The Opposition has been asked several times how it is going to fund roads and it has not responded. The Opposition has said that it is going to use road user charging. The honourable member for Maranoa (Mr Bruce Scott) has a large electorate like mine and I would like to ask him what level of road user charging he is going to put on semitrailers, four-wheel drives and ordinary vehicles. If the Opposition were to take fuel excise away, unless it would allow roads to run down it would have to put thousands of dollars of registration fees on people, up frontâ€”a one-off hit, a one-off whack. It would not be user pays as under the present system, but a one-off whack. As I have said in this House before, I would like to see the local government authority in Queensland put those opposite under scrutiny, because so far it has been very quiet on an issue that directly affects its livelihood, that is, roads.

         The Opposition should come clean and say exactly what level of road user charging it is going to use if it abolishes excise, because at this stage it has not said what it is going to do. As to the rhetoric about the money from excise not all going into roads, which has been doing the rounds for ages, I point out that all bar about 5c per litre goes into road use and road trauma; only about 5c does not. That amount goes into education, defence and all the other services that are provided in this country. Again, when the Opposition is put to the test as to what areas it will fund if excise is taken away, it simply does not answer. That is why I would like to see this issue of road user charges answered by the Opposition, because we have to fund roads and, if the Opposition wants to abolish excise, it would have to find the money from somewhere. That has not been said. That is a challenge that needs to be met.

If we followed his line and banned imported pork, I wonder what he would say when the United States of America and Canada retaliated and banned our beef exports. I suppose he would then try to find a genie to pull out of his hat or to blame somebody else. The problem is that these cowboys need to get their facts straight if they want to get into the real world. If they want to talk about trade, they need to know what they are talking about, not simply to try to please the preselection process of their own local National Party of Australia and the League of Rights in the South Burnett.

What did honourable members opposite do? They opposed one of the most equitable taxes we have ever brought in. That money goes into the family allowance supplement.

The Government has created a little bit of equity right across the system. That is why I will not have a bar of these amendments, because they are unfair, unjust and un-Australian.

         In addressing the Customs and Excise Legislation Amendment Bill this evening, I would like to direct my comments exclusively to the diesel fuel rebate scheme. The legislation before the House is designed to correct deficiencies in the administration of the scheme. The requirement to lodge original purchase invoices with each claim will be removed and during 1992 the Government expects to present new regulations to enable invoices to be replaced by a schedule of fuel purchases prepared by the claimant. I must say that this is a sensible approach.

         It would be remiss of me to ignore the more alarming deficiencies, and indeed inequities, in the diesel fuel rebate scheme. Diesel fuel rebate exemptions fall into nine categories. They are farming, forestry, commercial fishing, residential premises, mining, medical institutions, hospitals, nursing homes and aged people's homes. I have to wonder how the Government arrived at these categories.

         I think it is a bit like a game we used to play when we were kids, pin the tail on the donkey. The Government is not sure what it should exempt, how it should exempt and where it should exempt so it is taking a wild guess and, as I said, it is a bit like pinning the tail on the donkey in order to make a decision.

         The very fact that exemptions exist denotes the importance to the belief, upheld by the coalition forcesâ€”the Liberal Party of Australia and the National Party of Australiaâ€”that taxes on business inputs should be fully rebatable. As we examine the list further, we can see that mining and farming are eligible for a diesel fuel tax rebate. But what about Avgas? What about petrol that is used in these industries?  So often a petrol-driven machine is seen working beside and complementing a diesel-driven machine. We are faced with the ridiculous situation where a diesel-powered machine is operated tax free while its petrol-driven counterpart is subjected to fuel excise.

         Let me give the House an example. I hope the honourable member for Hinkler (Mr Courtice) is listening because he has condemned these amendments tonight. Just look at the statistics of how many new tractors, new headers or new harvesters have been purchased by farmers over the last nine or 10 years. There has been very little investment in new machinery. There is a very good reason why this is so and it is certainly one of the reasons agriculture is in decline, because farmers have not been able to afford to upgrade their machinery.

         Take a diesel-driven harvester out in the paddock harvesting grain. There are still quite a lot of petrol-driven machines harvesting grain. There is the diesel-driven machine, with no tax on it, going down the paddock and beside it is one driven by petrol, with a tax on it. It delivers the grain into a truck and the grain will be taken to the on-farm storage. The truck will be a petrol-driven truck, or it could be a diesel, but in either case this same inequity exists. If a farmer has a diesel harvester, he will get a rebate; if he has a petrol one, he will be paying the tax.

If it is a diesel machine, he gets it tax free. I have never seen a more glaring inequity.

         Aviation gasoline, which is used in agricultural aerial work, including mustering, is also subject to a fuel excise. The farmers and graziers are footing the bill for airport infrastructure and air traffic control that they derive no benefit from. Avgas excise amounts to $6.5m per year in the agricultural sector. These machines, helicopters and light aeroplanes are used in mustering; they are used in the day-to-day operations of checking waters and fences on properties. They rarely see a civil airport. Most of the maintenance is done on the property, yet the farmers and graziers are paying $6.5m a year in avgas excise, for no benefit. It is purely and straight out a tax on the day-to-day operation of the farm. Another good point about our Fightback package is that we are going to abolish fuel tax. No ifs and buts; no diesel only or petrol. It is diesel; it is petrol; it is avgas.

         Another blatant inequity is the example of the commercial fishing boat, compared with the tourist vessel. Whereas the commercial fisherman can claim a diesel fuel tax rebate, the tourist operator cannot. I have to ask the honourable member for Hinkler why the commercial fisherman can claim a diesel tax fuel rebate but the tourist operator cannot. Does this mean that the Government is placing a greater emphasis on the commercial fisherman over the tourism operator who takes the boat out to the Whitsundays or the Barrier Reef? We all know how important the tourism industry is to us, so why should we want to discriminate between the two? After all, tourism is Australia's fastest growing industry, the largest private sector employer and the biggest earner of foreign exchange for the nation.

         I must qualify `biggest earner'. In Question Time this afternoon the Minister for Tourism (Mr Griffiths) said that it is a very important industryâ€”and I acknowledge that; it is. However, it provides gross income to the nation, not net income. I hope that the Minister takes note of that. Whilst we may earn $7 billion a year gross from tourism, Australians also travel overseas and spend almost the same amount out of the country. Nevertheless, tourism is a very important job creator, and I ask why we discriminate between the commercial fisherman and the tourism operator. I really do not believe that we have had an adequate answer from any members of the Government in their speeches. It is just a case of the Government not knowing the donkey's head from the donkey's rumpâ€”to revert to my `pin the tail on the donkey' analogy.

         The diesel fuel rebate scheme is absolutely riddled with inequities. For example, why are residential premises entitled to a diesel rebate on electricity generation, while electricity authorities are not? I have four or five towns in the west of my electorate: Bedourie, Birdsville, Windorah and Jundah, all of which get their electricity through the electricity authority putting a diesel driven generating plant in their towns. They are very small towns, but those electricity authorities pay fuel tax to generate that electricity for those small towns. Yet if the electricity were generated at a residence, there would be no tax. I suggest to the honourable member for Kennedy (Mr Hulls) that he would certainly have been well off in here tonight addressing some of these problems, because he would have quite a few towns in his electorate with similar problems.

         Fuel tax was originally introduced for the sole purpose of funding road maintenance and construction. Over the Labor Government years, fuel excise tax has been used to fill the Government's coffers. It has become a revenue raising mechanism. It is not being used for the original purpose for which it was brought into this House. Despite a 120 per cent increase in fuel taxes over the Labor years, road funding has fallen by 20 per cent in real terms. I know that that contradicts the honourable member for Hinkler, who I notice has left the House. I guess it is just that he does not like to hear the truth of the matter. Furthermoreâ€”and conveniently for the Governmentâ€”it is no longer necessary to introduce legislation to increase excise payable. It is adjusted automatically twice a year with the CPI. It requires only the stroke of a pen. Surely this is a case of inflation breeding more inflation.

         The railways of Australia are a very important part of our infrastructure. In 1990-91 the Australian railway systems consumed a massive 514.3 million litres of diesel fuel. The railways paid a total product excise on that fuel of $130.14m. This Government has just woken up to the fact that it had better do something about these shiny railways. It is saying, `We have been using them as a revenue source, but now we had better start putting some of the money that they have been paying all the time we have been in government back into the rail system of Australia'.

A lot of this fuel tax ultimately is paid by the consumer. I would have thought that the honourable member for Hinkler might have stayed in the House and listened to this because he has cane trains in his electorate. The cane industry is a very important industry in his electorate. These cane trains are pulling cane from the farms to the crushing plant, and they are attracting fuel tax because they are diesel driven. The passengers, the tourists who come to Australia, pay the fuel tax in the price of the ticket they purchase to travel the coast of Queensland on the railways. In Queensland alone, $23.75m worth of fuel excise was paid to the Federal Government.

         The coalition government is going to abolish fuel tax and replace it with a 15 per cent goods and services tax. However, this GST will be refunded to business inputs, saving the Australian railways, for example, $130.14m. That is not an insignificant amount. It is a massive amount of tax which ultimately is paid by the consumer. So often it is an export industry that is paying that tax because so much of our export commodities are moved by rail for some part of the journey. The coalition is not talking about dabbling with the existing flagging wholesale sales tax regime; we are talking about comprehensive reform.

Barcoo Shire has a population of 454 men, women and childrenâ€”about 120 families. The headquarters of the Barcoo Shire is at Jundah and there is another office in Windorah. The outstanding figure, however, is that the gross value of agricultural production for this area amounts to $31.7m. That represents the combined work and effort of about 120 familiesâ€”as I say, 454 men, women and children. Last year the Barcoo Shire alone used 390,000 litres of fuel at an average cost of 66.6c per litre. Therefore, the Barcoo Shire paid a fuel excise bill of $90,000.

         Another example is the Diamantina Shireâ€”a very important shireâ€”which is on my far western boundary. It encompasses the towns of Birdsville and Bedourie.

The gross value of agricultural production and the combined work and effort of the people within the shire amounts to $15 1/2m. That figure is down a bit compared with the figure for Barcoo. The reason is that, in the last four to five years, the Diamantina Shire has been totally destocked because of the TB and brucellosis eradication campaign and is only now starting to restock. Even with those low stock numbers, the latest figures show that $15 1/2mâ€”mainly in export incomeâ€”has been generated in the Diamantina Shire.

         The contrast between the coalition's Fightback proposals and the Prime Minister's random mishmash of unfunded promises cobbled together with a wish list could not be greater. The unemployment problem this time around is worse because of the disappearance of a large number of unskilled jobs during the 1980s. Many of those jobs have disappeared forever. In the light of that stark occurrence, we need to examine the nation's skill base and ensure that Australians, and especially young Australians, are learning the skills that a modern, internationalised economy needs.

         The contrast of the Government's package with the Liberal-National coalition's program is dramatic, for the coalition has put forward a coherent strategy for jobs for the 1990s. The coalition's approach is to concentrate on growth through the creation of a more flexible economy, freed of the damaging centralised industrial relations system. Reforms to communications, the waterfront and transport will cut business costs and encourage new jobs in exporting industries. Enterprise bargaining and voluntary employment agreements will make wages, salaries and employment conditions more flexible; open job opportunities for young people; lift productivity; and create more wealth, more savings and, more importantly, more jobs. Education and training reforms will lift the skill levels of those seeking employment through more competitive, responsive and accessible training institutions.

         It has become painfully obvious that the Government is walking away from a whole generation of young Australians and burying its head in the sand over the extent of unemployment among young people. One reason for that may be that, in an interview on the

         earlier this week, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley) showed himself to be completely unfamiliar with the statistics relating to youth unemployment. In fact, in answer to a question from Richard Palfreyman, he said:

        That happens to be totally fallacious. The Minister has, in fact, shown that he cannot read a simple table. The figures that he quoted are the figures for those in employment in those two years in the 15- to 19-year-old category.

         If one looks at the total number of unemployed, one finds that in 1983 there were about 216,000. The figure today is about 218,000. The actual rate of unemployment has risen amongst young people from 25.9 per cent to 27.3 per cent. The number of underemployed young people has gone up from 58,600 to 105,500. It is quite clear that the Government has no real conception of the problem and its extent. This is revealed by this dramatic blunder by a senior Minister.

         There is an urgent need to integrate economic reform with education reform. Without the latter, without a better educated, better skilled work force, we as a nation will not be capable of taking maximum advantage of the opportunities offered by a modern, internationalised economy in a truly competitive and productive Australia. Does the Government make the vital connection?  Does the Government acknowledge the overriding importance of education and training on the way not just to economic recovery but to fundamental restructuring and revitalisation of the Australian economy? The answer would have to be a resounding no.

         One indicator of the difference in scope of Fightback's comprehensive policy for education and training and that of the Government's `One Job' package is the sheer amount of space the two documents devote to education and training. The Government's package gives seven pages to education and training and to the labour market. Fightback contains a comprehensive strategy covering 57 pages for education and training and a further 14 pages on labour market training programs and active assistance to help the unemployed.

         These differences in scale reflect enormous differences in substance. On the one hand, Fightback presents program decisions across the whole field of education and training, totalling some $3 billion for new programs across this decade, together with a comprehensive strategy of structural change for making schools, TAFEs and universities more responsive to the needs of those they serve. Fightback provides a comprehensive alternative to Labor's doctrine of mediocrity and bureaucratic control, a doctrine which dooms young Australians to falling further and further behind their peers in other nations.

         The Government's statement exemplifies the fact that education and training policy under Labor lurches from one preoccupation to the other, without any coherence or focus. In this statement schools are almost entirely neglected. The rigid centralisation and regulation of higher education which has locked out 50,000 qualified young Australians is maintained, and the focus has shifted almost entirely to TAFE.

There is one commitment to schools in the Government's package:  an increase of $7m this financial year for upgrading facilities and equipment in non-government schools and to underpin increased student retention rates. Next year there will be a one-off $15m increase, and the following year a one-off $8m.

         The first thing that has to be said about these increases in capital support for infrastructure spending is that they are derisory. Since 1981 the real value of capital grants per pupil has declined 29 per cent. Massive contributions to infrastructure spending are increasingly being called for from parents who want to exercise choice in their children's schooling. Existing needs and projected new needs for new schools have been costed by the National Catholic Education Commission at about $1 billion, yet on the present formula some 73 per cent of the capital expenditure will have to come from parish and community sources.

Fightback proposes a major commitment of resources to assist low and middle income families to exercise educational choice. Under a Hewson Government capital support for non-government schools will be doubled and per capita grants for low and middle income parents will be increased by up to $490 per annum per child. Parents will also have opportunities for choice within the government school sector expanded by a schools of choice program for state school systems.

Fightback recognises that to do this there must be a proper monitoring of standards and a willingness to invest in quality teaching. A national standards monitoring program will be established and major professional development initiatives for teachers undertaken.

Therefore, any suggestion whatever that access to higher education will be narrowed by the coalition's program is totally false.

All students who are currently funded by the taxpayer and who meet their educational obligations will continue to be funded by the coalition.

There is undoubtedly a pressing need to lift the level of skills in the work force and to give young Australians training of international standard. TAFE was badly neglected by the previous Minister for Employment, Education and Training, the present Treasurer (Mr Dawkins). His preoccupation was the amalgamation of the universities with the colleges of advanced education, and TAFE was simply left out in the cold, with no attention paid to how it might relate to the new mega-institutions the then Minister was intent on forcing into existence.

I think it has been a great credit, not only to the Government but particularly to the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), that in very difficult economic circumstances the Government has been able to put together a plan for recoveryâ€”a plan for long term expansionâ€”which has so obviously hit the right chord and attracted support from the overwhelming number of people in the community.

Another article in the same area was headed `Hewson Policy Misses'. I think that tells a pretty interesting story about the general attitude in the community to the issue of economic recovery. On the one hand the Government that, after all, is responsible in this nation for putting us on the road to economic recovery has put in place a responsible, effective plan which will lead to economic recovery, which is in the national interest, and which has picked up the best of all the ideas that were put forward by community groups, business, small business, the unions, social policy lobby groups and others. On the other hand, we see an Opposition that has sought to put in place a policy which is called Fightback. When we look at Fightback we can now get a clear impression of the differences between the two parties. There is no doubt the community is rapidly appreciating the difference. On the one hand we have a vital, effective economic package which has been put in place by the Government; on the other hand we have an effective one dimensional approach to policy by the Oppositionâ€”a GST.

         The sad thing about the Opposition is its inability to be able to develop a real and effective policy in the economic area. It has been its flaw and its failing for close on a decade now, and it certainly does not seem to be able to get out of it. As the Prime Minister has said on a number of occasions, when we look at the Opposition's package it has really been based on assumptions about what it could do that was different from the Government. As I said a moment ago, the Opposition has come up with one dimensional policy makingâ€”a GST, a GST, a GST. What is the solution to the economic problemsâ€”a GST. What is the solution to unemployment problemsâ€”a GST. What is the solution to environmental problemsâ€”a GST. What can help Fitzroy win the next premiershipâ€”a GST. That is the sort of approach the Opposition has got. It seems to have no policy settings at all, except simply applying a 15 per cent consumption tax.

         As we move to the next election we are going to see a realignment of forces in this nation. I think it is fair to say that traditionally many people in small business have been supporters of the Liberal Party, and possibly of the National Party. On this occasion we are going to see them deserting the Liberal and National parties in droves because they are now becoming acutely aware of the serious implications that the GST will have for them. When they look at economic recovery they will see that, on the one hand, the Labor Government proposes economic recoveryâ€”tax cuts without a 15 per cent consumption tax. On the other hand, they will see an opposition with few policy settings, but a flat-footed adherence to this GST whatever happens. I think we will soon enough see the results of that when the next general election comes around. Members of the community are going to reject the Opposition out of hand for seeking to thrust this unwanted tax on them.

         In my few remaining minutes, I want to deal with a couple of other matters. I am particularly delighted that the Government has chosen to implement such a wide ranging and important spending program in relation to infrastructure. I personally think this is long overdue, and I am delighted to see that we are now going to implement this program which will involve the expenditure of $1 billion on rail and road infrastructure over a three year period. I think it is well targeted expenditure. When I looked through the document produced by the Parliamentary Library on articles that have appeared in the national press in relation to the February economic statement, there was not one criticism that I could find of the Government's expenditure proposals in relation to infrastructure. That shows how well targeted the proposals are. Just to make it clear, there were comments in there that people wished other projects had been started as well, but I did not see one comment made in criticism of the projects that were chosen for special funding.

         In addition, the Government introduced a package which will see an expenditure of $860m on increased payments to low income families over a period of three years. How welcome that was. That is $3 per week for many families. That will certainly be a very worthwhile fillip to many people in the community who are suffering at the moment.

         In addition, of course, there was an extra $720m for capital works and places in the vocational education and training sector, including TAFE. I must say I thought the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp) had a fair bit of gall to be criticising the Federal Government on this score. When we look at the history of this Government over the past nearly 10 years now, one thing that we can say is an outstanding achievement of this Government is the improvement in the education system.

         â€”I was interested to hear the comments of the honourable member for Makin (Mr Duncan) on the Government's One Nation package. I remind the House that this is the fourth economic statement brought down in 12 months. That really makes one ask when the Government will get its policy settings right. Of course, we have also had four Treasurers in the same period. It really makes one wonder how this Government will hang together over the next 12 months, if it goes that far. That is the scenario in which we find ourselves debating the fourth economic statement in 12 months. This is the fourth time that the Government has tried to get Australia back on the rails after the disastrous eight years of government.

         The previous speaker, the honourable member for Makin, referred to our coalition Fightback package as being `one dimensional'. Of course, I reject that entirely. The package put together by the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and our National Party colleagues is comprehensive, well documented and has great support out in the community. I want to indicate the support of our present Prime Minister (Mr Keating) for this type of initiative by quoting his remarks on changing and reforming the taxation system in Australia. These remarks are from 1985 when he recognised that Australia's taxation system needed radical change. He said:

        There is a very clear choice. He is looking for another base to the taxation system. He went on to say:

       <para font-size="-=2">

        Who said that? Our Prime Minister. He described this much more extensively in three clear points outlining the reasons for and the advantages of a taxation system based on a GST. He said:

         We are having this debate tonight for two reasons: firstly, the Federal Government has to respond to a political set of circumstances to get back to setting the agenda and trying to be in front of the Opposition, because the Opposition has been running miles ahead of the Government; and, secondly, the Government has to re-stimulate the economy. There are two key factors in having this debate. There are political reasons because of the circumstances in which the Labor Government finds itself. We have a fourth statement in 12 months because the political reality is that the Government is down in the polls and the Prime Minister has to reassert his leadership in this countryâ€”or at least try to. Secondly, we have to re-stimulate the economy.

In addition, there was an incredible leap in bankruptcies in the years in which our now Prime Minister was Treasurer of this countryâ€”up 159 per cent compared with the Fraser-Howard years. The level of unemployment is the highest since the Great Depressionâ€”at 10.6 per cent. One could go on commenting about the record of this Government.

         The record we see here is one which, sadly, has affected the lives of many families in this country. People will not go through all the details of either of these packages but they will have a look at the credibility of the leadership of this country. When we look at that and measure up the record of our Prime Minister today, and when we look at some of the things he has said in the past, I am sure that people will have no doubt that they will elect a coalition government at the next election. Let us go back to some of our Prime Minister's notable quotes. In a speech on the 1988 Budget he said:
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        We are well on the way to prosperity.
       </para>
       <para>
        Perhaps the honourable member for Blaxland was well on the way to the Lodge at that stageâ€”I do not know. Maybe he was, but what about the rest of us? What about the other Australians out there, the one million unemployed, the young people out of work? Our Prime Minister also said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        We won't destroy business activity, we won't destroy employment. . .
       </para>
       <para>
        When was that? February 1990. Goodness gracious meâ€”two years ago! And what has happened in that time? About 300,000 people have been cast onto the scrap heap of unemployment. He said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        We won't destroy business activity . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        No, just another 15,000 or so small businesses went broke during that time. What an incredible statement. Why should Australians trust the honourable member for Blaxland when he made those statements in the recent past but has not delivered? There is no way in which the One Nation package will deliver long term benefits to this country. The Prime Minister said in March 1990:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        We won't let there be a recession.
       </para>
       <para>
        What have we had? The worst recession in 60 years in the meantime. In 1991 he said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I think a lot of the lay-offs are behind us. I think they laid them off last year . . .
       </para>
       <para>
        But what has happened in the meantime? Another 200,000 people are unemployed, out on the scrap heap. That is the record of this Government; that is the record of this Prime Minister. Over the next year the Australian people will be looking at the credibility of the Prime Minister and the record of the future Prime Minister of this country, the present Leader of the Opposition. There is no doubt what the Australian people will do when the next election comes around. They will abandon this approach to running Australia, the One Nation approach. It has been cobbled together in a few weeks in response to the Fightback package.

The cost of carrying out those works will be substantially lower because of the current flat state of the economy. Jobs will be generated by this investment in infrastructure, and works will be carried out at a substantial discount because of the keenness of competition.

That will lead to an improvement in productive capacity, the generation of jobs, and an improvement in our competitive position both at home and abroad, and it will lead to decisions by companies to go into new plant and equipment.

         I put it to the Minister at the table, the Minister for Land Transport (Mr Robert Brown), that when upgrading takes place on the Newcastle to Brisbane railway line, particular care be taken to ensure that where bridges are replaced, they not be replaced on existing alignments which carry the old speed constraints. It would be useless to be squandering money by replacing bridges that are long overdue for replacement without straightening out the tracks so that trains can run at high speed on those tracks. In looking at the rail improvements to be carried out between Brisbane and Melbourne and right through to Adelaide, ultimately we are looking at a much more sensible arrangement between rail, sea and road, where each form of transport will be performing the task to which it is most suited economically, socially and technically.

The Government is about bringing together the communities of this nation, bringing the markets and productive centres of each part of Australia closer together.

I will come to the goods and services tax a little later, but I want to state what this Government included in the package last week for small business. The package includes a substantial increase in capital gains tax relief for small and growing businesses, which will increase capital mobility and growth in that sector. There is a three-month extension to small business for 1991-92 company tax payments. There is no increase until 1994-95 in the prescribed minimum superannuation levy for businesses with payrolls of $500,000 or less. There is a tripling of the funding support to $12m for assisting small and medium enterprises into export markets through the export access program. Small business, like all businesses in this country, will benefit from the improved depreciation arrangements. They will enable many of them to carry out plant replacement and plant and equipment upgrades that they would not be doing without the assistance of the increased depreciation allowances.

But they do not have the expertise or the backing. The export access program allocation of $12m will mean that something like 700 small businesses will now be able to benefit under that program rather than the 250 that were able to benefit under the $4m that was available in that program. It will improve access to the program by businesses in all States and regions of Australia and will enable additional markets, particularly in Asia, to be targeted. That is about doing something positive for small business, not something that is destructive of small business, to which I will refer in a moment in respect of the goods and services tax.

I do not go to figures calculated by me or estimated by other politicians in this building; I go to the Taxation Commissioner's documents and his estimates of product consumed by a baker when it is assessing a baker's income tax return.

We would go from 71,000 tax gatherers under the current sales tax system to about two million tax gatherers. It is not just the people in small business who are involved; it is all the other people doing transactionsâ€”offices, trusts and all sorts of associations. Even the punters get caught. Lotteries, the TAB, the racing industry are all exempt from tax under the GST, which means everything they buy is subject to tax. That means that even the odds go down for the punters. Those opposite could not even let the punters alone; the punters are caught up in it. But for average small businesses the cost of GST collection is about an additional 2 per cent per annum to their expenditure. On a margin of net 3 per cent, 2 per cent is most of the profit.

         The Government's only weapon has been to attempt to cloud the issues at every step. The Prime Minister (Mr Keating) has resorted day after day to his old tools of tradeâ€”invective, abuse, sarcasm, misrepresentation. But it is interesting that the word that has come up in this debate very often tonightâ€”and I think this is the key wordâ€”is credibility. It seems that the focus is on the Prime Minister himself. It will be his credibility that will be tested at the next election. In fact, it will be tested sooner than that; it will be tested in the Wills by-election. People will not believe him. Why should they believe this man who has constantly and consistently misled the Australian people over the years that he was Treasurer? Nothing, I do not believe, will cloud that memory, for he stood in this place time after time and he went out into the electorate and misrepresented to the Australian people the extent of the problems that this country was facing. He lulled them into a false sense of security.

But the J-curve turned into a U-turn and we heard nothing about the J-curve. Then it was going to be the soft landing; it was just around the corner. For months and months it was going to be a soft landing and, `Oh, I won't let there be a recession. No, you can trust me. There won't be a recession while I am the Treasurer of this country.'

         Our fundamental criticism of the Prime Minister's One Nation statement has been that it is incredibly dangerous as a document; it is irresponsible and it is a desperate grab for votes. Of course, we have pointed out ad nauseam that it is unfunded, and in that sense we are saying, `Where is the money coming from?'. The Minister for Finance (Mr Dawkins) gleefully got up here one day and could hardly help himself explaining that if it were funded it would not be fiscal stimulus. It was really exciting for him to explain that little bit of economics to us. But the very point that we were making was that this fiscal stimulus at this time is very risky. In effect, in the short term there would probably be no effect at all, but the longer term effect is one of great risk. We could see the Australian economy plunge back into a boom-bust type cycle once again.

         There are, neverthelessâ€”and I am not going to damn the Prime Minister with faint praise hereâ€”some initiatives in this One Nation statement that we applaud. Needless to say, the initiatives that I am talking about are ones that have come out of the Fightback package. He has at least picked up some of our policies. I represent a tourist based area and some of the policies that the Government is talking about in the tourism and aviation industries are indeed welcome. I was quite impressed that, when the Prime Minister brought down his statement, he actually used the word tourism. He started talking about tourism. We had not heard that from the former Prime Minister. Of course, we have had a series of fairly  lacklustre tourism Ministers. But at least there was a recognitionâ€”and I applaud thatâ€”that the tourism industry actually exists. The Prime Minister describes the tourism industry in his statement as one of the economic stars of the 1990s. I certainly agree with that. The changes that he announced in his statement to amortisation rates on tourist income producing buildings are welcome and they will allow buildings to be written off over 25 years instead of 40 years.

         One of the criticisms of the tourism industry in recent times has been the extent of foreign ownership. That has certainly been an issue in my own electorate from time to time, although of course it is true that we would not have the hotels and resorts that we have without foreign investment. On balance, I am quite prepared to accept that there are positive benefits from that sort of investment. It has provided jobs and, of course, it goes on providing income for Australia.

         However, I believeâ€”and I think all honourable members would agreeâ€”that it is desirable that Australian companies and individuals are encouraged to invest in tourism. There has been a marked reluctance on behalf of Australians to do that. I think we have not taken a long enough term perspective on tourism as a profitable area for investment. Perhaps our banks and financial institutions are somewhat at fault there and some of the people and countries that have been prepared to invest here have taken that longer term perspective. The Japanese are particularly notable for that, being prepared to take the longer term outlook and to accept lower returns in the short term with a view to recouping their investment and getting a decent return on it in the longer term.

         As we find a recession around the world, we have now seen a marked downturn in foreign investment in this country and despite our best efforts to continue to attract that foreign investment, the extent of that downturn has become very marked.

         If we are going to see the tourism industry, to use the Prime Minister's words, as a `star' of the 1990s, we will have to provide infrastructure for the sort of tourists that we expect to attract to this country. The projections for tourism from overseas through to the end of the decade are very optimistic. If we are going to meet those projections, we have to have the infrastructure, the hotels and the tourist attractions in place for people to visit this country. Those accelerated amortisation rates and indeed the matching accelerated depreciation on other fixed assetsâ€”things that go in the hotelsâ€”are also welcome, with the increase in the rates for depreciation for those up to 20 per cent.

         As I said, the Prime Minister's statement picked up a lot of the Fightback package in respect of tourism and aviation. The latter is one area in which I believe the Opposition's policies have been well ahead of the Government's. We have consistently been in favour of the third runway at Sydney Airport. The Government has constantly dragged the chain on that; it has been the longest, most drawn out process one could imagine. However, the Opposition has been way ahead in all its policies, while the shadow Minister has been way ahead of any of his counterparts on the Government side in recognising the potential that tourism has for this country. It has taken a former Minister of this Government, the honourable John Brown, to do what the Government ought to have been doing, and that is promoting tourism and making people aware of the potential tourism has in this country. We were not getting that leadership from the Government for a long time. It was only the other night that I heard the Prime Minister, for the first time, say something about the tourism industry. I congratulate him for that; it is good to see that the Government is catching up here.

We could have otherwise had a one-airline policy, but history shows that we developed a two-airline policy; eventually that went by the board, as it should have, and then we had deregulation.

When I say `owned', I mean they have long term leases. Immediately prior to  airline deregulation right across the country, the Government gave long term leases on all the facilities to Australian Airlines and to Ansett and only gave the backdoor entry to newcomers. In other words, there were provisions in the leases that any incoming operator was to negotiate with one of the existing lessees. Of course that meant that any new operator was going to be very much disadvantaged.

The coalition has urged the provision of those for some time. We will go much further in respect of airport management. We will privatise airports. Coolangatta, my own home base, is an ideal prospect in terms of privatisation. It is one of the few Federal Airport Corporation airports that makes a profit, and I know that it would be a very attractive privatisation proposition for a local consortium.

         Australia, as are other Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development countries, is in a recession, which like booms and recoveries seem to be inevitable features of the business cycle. Downturns have occurred in the Australian economy every seven or eight years since the Second World War. The last twoâ€”in 1982-83 and in 1974-75â€”were greatly worsened by world recessions, while that of 1967 was diminished somewhat by the impact of the early Vietnam War boom.

         This recession has in part been the international response to the stock market collapse of 1987 when, in order to avoid a repeat of what occurred in 1929, Western governments aimed to maintain confidence by boosting liquidity. Of course the situation turned out to be quite different from that of 1929, and the countercyclical measures used actually became procyclical. This caused problems with our external account via an overheated economy and action needed to be taken to restrain economic activity. Our own recession was then further exacerbated by the rural crisis and the downturns in some of our key export markets, particularly Japan and North America.

It represents further progress in Labor's reform strategy of the internationalisation of the Australian economy and the maintenance of social compassion.

         The Opposition parties have also been looking at economic reform in the context of recession and last November released their own policy package, Fightback, which offers an alternative approach to Australia's predicament. I would like to say a few words about that. The centrepiece of the Opposition's package is the 15 per cent tax on all goods and services, which would raise about $18 billion net. That would be used to fund the abolition of payroll tax, petroleum excise and some customs duty which are paid now almost exclusively by business. The personal income tax cuts, biased heavily in favour of the well-off, will be funded by fiscal drag. This simply means that people pay more income tax as they go into higher tax brackets due to inflation, not due to higher real wages. These income tax cuts do not require a GST burden; they can be funded out of fiscal drag.

         The Opposition also proposes a significant reduction in Government services and spending of about $6 billion net, which would actually have to be a good deal more severe than that because the revenue shortfalls have already been identified and do not come out in the Opposition's package. Fightback is nothing more than a set of proposals to redistribute incomeâ€”and therefore wealthâ€”from the needy to the wealthy. It is all about setting a few policy mechanisms and then forgetting about the recession. It proposes no measures aimed at economic recovery.

         Indeed, the Commonwealth Treasury analysis released this week estimates that if Fightback were implemented the economy would not grow for some years to come, inflation would rise and overall as many as 70 per cent of Australians would be worse off.

         All this should not be very surprising, given the approach of the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) to economic policy. The Labor Party is quite happy to consult with and seek advice from those sectors of the community that actually run the economy: that is, business leaders, trade unions, the State governments, various statutory authorities and those who do or do not benefit from economic activity, such as the representatives of welfare recipients. Members of the Opposition, under the Leader of the Opposition, listen to no-one except the theoretical colleagues of the former professor from academia.

         Let me say that the process of government is not merely about setting macro-economic policy levers at the right setting. It is not about set and forget. Certainly, market signals must play a part, but within national, political and social objectives. Within this context, economic modelling is the preserve of the economic purist but is only one tool available to government. The Opposition, unfortunately, has made it an obsession.

         Labor's approach is altogether different. By the end of 1991 the Government had become aware of the likelihood that this particular cycle would see a fairly weak recovery mode. The Government took advice on what measures were needed to force the pace of growth, and decided on a level of stimulus in line with the recommendations it received from a wide ranging process of consultation during the early part of this year. It received various recommendations from business, unions, welfare representatives, corporations and State governments. The stimulus that was agreed on by almost universal consensus now amounts to $2.3 billion, compared with what is effectively a neutral package from the Opposition. After four consecutive Budget surpluses formulated during the boom of the late 1980s, a deficit is now appropriate to end the downturn in the cycle and to speed up the recovery phase.

         There are two principal advantages to the Government's package of measures. Firstly, the one-off social equity payment to families in receipt of family allowance, plus the permanent increase in family allowance supplement payments, provides a quick boost to confidence and expenditure at the cost of $300m. This is accompanied by an immediate reduction in sales tax and, therefore, the price of new motor vehicles. Secondly, all the other revenue and expenditure measures are designed not only to help stimulate economic activity but also to contribute to Labor's longer term goals of the reform of the micro-economic structure. The major measures include $1 billion for the upgrading of Australia's national infrastructure in order to boost the efficiency of our transport system, a restructuring of our electricity generating and supply grid, $750m dollars to expand and improve the TAFE educational system, and a new, more competitive, capital depreciation regime to reduce by half the write-off time for assets and to encourage investment in new technologies.

         Many of these measures are of particular benefit to regional economies such as that of South Australia. As a State with a larger manufacturing base than most, it is imperative that producers not be inhibited from investing in technologies that maximise productivity growth. The new depreciation rules will definitely advantage an economy such as that of South Australia. It is also imperative that we have efficient transport links to the rest of the country, and the standardisation of the Adelaide-Melbourne rail line will do this, as will the upgrading of the rail links to Port Adelaide and the expenditure of over $60m on highway improvements between Adelaide, Sydney and Brisbane.

         The reduction in the sales tax on new motor cars has already been of benefit to General Motors at Elizabeth and Mitsubishi at Tonsley Park, whose products fell by around $800 per unit. This reduction in sales tax and increased production will be of substantial benefit to the local automotive components industry. The multifunction polis at Gillman in Adelaide will also benefit from the contribution of $40m towards initial construction. The MFP is a key to saving Australia's future as an economy based around industries of the future and integrated into the Asia-Pacific region. But, before overseas companies can be expected to put their money into this project, the Australian public purse needs to show some commitment to the project, and this allocation of $40m dollars does just that.

         All this is in stark contrast to the Opposition's approach, which is largely passive. Labor is taking positive steps to kick-start and reform the economy. The Opposition, on the other hand, has placed a taboo on positive initiatives being taken by the Government. It appears that poor quality roads, decrepit railways and weak technical and vocational training can be fixed up by the imposition of a tax on cornflakes. It cannot. The rest of the community recognises that it cannot. There has been a hugely positive response to One Nation from wide sections of the community who were, of course, consulted during its formulation, including people such as business leader John Prescott from BHP and the former Liberal Party boss, John Elliott, as well as the media.

         On 2 April 1992, a one-off payment of between $125 and $250 will be provided to family allowance recipients. In addition, low income working families on family allowance supplement will receive a boost to their payment of $3 per child per week. A two-child family receiving family allowance supplement will be more than $400 better off over the coming year. Job Search and Newstart allowees and pensioners and beneficiaries with children will have their additional child payments increased by about the same amount.

Much of it will end up in the tills of local businesses, who will see what it means to get this economy going again, to kick-start it and to move it into the 1990s on a sound fiscal and economic growth basis.

That is his idea of `proactive'. Our idea of assistance to industry is to remove the level of taxation presently crushing our industries and our businesses.

Our rail freight is losing $5 billion a year. We never hear discussed that V/Line is losing $5m a day in Victoria. Moreover, the Fightback package will immediately boost business to the tune of the eradication of $20 billion. We can do all that, although none of us would be so foolhardy as to put a timetable on the benefits flowing back to the Australian people. But they do know that we will make an immediate start and, provided there is a change of attitude in conjunction with the fiat of a coalition government, I believe there is hope for this country and that unemployment can be reduced.

         Foreign debt cannot be easily erased and it is consuming up to 20 per cent of our monthly exports. We have a trading imbalance running to the tune of some $15 billion a year and interest repayments of 20 per cent on foreign debt. We have very grave problems. If there is one message that people need to grasp more than any about the Government's economic statement, it is this: the promises it makes are phoneyâ€”if not immediately, in the near futureâ€”because they are not funded. It is borrowed money.

         The Government is already in significant Budget deficit and this further spending on infrastructure and expansion of the public sector will only add $2.5 billion to the existing $5.5 billion Budget deficit.

         In drawing to a conclusion, I again wish to put before the House the benefits of the Fightback package, particularly as they affect my rural constituency of Gippsland. The farming community desperately needs some injection of incentive, as do all small and medium sized businesses, big business, individuals and families. That is what is missing from society and from business communities generally: incentiveâ€”incentive for businesses to reinvest and grow, and to create jobs and incentives for families to take responsibility, especially in the education and health fields. Quite frankly, there needs to be a significant reduction in the level of business input costs and the taxation levels on working men and women and their families.

         Until we bring about that low cost environment so that input costs are reduced across the board, we will not get an economic revival in this country. Leave aside all the economic jargon and the huge figures. As I said earlier, their impact is often lost. People have asked me, the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp), the honourable member for Mallee (Mr Peter Fisher) and other colleagues, `What hope is there for the future? Australia is gone. What can we possibly do to bring about change?' The answer is simple: lower the burden of taxation on business and individuals so as to bring down the level of input costs to provide incentive.

         The Fightback package has been widely received by the Australian electorate. We in the coalition do not rest on our laurels. We intend to go out and if we have to stand toe to toe with Government members and slug it out, we will do so because we know we have a blueprint for the future which outlines a vision of the Australia we want to bring about. We have won the confidence of the Australian people and we intend to retain that confidence and win the next election.

         â€”Mr Deputy Speaker, it saddens me that, despite many months of professional and detailed approaches to both the Federal and the State governments and appropriate Ministers and departments responsible for our health services, many hospitals and nursing homes are facing a crisis situation of major proportions. No wonder many Australians today are cynical of government. We know that the major problem that exists within our bush nursing hospitals relates to the classification of those hospitals, excluding them from public hospital arrangements under Medicare. Unfortunately, the shuffling of responsibilities and buck-passing between the States and the Federal Government is confusing any satisfactory resolution of the issues.

         Even worse, government policies and guidelines are continually changing, leaving these small groups of dedicated people extremely frustrated and almost beside themselves in trying to cope with the rapidity of such change. This Government, I remind the House, told us in 1983 that many smaller, acute hospitals throughout our electorates, particularly throughout rural Victoria, should build 10-bed nursing homes attached to their hospitals in order to ensure their viability.

         Through community generosity and raising of funds, despite some horrific economic circumstances over the years, committees met these government policies and right across the State they expanded a wonderful range of health services that met the needs of the community in our towns and within our own rural environments. However, probably due to the mismanagement of our economy and the lack of government funds to meet the earlier commitment, the rules were changed. Now government criteria for a 10-bed nursing home has been extended to 30 beds. In my region the endeavour to meet this requirement is both frustrated and restricted.

         We are told that the health region of Ballarat is oversupplied with nursing beds, but two-thirds of these beds are available in the city of Ballarat itself. It is accepted that many beds are not needed there and can be relinquished. The fact is that they have not been relinquished and there are no formal procedures to ensure that relinquishment takes place.

These nursing homes have to expand to 30 beds to be funded.

         I turn now to two particular examples which are causing me concern. The Birchip Bush Nursing Hospital has just received a letter indicating that special funding will cease for Birchip on 31 March next if redevelopment does not take place. The hospital advised the Minister and submitted a redevelopment plan on 29 November last year. In other words, the hospital has met its obligations and has met the Minister's obligations, but before the proposal it has submittedâ€”at the request of the Governmentâ€”has been looked at or determined, it has been given an ultimatum that top-up funding will cease.

         I speak for another hospital in my electorate, the Natimuk Bush Nursing Hospital. This hospital has accepted that it must meet the Government's criteria for a 30-bed nursing home. The hospital presently has a 22-bed nursing home and eight acute beds and is prepared to convert these acute beds and other auxiliary facilities to ensure a 30-bed nursing home is built. It is prepared to meet the Government's criteria and ensure that it not only meets the health needs of the community in an adequate way, but also that it meets the conditions required by the Government.

         Again, as I pointed out earlier, there is no commitment, no ability within the quota system, for nursing home beds to be transferred or to become available to meet this hospital's requirements. People living in isolated, remote communities have, through their own generosity and their own resources, contributed to the provision of health care and the wonderful range of services for the aged. It is totally unjustified and lacking in all social equity that these conditions should now be applied. Many of these facilities are new. They are modern facilities, equal to none in health care delivery and community caring.

        Surely the Minister will not shut down these facilities simply because of conflicting government policy.

They have written to me, and I am sure they have written to you also, Mr Deputy Speaker, to convey the objectives of this trust.
