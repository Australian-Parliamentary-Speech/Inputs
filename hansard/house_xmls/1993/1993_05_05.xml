       Effectively this motion gives Parliamentary Secretaries the authority of a Minister in operating in this chamber. It is a process that was tried in the last Parliament and found to be successful. It returns here because of doubts in the mind of the Clerk as to whether or not motions passed in the previous Parliament were sufficient to cover the operations of Parliamentary Secretaries in this Parliament. Therefore, the motion has now been framed in a fashion—and I am assured of this by the Clerk—which means that, until parliaments subsequently decide, these procedures will apply to the operations of Parliamentary Secretaries in the House.

        This has been part of a process of substantially augmenting the role of Parliamentary Secretaries. Mr Speaker, you were a beneficiary of that in the last Parliament. I have been delighted to note that the Opposition has taken a similar approach to the Parliamentary Secretaries on its side of the House. So I suspect that this process will have some longevity to it.

       This is a breach from what is desirable, made necessary by the fact that the appropriate committees to order private members business on Thursday are only just in place and have not had the opportunity to, in their normal fashion, collect the materials that would normally preoccupy us on a Thursday morning. I suspect that the section that is devoted to government business as a result of this motion will in all probability be the Address-in-Reply, so to all intents and purposes it will be close to the sort of morning that honourable members would expect on a private members day. Of course, it impacts neither on the grievance debate which will take place nor on members' statements.

The Opposition can move amendments to any particular set of propositions on sales taxes, but the Constitution requires them, unless this sort of proposition is put forward, to be voted on separately. As the honourable member for Bennelong (Mr Howard) would be well aware, if we actually voted on each sales tax measure separately, we would be here from now until kingdom come. We are considering them separately to conform to that constitutional requirement. If the Opposition wants to move amendments to particular parts of the sales tax legislation, those amendments will be voted on separately, but not the initial government propositions.

       Mr Speaker, I so move because we have a very abbreviated sitting period for Parliament at this time of the year. We have had an election and the formation of a new government as a result of that election, and we are not going to be in a position to have a normal run of sittings between now and when we normally rise for the winter break. In those circumstances, it is going to be necessary to sit the Parliament longer of an evening than we would normally do. The only comfort in that is that the period only lasts for a few weeks, as opposed to all year, so it should not unduly exhaust members and it will give a little bit more time for considering a fairly extensive legislation program.

        —The Opposition will not agree to this. We believe that the Parliament should be sitting on more days. The Opposition is utterly opposed to the arrogant, presidential manner in which this Parliament is being treated by the Government. It is an outrage that this Parliament is going to sit for only two weeks, and then presumably we will get up and come back later for the Budget session. I want to say to the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) that one of the things the coalition will be doing is endeavouring to ensure that the Parliament sits for a greater number of days, but during civilised hours on those greater number of days. What we should be doing is sitting for more days and not for a shorter number of days for longer hours.

        I can almost see the wheels ticking over in the Minister's mind. He is going to get up and say, `Well, this happened in the past' and quote some precedent that stretches back into the dim, dark recesses of the parliamentary experience. But whatever may have happened in the past, and as this is the first time we are saying something about the way we run our own business, I think there is an overwhelming view in the community—irrespective of whether people voted for the Government or for the coalition—that the job of parliamentarians is first and foremost to attend to their obligations as legislators. That means we ought to spend more time in the Parliament, but we ought to do so during civilised hours.

He has claimed that if the Government has 80 votes, it will want to use them. That has very little to do with this debate. This debate is all about the votes the Government is about to lose in the Senate. We know what the Government is up to. We have had an election.

        The simple fact is that this Government did not win the election on the representative votes of all Australians. The Government knows that. It has no chance of getting some of this legislation through after 30 June. It is practising a fraud on this Parliament by trying to keep people here until 2 o'clock or 3 o'clock in the morning, so that its retiring mates in the Senate can push through legislation which the Australian people have now elected other representatives to consider. It is wrong; it is wrong to be bringing people here at 3 or 4 o'clock in the morning.

Every year that the Government has been in power, weeks before the end of the session it comes up with about 50 or 60 Bills in this place. It makes a mockery of this place.

Let me pick up on a couple of pieces of that ranting lunacy and defend a few reputations around the place; firstly, the reputation of the Australian Electoral Commission. We established the commission independent of government, and many on our side of the House advised us at the time that that was a foolish thing to do—that we ought to have engaged in the sort of boundary rigging that had been representative of the performance of parliaments up to that time. After acting for a fairly lengthy period in opposition, we decided that we should make the electoral commissioner independent. As a result of having made the electoral commission independent we now get a fair distribution.

        What that fair distribution produces is an outcome that reflects the votes. Contrary to what the second half of the double act has had to say in the course of his remarks, the fact of the matter is that the Government was returned with a majority of votes—that is all there is to it. No-one can escape that fact. That happens to be the simple arithmetic—or, as Bob Menzies used to say, the simple English—of the outcome. That is something that the honourable member for O'Connor has to get used to.

        Of course we are not concerned about the numbers in the Senate in the context of this at all. The proposition that the honourable member puts forward is absurd. Unfortunately, at this time of the year, we have been virtually obliged to move this proposal for the entirety of the period in which we have been in office. For those of us who have been in opposition before—the number on this side of the House is becoming fewer and fewer as the length of service of the Government proceeds but, at the moment at least, it still includes me—this has been a regular experience. Indeed, as I recollect, this time of the year was not a bad time of the year for a suspension of the 11 o'clock rule. In opposition, the only really decent winter I can recall operating under the suspension of the 11 o'clock rule was one which coincided with the events of this winter—an Ashes tour of the United Kingdom. I can recollect sitting in the Caucus room until one, two, three in the morning waiting to come on to debate a piece of legislation in the House at 3.15, getting into the chamber and finding ourselves alone and sitting through, effectively, till breakfast.

When looking at the analysis the Liberals said, `By and large we had an excellent campaign but we had a problem with the old and bold in New South Wales'. One of the advantages of being the old and bold in New South Wales is that the honourable member can recollect exactly what went on in the period of time that he was in office, and he would recollect that Malcolm Fraser acted virtually permanently under the operation of the 11 o'clock rule.

        There is a difference. We do guillotine more legislation in government than was the case when those on the other side of the House were in government. They operated more extensively on the closure. If one goes back over the records one will find that we have definitely guillotined more legislation than they did, but one would also find that they have closed debate on legislation more frequently than we have. As they did not legislate as much as we do, their general method was to suspend the 11 o'clock rule and then, somewhere around 3 or 4 o'clock in the morning, move that the motion be put. At that stage the entirety of the Parliament was on its knees to whichever Minister was in the chamber, begging him to do precisely that. We obviate that by letting everyone know exactly when they are going to be voting and not simply moving at some point in time that the motion be put.

        I take on board what was said by the Opposition spokesmen on the requirement for more days of sitting. The schedule for the next session is set. I think when honourable members see that schedule they will see that there is a fairly extensive array of sittings in that period. Since going over to the pattern of two weeks on, two weeks off, it is not easy to schedule additional days. It was much easier when we had a three-week sitting, even though the hours are technically the same. Both sides of the House were in agreement when the former honourable member for Perth, Ric Charlesworth, brought in those reforms and we effectively sat seven days in a two-week block as opposed to nine days in a two-week block. That was seven days over two weeks as opposed to nine days in a month. Technically, we sit the same number of hours.

        In practical terms, it was always available to the Government to quite substantially increase the days of sittings when it had three weeks worth of sittings and it could extend three weeks by an extra day as opposed to two weeks effectively only by one extra day. We cannot really sit through the five days of the week. So, assuming four days of the week is acceptable, we have effectively obviated only the first week for a four-day sitting period.

        I go into this in some detail because I assume there is a degree of interest around the place. So far, very few people have expressed an objection to me about the two weeks on, two weeks off framework in providing a much more commonsense approach in our relationships with the electorate. Having decided to go on that course, it is very difficult for the Government to increase the days of sittings.

        The break between sittings is really only the winter months of June and July and we are back by the middle of August. At the end of the year, we rise effectively only a few days before Christmas, and we are back normally in mid-February. So one cannot say that the breaks in parliamentary terms are terribly excessive. The breaks are no different from what they have been historically. It is the ability to manipulate the timetable within that period that is the problem. But it is a problem that we have imposed upon ourselves. The procedures in this place will undoubtedly come under the review of the Standing Committee on Procedure, and I will take up those views with whoever is appointed as chairperson of that committee. I would suggest, too, that the Manager of Opposition Business ought to take up his concerns in that regard with the chairperson of that body as well.

        The Employment, Education and Training Act 1988 requires a review of the National Board of Employment, Education and Training, NBEET, and related bodies within five years of the commencement of the Act. The five-year period ends on 30 June 1993. As a consequence I gave consideration in the latter part of 1992 to the terms of reference for the review and the selection of a person to undertake it. However, at that time it was clear that an election was pending and that the policy statements of the coalition and the Government saw very different futures for NBEET. The coalition undertaking to abolish NBEET was of particular significance.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         Against that background, I decided that the review should be deferred so that the incoming government could determine the terms of reference in a way that would make the review forward looking rather than simply retrospective. The deferral also removed any possibility of the review becoming involved in the election process. It is clear that an adequate review cannot be established and carried to completion in the period currently prescribed by the Act. In these circumstances it is necessary to amend the Act to provide for the review to be carried out in six rather than five years. The Bill before the House amends the principal Act by extending the review period to 1 July 1994.

        The Great Barrier Reef is one of the world's greatest natural assets and was one of Australia's first World Heritage areas.

         The reef is critically important to Australian industries such as tourism and fishing. It supports a domestic and international tourism industry that contributes more than $1,000 million to our economy each year and a commercial fishing industry that contributes $300 million a year—both employ thousands of Australians. The Commonwealth and Queensland governments have invested significant resources in managing the reef, and industry has invested heavily in developments that rely for their sustainability on the integrity of the reef ecosystem.

         In the last five years, use of the marine park, especially for tourism, has been increasing at about 10 per cent per year. In spite of the recession, the Government has increased its appropriation for management of the park by an average of 2.9 per cent per year in real terms. Despite this increase, the funds available for environmental management of the Great Barrier Reef have not kept pace with the increasing level of use of the marine park.

         The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act 1975 to provide for the collection of charges imposed by the Great Barrier Reef (Environmental Management Charge—General) Bill 1993 and the Great Barrier Reef (Environmental Management Charge—Excise) Bill 1993. The introduction of environmental management charges on commercial users will help offset increasing demands placed on management of the marine park.

         The Keating Government is committed to the underlying principle of this Bill—that a commercial operator using a community asset for profit should contribute to the cost of its management and conservation. We have applied the user-pays principle in Commonwealth-managed fisheries since the mid-1980s, and we intend to apply the same concept to the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. Since commercial operators using the marine park are dependent on the reef as their principal resource it is fair that they contribute financially to the management of this priceless resource and the research necessary to ensure its survival.

         Under present arrangements, commercial activities including tourist operations, infrastructure construction, and mariculture require permits from the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority. In 1988, the Great Barrier Reef Ministerial Council, on which the Commonwealth and Queensland governments are represented, approved a study of the feasibility of an environmental management charge scheme. Extensive consultations have been conducted with the commercial operators who have held permits to operate in the marine park since that time. Operators have acknowledged that management of the marine park, including relevant research, is essential to the continued viability of their industries. The proposed charges are in accordance with views of most of the operators affected by the Bill. Details of the charging scheme will be dealt with by regulations. Following representation by operators, I have agreed to exempt all direct transfers between parts of Queensland, such as between Queensland islands and the mainland, when operators are merely transiting the marine park.

         A significant advantage for the industry in this scheme is that transferability of permits under specified conditions will be possible, enabling improved flexibility in commercial decision making. The charges on commercial tourism operators included in the regulations that I intend to submit to the Executive Council for approval are equivalent to only about $1 per person per day for most tourist operations—this is less than one per cent of the price of a ticket for a day trip to the outer Great Barrier Reef.

         This legislation package imposes charges on those commercial operations in the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park which presently need a permit from the authority. Activities which do not currently require a permit—for example, private recreational activities like boating and general access to beach and reef areas—will not be subject to environmental management charges. Commercial fishermen other than those engaged in aquaculture will not be subject to the charges. They do not require permits from the authority and already pay substantial charges to fisheries management agencies for managing that resource.

         This Bill to amend the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act 1975 is being introduced with two separate environmental management charge Bills to comply with section 55 of the Constitution relating to tax legislation. The details for implementation of the charges, such as the fixing of the amount to be charged, and specifying the activities to be covered by the charges, will be determined by regulations under the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Act, which are subject to tabling in both Houses.

         To provide an opportunity for the continuing participation of groups that will be affected by the charges, this Bill extends the function of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Consultative Committee to include the provision of advice to the Minister in respect of the charging scheme. The revenue collected through the imposition of the charges will be used by the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority for research, education and other aspects of environmental management. It will enhance the knowledge base and community understanding of the reef and contribute directly and indirectly towards better management and environmental protection both by the authority and by day-to-day users. Commercial operators will benefit by ensuring the continued conservation of the Great Barrier Reef, the resource on which their activities depend.

         It is estimated that the introduction of the charges will raise approximately $1 million per year at the present levels of commercial use. If the Bill is enacted during these sittings—and I hope it will be—the charges will be introduced on 1 July this year. The cost of collecting the charges, which will be drawn from revenue raised, will be about 10 per cent of the amount collected. The Government will continue to fund the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority through Budget appropriations, in line with present practice. The environmental management charges will contribute to offsetting the additional costs of the increasing commercial use of the marine park.

        The purpose of the Dairy Produce Amendment Bill 1993 is to introduce amendments to the Dairy Produce Act 1986. The amendments will provide greater commercial flexibility to the Australian Dairy Corporation, allowing it to save on costs and to implement a risk management program enhanced by specific reference to its capacity to undertake hedging operations through banks.

         The dairy industry is an important and strong sector in the Australian economy. Its recent performance has been very encouraging. Milk production has been increasing for the last decade and production this year of 7,200 million litres is expected to be similar to the peak of the early 1970s.

         Honourable members will be aware that this Government has been working closely with the dairy industry to improve the competitiveness, efficiency and profitability of the industry. We have worked to broaden its focus towards an export market, adopt best international business practices, improve industry integration and provide well targeted research and development. I believe the industry has made some commendable improvements and I expect it will continue to adapt, compete successfully and bring much needed export earnings to Australia. The industry should be proud that its export earnings in 1992-93 are forecast to be over $1 billion for the first time. This is a rise of about 32 per cent from the previous year.

         Supporting the industry's pursuit of market expansion and development has been substantial technical improvement in dairy production and manufacturing. Dairy farmers are realising the benefits of these changes and, unlike many other rural industries, have a relatively sound financial outlook. The most recent ABARE survey indicates a healthy average farm cash income of $51,000 for 1992-93.

         To further encourage progress and development in the Australian industry I introduced a new dairy plan from 1 July 1992. The plan set the direction for the industry until the year 2000. A key element of the approach was the establishment of the Dairy Marketing Review Task Force. The task force has been charged with the responsibility of developing an industry driven strategy aimed at redirecting the industry's effort to further enhance the export marketing and development of dairy products.

The task force has consulted widely with the dairy manufacturers and exporters to ensure that the review recommendations will be realistic and achievable. I am confident that the task force will identify a forward looking and progressive marketing strategy, giving due consideration to the structure of the industry, which will lead it through the remainder of this decade and into the next century. When the review is completed, I will evaluate its recommendations carefully. I can assure this House that the Government, in close consultation with industry, will make use of the review's findings and continue to guide the dairy industry towards improved marketing capacity, profitability and long-term growth.

         As I have said, the primary purpose of these amendments is to improve the corporation's financial operations in relation to banking and foreign exchange.

         The amendments specifically empower the corporation to undertake futures dealings with banks. The corporation's futures trading will be limited to hedging.

The amendments will remove uncertainty concerning the ability of the corporation to secure exchange rates and cover the financial risks involved in international trade. Of prime importance in this area is the trade in cheese to Japan. This is a market in which Australian product has been performing very well. This trade is expected to amount to over $100 million this financial year.

        The proposed amendments to the Australian Wool Realisation Commission Act 1991 will provide for a one-year extension of the repayment period for the wool industry debt. That debt currently stands at $2.26 billion and is backed by a government guarantee.

         The Government's recently announced package of measures, of which this amendment forms part, is in response to the deteriorating conditions in the wool industry. We have experienced reduced demand for our wool due to the continuing global recession affecting our key markets in western Europe and Japan and the virtual withdrawal of Russia from the market. In combination with this, we are faced with continuing overproduction, a $3.9 million bale stockpile and wool prices which are at their lowest level in real terms in over 40 years. The key elements of the recent package provide immediate relief from the short-term circumstances facing the industry and set in train a process to address the more fundamental issues in the longer term.

         The Australian Wool Realisation Commission is charged with the responsibility of managing the stockpile and discharging the industry's debt which was accumulated under the former wool reserve price scheme. It is to undertake this in a manner that is in the best interests of the nation and woolgrowers in particular. The legislation currently requires the Commission to acquit the debt within seven years or less. The commission ceases to exist upon the sale or transfer of all assets and repayment of the debt.

         This amendment will now give the commission eight years, from 1 July 1991, in which to repay the debt and the government guarantee will also be extended by one year. In current circumstances it was apparent that the commission could not retire the debt within the requirements of its current schedule, without an adverse impact on an already deteriorating wool market. The Commission was not in a position to sell significant quantities of its stocks without further depressing the market. At the same time the Government agreed that woolgrowers could not afford increased tax payments to maintain the debt repayment schedule.

Under the changed guidelines, the commission will not be required to repay debt in 1993-94 beyond the $118 million funds already in hand for this purpose. This should entirely remove any speculative element that might exist in the market that the Commission will be required to make forced sales.

        The purpose of this Bill is to extend to the three public mobile carriers the benefit of land access powers. The general carriers, Telstra Corporation Ltd—formerly AOTC—and Optus Networks Pty Ltd—a subsidiary of Optus Communications Pty Ltd—have certain powers under the Telecommunications Act 1991 to enter privately owned land in order to inspect, evaluate and install or construct telecommunications facilities for the provision of general telecommunications services.

         In the international battle against poverty, the World Bank is one of the most powerful players. It is the largest and the most global of all international development institutions, operating in all sectors and all regions. The International Development Association, to which this Bill authorises a $350 million Australian contribution, is that part of the World Bank with the strongest direct focus on poverty reduction. It provides highly concessional loans for development activities in most of the world's poorest countries—those with annual per capita incomes of less than $US740. IDA loans usually involve 10 year grace periods, 35 or 40 year maturities, and no interest charges. They are also accompanied by training and technical advice.

Australia's $350 million contribution to IDA-10 represents a share of 1.46 per cent, a decline in real terms on our contribution to IDA-9.

        This Bill proposes certain amendments to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission—commonly referred to as ATSIC—and to the structure of regional councils that were established under the original Act. In essence the changes provide for:

        When ATSIC came into being, a little over three years ago, it was the culmination of a long process of debate in the Parliament and of consultation with the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. Here were bold and innovative proposals indeed. The central responsibility for the Commonwealth's activities for Australia's indigenous peoples was to be assumed by a commission comprising entirely Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, most of whom were to be elected. Gone would be the days where key decisions affecting the lives of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people would be taken by a Minister and his officials. To strengthen the transformation from dependence to empowerment, a structure of 60 elected regional councils was to be created, providing a real measure of local autonomy and choice.

         Nothing like this had been tried before, in Australia or overseas. It represented a unique experiment in public administration. There were many who doubted whether it could work. Their fears, I am delighted to say, have been unfounded. ATSIC has established itself as an authentic and respected national voice for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people, and a responsive and responsible administrator of government programs. It has been firm both in the independence of the advice it has provided and in the standards of accountability it has set for the programs it delivers.

         The confidence we have in the commission has been confirmed by entrusting it with a substantial increase in its responsibilities, both through the new and augmented programs arising from the response of governments to the report of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody and through the transfer to it of programs previously operated by other Commonwealth agencies. In 1992-93, its program budget is one-third higher than for the previous year.

         The responsibilities of regional councils have been progressively increased. They now make more of the decisions about how funds are to be distributed and play an increasingly active role in the whole range of activities and policies that will affect the lives of their peoples. In State and Territory governments, there is growing recognition of the role of ATSIC and of the desirability of coordinating their activities for the benefit of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people with ATSIC's structures and programs. Most pleasing of all, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs have now become matters enjoying a high measure of cross-party support.

         It is against this background that the changes proposed in the Bill are being put before the Parliament. The changes are based on the Government's commitment to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander self-determination and our confidence in indigenous people managing their own affairs. They are fundamentally about shifting greater decision-making power to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples themselves. They are also directly in line with the thrust of the report of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody.

         An important provision of the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Act 1989 was that, before the end of the term of the first elected commissioners, the commission should review and report to the Minister on the operation of the Act. Section 26 of the Act provides that the review should deal with: any problems that may have been caused by conflicts between the representative responsibility of commissioners and their responsibility as members of a body with executive responsibilities; the operation of the electoral system established by the Act; and any other matter relating to the operation of the Act.

Additional proposals for changes to the Act will be put before the Parliament at a later stage. I would like to stress again that none of the proposals I am putting before the Parliament today were considered by the Government without the support of the commissioners of ATSIC.

         Recommendation 11 of the commission's report dealt with `Regional Councils—numbers, functions and powers', and proposed that: the numbers of regional councils be reduced; the powers of regional councils be increased; greater administrative support be provided to regional councils; and regional council chairpersons be appointed on a full-time basis. This recommendation has a particular urgency because the Act presently requires that regional council elections be held before the end of this year.

         The Bill proposes a reduction in the number of regional councils from 60 to 36. In considering the reductions to be made in the number of regional councils, the commissioners of ATSIC and the Government took into account the following factors: the desirability, where practicable, of amalgamating councils with small Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander populations; the need to avoid merging non-urban councils with metropolitan councils with large Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander populations, which would lead to the prospect of city domination; minimising other boundary changes; greater administrative support for councils with most ATSIC regional offices now to serve a single council; and improved administrative efficiency.

The Minister will no longer have the power to choose the chairperson and two other commissioners, and there will be a consequential reduction in the number of commissioners from 20 to 17. The chairperson will now be elected by commissioners, and will hold that office for the term of the commission.

         The third major aspect of the Bill is to allow for the appointment of commissioners and regional council chairpersons on a full-time basis. At present, only the commission chairperson is a full-time appointment. The change to full-time appointments, as recommended in the review report, recognises that responsibilities of commissioners and regional council chairpersons have proved to be far greater than was foreseen when ATSIC was created. Increasingly they are finding that the demands of their positions are such as to make it difficult for them to sustain outside employment. This reflects how rapidly ATSIC and the regional councils have come to be accepted as the central organs of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander affairs, and the increased responsibilities that have flowed from such factors as the response of governments to the report of the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody.

         Over the next two months ATSIC is organising a series of workshops of commissioners and regional council chairpersons to discuss implementation of the changes that are included in this Bill, and also the various other reforms proposed in the commission's report. One important matter to be discussed in these consultations will be the option of introducing, if possible for the 1993 elections, a ward system for regional council elections. Such a system would provide an assured level of representation for each significant area of a region. I would like to stress that a crucial element of the strategy of the commissioners which is supported by the Government is the devolution of greater decision-making powers and responsibilities to the regional councils.

        The Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Amendment Bill 1993 reflects the commitment of this Government to ensuring that traditional Aboriginal owners will be able to enjoy security of title over their traditional lands to the fullest extent practicable. The Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 provides a mechanism whereby traditional Aboriginal land in the Northern Territory referred to in schedule 1 of the Act may be granted to Aboriginal land trusts to hold title on behalf of Aboriginal people. Since the Act came into operation in 1977 a total of 54 separate parcels of land have been scheduled under the Act.

        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         This Bill would schedule a further three areas of traditional land under the Act known as Catfish Dreaming, Eva Valley Station and Kanturrpa-Kanttaji. The scheduling of the areas known as Catfish Dreaming and Eva Valley arises from an agreement—facilitated by the Commonwealth Government—between an association of Aboriginal traditional owners known as the Jawoyn Association, the Northern Territory Government and the mining company, Zapopan NL. Under this agreement Zapopan will be allowed to proceed with the important gold mining venture at Mount Todd. The Jawoyn Association has agreed not to pursue any claim for native title or support any such claim by any other person in respect of the mineral leases involved and has also agreed to give Zapopan unrestricted rights of access to the land whilst undertaking to support ongoing exploration activity by the company. Zapopan has also agreed to provide employment and training for Aboriginal people at the mining site. As part of this settlement the Commonwealth Government has agreed to amend the Act to schedule two parcels of land.

         The scheduling of the third area known as Kanturrpa-Kanttaji arises from a settlement reached between the Northern Territory Government, the Northern Territory Power and Water Authority and the Central Land Council, representing the claimants in the Kanturrpa-Kanttaji land claim. Essentially, that settlement secures for the Northern Territory the current and future water supply for Tennant Creek, in return for its support for the scheduling of the land. This is to be achieved by the granting of a licence allowing the Northern Territory Power and Water Authority the right to continue its borefield operations in the Tennant Creek area and by the granting of a lease to secure access to present and future borefields on that and adjacent Aboriginal land.

        This Bill makes some minor amendments to the Australian National Training Authority Act 1992 in relation to staffing of the authority. The Australian National Training Authority was established formally in December 1992 following an agreement between heads of government in July of that year. The authority is developing its organisational structure and engaging staff progressively during 1993, leading to full implementation of the new national vocational education and training system from the beginning of 1994.

         As a truly national body, the authority should be able to draw its staff from a wide range of sources in both the public and private sectors, during its establishment period and on an ongoing basis. The existing provisions of the Act already provide a good deal of flexibility in staffing arrangements. However, it now appears that the existing provisions are not sufficiently flexible in two small, but important, respects.

         The first relates to the authority's chief executive officer. The authority has recently conducted an exhaustive public recruitment campaign for its first chief executive officer. During this process, it became apparent that a capacity for the authority to arrange for secondment of a chief executive officer would enhance its ability to engage suitable people from the public sector.

         The Act currently provides for the authority to appoint a chief executive officer but makes no mention of appointment by way of secondment, although there is provision for secondment of other staff.

         On this basis the authority asked the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Beazley), in his capacity as chairperson of the Commonwealth-State ministerial council to which the authority reports, to seek the council's agreement to introduction of an amendment to the Act to make such an explicit provision. The council agreed to this proposal at its meeting on 23 April and also endorsed the authority's selection of a senior Victorian public servant, Mr Terry Moran, to be its inaugural chief executive officer. The authority proposes to second Mr Moran using the new provisions should they be enacted.

         Clause 3 of the Bill would make explicit provision to permit the authority to appoint a chief executive officer by way of a secondment from the Commonwealth, a State or Territory or from an authority of the Commonwealth, a State or Territory. It is common practice for a person to retain similar salary and other entitlements as apply to his or her `home' position while on secondment. For this reason, the Bill provides that a seconded chief executive officer would not be subject to the provisions of the Act dealing with the setting of remuneration and other matters by the Remuneration Tribunal or the ministerial council.

         The financial impact of this provision would depend on the terms of an individual secondment arrangement. The cost to the authority, and therefore to the Commonwealth which provides the authority's operating funds, could be higher or lower than that which would otherwise apply. Any additional cost would be expected to be only a very small component of the authority's total operating budget.

         A secondment from the Australian Public Service or a Commonwealth authority would be under the usual arrangements for secondments to a Commonwealth statutory authority.

The council could, if it wished, lay down guidelines for such arrangements.

         I turn now to the second aspect of the amendments which deals with a possible limitation in the existing provisions of the Act for secondment of staff other than the chief executive officer. There is some doubt whether those provisions, as currently worded, would enable the authority to make secondment arrangements with State and Territory authorities including, for example statutory authorities with responsibilities in vocational education and training. Clause 4 of the Bill would remove any such doubt by providing explicitly for these secondments.

         In general, employees accrue leave entitlements based only on the period of employment with their current employer. However, in some industries, such as the waterfront industry, employees are likely to change employers so often that they could never take leave, but rather would be paid out the value of leave entitlements each time they transfer to a different employer. In those industries, leave entitlements under the terms of an industrial agreement or award may be based on total service with a number of employers. Accordingly, employers may be required, or may as a matter of commercial reality decide, to pay one another on account of a transferring employee's accrued leave entitlements.

Consequently, if a payment in respect of an employee's accrued leave entitlements is made by one employer to another upon the transfer of the employee, no tax deduction is available to the employer who makes the payment.

        Mr Deputy Speaker, the Taxation Laws Amendment (Superannuation) Act 1992 implemented many of the measures outlined in the Treasurer's

Those measures introduce changes to both the voluntary and compulsory tiers of the Government's superannuation policies—changes which are designed to make the Government's policies fairer, simpler and more efficient. This Bill, which is largely the same as Taxation Laws Amendment (Superannuation) Bill (No. 2) 1992, will introduce two of the remaining measures outlined in that statement: the treatment of death benefits and excessive components.

         The Bill introduces amendments to assess lump sum superannuation benefits received by a person, on the death of another person, against the deceased person's reasonable benefit limits, RBLs.

        On Saturday, 13 March 1993, the Australian people clearly indicated that they shared the Government's belief that this nation must advance together. By advancing together, not only will we build a strong economy, but a fairer society that pays particular attention to the special needs of groups such as the aged and the unemployed.

         The cornerstone of the Government's retirement incomes policy is, and remains, an adequate age pension for those most in need. But that does not mean that we cannot do more. First, the Government recently extended full Commonwealth fringe benefits to all pensioners and older long-term allowees and agreed to compensate the States in 1992-93 for the cost of extending verified State concessions to this group. We have also introduced the superannuation guarantee charge to improve access to higher private income in retirement.

          Building on strength

         that it would improve the position of low income retirees by easing the pensions assets test. The Government recognised that although some retirees have suffered from a reduction in their nominal income due to recent falls in interest rates that would entitle them, under the income test, to either a pension or a higher rate of pension, they would still not receive this because of their relatively high level of assets and the effect of the pension assets withdrawal rate. The Social Security Amendment Bill 1993 gives effect to this initiative.

         From 20 September 1993, the pensions assets test set out in the Social Security Act 1991 will be adjusted so that if a person has assets in excess of the assets test threshold applicable to them, the person's pension will be reduced by $19.50 rather than $26 for every $250 above the threshold. This means that many retirees will either get more pension or qualify for a pension for the first time.

         the Government noted that many people seeking full-time work are currently holding part-time jobs that continued to grow during the recession. An increasing proportion of jobsearch allowance and newstart allowance recipients are reporting income from casual and part-time work. The Government indicated its support for this trend given that as well as providing an additional source of income, such employment assists job seekers to maintain their skills and their informal network of contacts that can be so important in finding a full-time job. To further encourage the trend the Government announced a range of measures that would both improve the financial return from undertaking part-time or casual employment and reduce client uncertainty about the effects of such employment on future entitlements.

The first of these relates to Cambodia. The Veterans' Entitlements Act was amended in 1992 to designate Cambodia as an operational area. This allowed for the extension of benefits under the Act to members of the Australian Defence Force serving with United Nations forces as part of the peacekeeping efforts in Cambodia.

         Advice has recently been received by the Government from the Chief of the Defence Force that some members of the Australian Defence Force have been engaged in United Nations operations across the Cambodian border in Laos and Thailand. Accordingly, the Government has decided to amend schedule 2 to the Act to extend the operational area of Cambodia to include areas in Laos and Thailand that are not more than 50 kilometres from the border with Cambodia. This amendment takes effect from 20 October 1991, the same date that Cambodia was declared an operational area. It will ensure that any Australian Defence Force personnel who cross the Cambodian border into either Laos or Thailand, will continue to be covered for benefits under the Act in respect of that service.

         The second change arises from the Government's decision to extend benefits under the Act to members of the small Australian Defence Force contingent serving with the United Nations peacekeeping forces in the former Yugoslavia. In view of the significant additional risks associated with such service, the Bill proposes that the area comprising the former Yugoslavia be designated as an `operational area'. This change will take effect on and from 12 January 1992, that being the first date on which Australian Defence Force personnel commenced serving in the area.

         The third change is an amendment to give effect to the Government's decision, announced in December last year, to provide benefits under the Veterans' Entitlements Act to members of the Australian Defence Force serving with the United Nations in Somalia as part of Australia's contribution to Operation Restore Hope and the United Nations Operation Somalia. This amendment will take effect from 20 October 1992.

         The effect of declaring both the former Yugoslavia and Somalia as operational areas is that it will allow for any claims for disability pension, due to injury or death in respect of such service, to be determined on the more generous standard of proof provisions in the Veterans' Entitlements Act.
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          Service in each of these areas is also to be regarded as `qualifying service'. This will allow access to service pension provided the other conditions relating to age, income and assets are also met. The Bill proposes the necessary amendments to give effect to this decision. It also contains some minor consequential amendments to the Income Tax Assessment Act and the Public Service Act to ensure that they recognise the newly proposed operational areas for the purposes of the benefits available under those Acts.

         Complex legislative and administrative problems arise on each occasion Australia is asked to contribute to international peacekeeping obligations. It is in no small measure due to the linking of the portfolio responsibilities of Veterans' Affairs and Defence Science and Personnel that each of these legislative changes can be implemented so soon after the Government has announced its commitment, or in the case of Cambodia, after the Government considered the need for change in the light of new circumstances. The changes underline the importance the Government attaches to the continuing welfare of veterans and their families.

        This Bill proposes amendments to the Excise Tariff Act 1921 to decrease the excise duty payable on gasoline for use in aircraft, or avgas, and to increase the excise duty payable on tobacco and tobacco products.

         The proposed decreases in avgas occur in two stages. The first is effective from 7 May 1992 and the second decrease is effective from 19 August 1992. The decreases result from two sources. The first is from the Government's policy of transferring Commonwealth owned aerodromes to full local ownership and encouraging aerodrome owners who are receiving funding under the aerodrome local ownership plan to accept full financial responsibility for their aerodromes. The second is from a reduction in Civil Aviation Authority costs.

         The resulting reduction in funding is then passed on to the aviation industry in the form of decreases in the rate of excise duty to be paid on the avgas. This Bill proposes a total decrease of 2.1c per litre. A decrease of 2c per litre is attributable to the aerodrome cost recovery program. The other 0.1c per litre is attributable to the CAA achieving cost savings in the provision of its rescue and firefighting services. These cost savings result in a corresponding reduction in the proportion of excise duty used to fund that service.

         The proposed increase in excise duty on tobacco products amounts to $5 per kilogram. The Government is concerned about the social costs of smoking. However, it realises a balance must be struck with this concern and placing an unfair burden on tobacco users which may also have an undesirable inflationary impact. The Government considers that the proposed increase is a responsible measure which adequately satisfies this balance.

         Both the decrease in the duty payable on avgas and the increase in duty payable on tobacco took effect last year pursuant to excise tariff proposals Nos 1 and 2 of 1992. These proposals lapsed upon the dissolution of the House on 8 February this year and then their effect was reinstated by excise tariff proposal No. 1 of 1993. Notwithstanding their lapsing, duty collections continued at the rates specified in the proposals and therefore this Bill proposes to validate those collections as well as incorporating excise tariff proposal No. 1 of 1993 into the Excise Tariff Act 1921.

         The reduction of 2c per litre in respect of the Department of Transport and Communication's aerodrome cost recovery program will result in a reduction of revenue in the order of $1.8 million in 1992-93 and $2 million in 1993-94. The decrease of 0.1c per litre requested by the Civil Aviation Authority is balanced by the reductions in moneys appropriated to it, so therefore there will be no net financial impact.

         The Government policy was to go into a price based system that would determine the best possible outcome for the people of Australia. In previous instances when these types of licences have been determined we have had what has been commonly referred to as a beauty contest.

         The Government is very committed to achieving the best possible outcome for pay TV licences in this country. The Government policy will, I think, return to the people of Australia a very large and substantial fee for the pay TV licences. In fact, that is the process that was gone through. It is not correct when the Leader of the Opposition says there is no check and balance in the system. What will happen, of course, is that these licence tenders—they are only tenders; nobody has yet been issued with a pay TV licence—will be referred to the Australian Broadcasting Authority which will make the determination under the Act.

He is making an assumption that those two companies cannot fulfil the obligation. There is a process. The Leader of the Opposition can do economic damage to those companies.

We have said that this process will now flow through. The two bidders that have bid for licences will actually go through the full process. If, for any reason, either or both of these two bidders do not come up with the appropriate amount of money, which is payment in full within 30 days of the advice of the Australian Broadcasting Authority, then the next highest tenderer will be put into the assessment process. Under the legislation we are introducing, what would then happen is that the next highest tenderer would be required to put up five per cent deposit.

So, as a first step, we are reviewing all labour market programs to ensure that funds are directed in ways in which they are most effective at getting people jobs. Our labour market programs are now in some way contacting about 450,000 to 500,000 people a year. Our experience of the programs is that, if people are trained and given a job opportunity, their prospects for maintaining themselves in work are very greatly enhanced.

We will receive from this process a much higher amount of money for the pay TV licences than we would have received. The honourable member for Goldstein makes an assumption that the people who have bid for these licences do not have the financial capacity to do so. I do not know the basis on which he makes that assumption. They have bid for those licences. The assumption that he makes denies these applicants due process. If he wants to do that, it is up to him; it is not something that the Government will do. Due process is to be followed.

         —I thank the honourable member for his question. I have just returned today from meetings of the World Bank, the IMF and the Asian Development Bank. Just before the meeting of the IMF, there was a meeting of the G7, the seven largest industrialised economies, and they produced a communique which, of course, helped to inform the discussions of the interim committee of the IMF.

         I think the important feature of that communique is that the G7 finance Ministers identified the key problem for the industrialised world as ensuring that there was sufficient growth to restore strength to their economies and, most particularly, to provide jobs for the large number of people who remain unemployed in many of those economies, particularly the European economies. The G7 Ministers noted the action that had been taken by their various economies. In North America there was emphasis on the efforts that are being taken by the United States and Canada to restore their fiscal position and to deal with the fiscal deficits which have grown up in both those economies during the 1980s, and also on the action which is intended to be taken by both governments to reverse that trend.

         In Japan, there was a noting of the very welcome action taken by the Japanese Government to stimulate that economy through a collection of both expenditure and tax measures designed to bring on a recovery within the Japanese economy which will have significant consequences for the world economy. In Europe, there was a noting that the situation there is both varied but generally weak with the situation in Germany much worse than people anticipated and the German Minister, Mr Waigel, noting that perhaps the worst was yet to come as far as Germany was concerned. There was a noting of the decision of the European Community to embrace the European growth initiative, which it agreed to at its most recent meeting in Edinburgh.

         I would have thought that promoting Australian wine, particularly from a South Australian, would have been a welcome initiative, not one to make fun of. Bearing in mind that this incident took place some six to eight years ago and was still fresh in Secretary Bentsen's mind, that does indicate the impression that presumably the quality of the wine made on him—not only that but the quality no doubt of the discussion I had with him at the time. Secretary Bentsen made it very clear that the United States was committed to doing whatever it could to bring about a resolution of these discussions and looked forward to progress at the Tokyo summit, in the hope that these negotiations could be settled by the end of the year.

         I think the important resonance coming out of the G7 communique for Australia was that the areas identified there were precisely the areas which we ourselves have identified as key issues for Australia, particularly the implementation of a medium-term strategy for a consolidation of the Budget in Australia, the containment of labour costs and the improvement of competitiveness generally and measures designed to improve domestic savings. Also, there was an emphasis on the need to promote investment in both physical capital and human capital, and there was a need to address the economic effects of an ageing population. These are all issues which are quite clearly on the agenda of this Government and are important to this nation, and it is clear that Australia's policy development is very much in tune with what is happening in the rest of the world.

         However, I was gratified to receive so many complimentary remarks about how well the Australian economy was going relative to the others. An important point for those opposite to recognise is that, although we would like the Australian economy to be growing faster, the IMF, in its world economic outlook, suggests that there will be very few economies which will be growing even between two and three per cent during 1993.

         Australia will be one of the few that will be doing so, and it is our objective to ensure that the benefits of that growth can be sustained, that the low inflation that we have achieved can be sustained and therefore that the benefits of that low inflation sustainable growth can be shared by more people in Australia and can particularly be directed towards helping those people who are unemployed.

It goes without saying that the wool industry is in very difficult circumstances at the moment. That comes about because of low prices occasioned by the recession in Western economies, the fact that Russia is not back in the market and the oversupply that is in the system. Of course, all of this has been compounded in parts of Queensland and New South Wales by the drought.

         In response to this, the Government last week acted decisively in announcing a package of assistance which included financial assistance to those farmers affected. The package of assistance includes a $50 million additional commitment by the Commonwealth under the rural adjustment scheme which, if fully matched by the States, will draw another $22 million for assistance under the exceptional circumstance provisions. This is on top of $320 million which the Commonwealth has already committed since July of 1991 to assist the rural sector and this amount is currently underpinning in excess of $2.3 billion in farm debt.

         The other dimension of the package was to take the speculative pressure off the stockpile. I think the early indications are that that has begun to work.

         As for the honourable member's question as to how this has been received, it has been received extremely well by the various farm organisations. The NFF has welcomed it, as have the New South Wales Farmers Federation, the Victorian Farmers Federation and, in the case of the grains section and drought in Queensland, the Queensland grain growers. The major press comment has been very favourable, indicating in the main that it is a responsible package, and the industry is getting much needed assistance.

         The other indication of a negative response came from the honourable member for Gwydir, whom I welcome to his new position and congratulate on having attained the deputy leadership in his party, but I say to him that I really think that he has to do a bit better than come out with negative reactions which are not shared by the farm organisations, who have welcomed what has been done. He has to do better than come out with negative responses. I would suggest that one action he may take is to use the pressure that he has through his party to get on to the Victorian Government and get it backing this package so that we can maximise the support to the woolgrowers who need it.

         I did have an opportunity to discuss with him his recent discussions with President Clinton about trade differences between the United States and Japan and to affirm Australia's position in favour of free rather than managed trade. I think that for Prime Minister Miyazawa this is an important affirmation because he is taking the view that the Government of Japan cannot make commitments on behalf of commercial companies and that the notion of managed trade is a basis of regulation of imports into Japan. As he said himself very forthrightly in Washington, `These are the very problems, of course, the old Soviet Union had. You are urging us to help them get out of it while at the same time we are being urged to get into it'. He was very forthright in his support for an open and non-discriminatory trading system.

         We discussed the prospects of the G7 meeting, which he will chair in Tokyo later this year—I think in July—and I urged Prime Minister Miyazawa to look at ways in which Japan might help generate some new momentum on the Uruguay Round. Largely, the Uruguay Round has been a negotiation or discussion between the United States and the Europeans—mainly the French—with the Cairns Group, which we lead, being the other large bloc of countries which has participated fully in the Uruguay Round from the time it began.

         Japan, on the other hand, is the second largest industrial country in the world. While Japan has been a participant in the Uruguay Round, it has not played a leading role in shifting the Europeans—the French and others—in support of the United States on some of the issues where the United States has displayed very clear leadership. I suggested to Prime Minister Miyazawa that perhaps Japan might play a role in starting the round; that is, adopting the Dunkel package and seeking to provide some impetus through the G7 meeting in July to try to get the round shifted again to give the United States a hand in getting that focus back onto European policy to see whether we could bring the round to a conclusion.

         To bring the round to a conclusion would provide a nice philosophical backdrop to trade right around the world.

A reaffirmation of the principles of free and freer trade through the Uruguay Round also sets some of the scenery in the United States and some of the scenery for this backdrop on trade between the United States and Japan.

I told him that I thought the work of the eminent persons group in developing a framework agreement for the November meeting in Seattle could give tremendous impetus to APEC as a trade liberalising force.

         With a backdrop in the Uruguay Round for trade and the enhancement of trade generally, but within APEC in particular, we would have a much better context not only for all of us to improve our access to markets around the world, but particularly for the United States and Japan to work out their problems. Prime Minister Miyazawa also made very clear his support for a heads of government meeting of APEC leaders which would give APEC even more force, not simply as a ministerial group but one where periodically the leaders of the particular nations could come together to kick along the APEC agenda.

         There is a lot of interest in the Asia-Pacific area. There is now a lot of interest in North America in the capacity of APEC. But, again, it will be better if the general backdrop via the Uruguay Round is completed. It would then see us in a position where we could take better opportunities to trade in our region and where the velocity of trade would improve as impediments came down, but where this relationship between the United States and Japan concerning the very large trade imbalance in Japan's favour could be worked out in a more conducive setting, rather than simply seeking bilateral recourse through, in a sense, discriminatory non-commercial measures which have not worked in the past.

         I judged the meeting with Prime Minister Miyazawa to be a very helpful one from Australia's point of view. I think, from his remarks, that he made the same judgment from Japan's point of view. It was a pleasure having him here. His comprehension of the issues not just in economic terms but also the foreign policy issues involving things which we are doing together—such as Cambodia, et cetera—demonstrated that the Prime Minister of Japan is very much across all the issues personally and can make very clear and obvious policy responses himself. He has indicated that he will do that in respect of APEC, and I hope in respect of the Uruguay Round as well. In all, it was a successful visit. I am sure most Australians would have been very pleased to see him in this country.

Together with my colleagues the Minister for Primary Industries and Energy and the Minister for Trade, I chair the Agri-Food Council, which I think has proved to be a very successful initiative of this Government to help a very exciting sector of the Australian economy. Honourable members will be aware that we currently export about $2.3 billion worth of value added food products from this country. In the wider sense, we are one of the largest food exporters in the world.

         The only criticism that can be made of this sector is that it has not reached out energetically enough to grab the dividend that is there for this country to grasp by pursuing, in a perhaps dignified but aggressive way, some of the opportunities that are present in our region. What are those opportunities? I think with a little bit of creativity, hard work and involvement on behalf of the Government—something that the Opposition would rail against—we can look to the prospect of trebling our value added food exports from $2.3 billion to about $7 billion by the end of the decade. That would come as great news to the 170,000 Australians who work in this industry.

         The essence of our approach is to ensure that Australia has comparative advantages in this area. We have a country that has, thankfully, a very clean environment relative to the rest of the world and a very high quality regime for food growing and food production. If we can bring those things together and use them as the basis for a renewed thrust into export markets, then I think there is great potential indeed. In that context the Agrifood Council determined a successful tender last week to go into Taiwan, marketing with a generic theme all of those products where Australia may grab this export advantage or even an import substitution advantage.

         Earlier today the Prime Minister referred to some of the underlying realities that allow these possibilities. For example, we have Australia's now obviously competitive tax depreciation and investment allowances regime. Productivity growth can be improved, but there has been sea change in that area. We also have industrial harmony and a low inflation outlook. Taken together, these are the underpinnings to the strong export performance we saw during the last year where we had a 20 per cent growth mainly from our small and medium enterprises in the manufacturing sector. That showed just what this country can achieve with governments, employees and companies working together in the national interest.

         Tourism earnt Australia $8 billion in foreign exchange, which is more than wool and wheat combined. Tourism currently employs more than 460,000 Australians which is an increase of around 120,000 jobs during the life of the Hawke and Keating governments. These achievements in the field of tourism were built on the foundations laid by the Whitlam Government, and the late Frank Stewart. Underpinning the successful growth of arrivals was a dramatic increase in tourists from the rapidly expanding Asian economies. Arrivals from North-East Asia, excluding Japan, increased by 38 per cent in 1992, while arrivals from South-East Asia increased by 29 per cent.

The increase we are now achieving in tourist arrivals from these Asian countries, I believe, is the direct result of the Prime Minister's decision in One Nation to increase funding to the Australian Tourist Commission by $15 million over the past two years.

         The continued growth in the housing industry is the result of the Government's resolve to keep inflation under control and interest rates down. These fundamentals have led to housing being more affordable over the last 12 months than at any time in the last decade. It has also meant that the housing sector has been able to provide employment and an economic stimulus as we move out of recession. The robust growth in the industry has prompted the Indicative Planning Council for the Housing Industry to revise upwards its estimates for the 1992-93 year to 161,000 units.

We are looking at affordability that is better than it has been for many years, certainly for the last 10 years, and we are looking at the Government's policy of encouraging more choice and a situation where that choice is being taken up. There are many smaller households; there are a lot more town houses and units being built. The result of all that is that we are able to make much better use of our infrastructure. So our policies are working well, and they are reflected by a very strong and very buoyant industry.

        When you said that, did you have in mind the alleged porn video makers, people jumping bail from drug charges, struck off solicitors and people connected with the Marshall Islands scam? Why on earth could the Government not ensure that the tendering processes for pay TV licences did not produce this sort of farce and did not make us the laughing stock of the international television and investment communities?

I am talking about your shadow Minister, not about the policy of this side of the House. The Australian Broadcasting Authority is undertaking its rightful role under the legislation, and the ABA and the Trade Practices Commission will look at the aspects they have to. The ABA will make a determination about suitability, and the TPC will determine on competition. That will then be referred back to the ABA and the ABA, if it is satisfied, will write to the bidders telling them that, on the expiry of 30 days and the payment of the moneys tendered, they will receive the licences.

You talk, you discuss, you bring policy together and you actually announce it and stick to it. That is what the Government has done since 1983, right throughout. I had the pleasure with the first question of articulating exactly how we are legislating this week for things we said we would do in the course of the election campaign and before. But we will not be keeping policy under wraps. The Leader of the Opposition said:

        That is the sort of policy making we will not be doing. We will not be saying one thing and meaning another. We will not be out there proselytising about a policy upon which the whole mountain of policy must sit and then say, `For political liability reasons we had to drop it'. We will be doing as we have always done: working through our policy framework carefully, consulting with the various interest groups in this country, the business community and the trade unions—all people, including renters—and arriving at policy outcomes which the Government thinks can advance the common cause of the country, and we will see ourselves advanced economically and socially. We will not be keeping things under wraps for a couple of years.

         I am very surprised by this first Question Time. What has a man got to do to get a question around here from the Opposition? There has been nothing. Here I am, briefed up, ready and raring to go, and nothing has come my way. After the moment of the election campaign and the issues involved, to have the Leader of the Opposition chasing down issues of pay television policy, as he has tried to do with his shadow Minister today, demonstrates the breadth with which those opposite were going to come at the Government today. One issue goes across their trail, and away they go after that.

Of course, I am not letting it go by. I am making it clear just how ineffective this Opposition will be.

         Pay TV is simply the big picture writ small. Pay TV is what happens when one looks at the performance of this Government and the chaos of its policy making in a particular area of policy. The man at the centre of this shambles is the Minister for Transport and Communications (Senator Collins). Of course Senator Collins does not like this. He has set out to blame everybody else—to blame his department, to blame the Opposition—but, whatever happens, to move fast. He is moving very fast, and that is something that one might not expect of someone like Senator Collins. But even when he moves fast Senator Collins presents a very substantial target. He has done that in the last two days.

          In his view there was no need for a substantial financial commitment by the tenderers, but then, in his very last answer, he contradicted himself. He said that, although the Government sees no need for it, it is introducing legislation. That is what is happening. The Government, apparently, has committed no fault in this regard. It is not quite clear what the fault is. The Minister has admitted the fault, but that was not the fault. But the Government is introducing legislation in order to ensure that any alternative bidders who enter the process will have to pay this deposit.

         —The Minister says, `Subsequently'. So it was not necessary on the first bid, but it is necessary on all subsequent bids. The logic of that probably escapes the industry; it certainly escapes all those on this side of the House and I dare say it probably escapes Senator Richardson. It escapes anybody who follows this process. Yet the Minister has failed totally to provide the House with any explanation of the shambles which has made this country a laughing stock worldwide amongst all involved in the media industry and in financial circles.

         Looking at Senator Collins's responsibility and how to some extent he is shifting the fire to the hapless Minister for Communications, let us go back to the determination that Senator Collins issued on 19 January. That determination called for bids for pay television and set out the rules for those bids. Those rules required the bidders to pay a $500 non-refundable deposit. The Minister says, `Oh, well, it is an application charge. It is not a deposit'. Five hundred dollars was all that was required of the bidders; no evidence whatever was required of substantial financial strength or commitment to the bid.

         It was a set of guidelines, a set of rules, for the tendering process which completely neglected the public interest of this country. It was a set of rules which opened the way to speculation, to abuse of the process and to interminable delays in the awarding of the pay TV licence. We ask today in the House who was responsible for the departure from normal tendering processes. Here is the cover sheet to the determination.

Senator Collins has endorsed the cover note but not endorsed its contents. We are seeing the pattern, the shambles, which we know too well from this Government: the endorsement of the cover and the running away from the contents. It is no wonder that the Minister has become a laughing stock and has put his Ministry right on the line. Under our system he has signed the determination. It was his duty to ask questions and to look at the advice that the Department gave him. He should have read the rules that were suggested by the Department and asked questions about them. He should have satisfied himself that they were the appropriate rules.

         As has been commented in the press today, it is remarkable how little Senator Collins has learnt about his portfolio given his time in the position. He is very uncomfortable about the technology in the portfolio. The Prime Minister came in, because he never likes to see a shambles going on without stirring the pot, and changed the rules for microwave transmission. The Minister himself now says that he did not know.

         In order to increase the expertise available to the Government on this subject, the Government has appointed the Minister for Communications, who is on the other side of the table, as its specialist Minister for this portfolio. This is the Minister who in the last Parliament was famous for reading the indications given by his indicative indicators and telling us that we should not be troubled by the rate of bankruptcy in small business in this country. That was the grasp that he had on this portfolio.

         It is understandable that people on this side of the House were sympathetic to the industry's howls of concern and outrage when the appointment was made. The industry believed that communications deserved a proper and strong representation in the Cabinet. It had Richo. I do not know whether it retains any unfortunate misconceptions about Senator Collins, but it was concerned when this Minister stepped into the role. Into the swamp he wandered. He obviously saw his role in the communications industry as Mr Sunshine, because he was not troubled when the successful bids were announced. In fact, he said that, contrary to the views of those experienced in the industry, he was not surprised that there were bids of up to $170 million. He said that he was delighted that these bids had been made and that he would be able to present the Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) with $389 million for the Budget. He was not concerned at the fact that the winning bidder might be a bidder of very little substance.

         It is extraordinary not that the bidders should be given their chance—of course they should be—to find the money for this licence bid but that one of these companies had only been in existence for three weeks. Some of them have got old friends, whom we recognise from earlier discussions in this House. I have with me here a document of the Republic of the Marshall Islands Investment Trust. There are some familiar names attached to this document, including Bruce Dennis and Bruce Hocking, legal and financial advisers to the Republic of the Marshall Islands Investment Trust, in which as we know Senator Richardson had a relation involved.

         It is true that totally different criteria, in the Government's view, should now be applied to any alternative bidders. One of the ways in which the public interest was totally betrayed in this case was that it was possible for the winning bidders to put in multiple reducing bids so that if they could not raise the money on the first bid they would be able to raise it hopefully at a lesser level on the second bid or the third bid—the disappearing bids, as they vanish. That is the system that the Government set up and the Minister is trying to defend it, saying that everything is appropriate.

         No wonder even Senator Richardson is running very hard to get himself out of the firing line. He is quite willing to point the finger at the Minister, who has been told by Senator Collins that the process has to be changed. Senator Collins is dragging him in—the friendly, helping hand that the Prime Minister spoke about is reaching down from the Senate chamber into the House of Representatives and drawing the Minister for Communications very close to him. This is a process for which the Minister here and Senator Collins are deeply responsible, which has betrayed the public interest of this country and has created a shambles. That shows what we can expect from this Government as time goes on. It has had no plans; it has had no policy; it has had no vision; and it has no capacity to govern this country.

He obviously has no grasp of the communications industry, so perhaps what I will do now is educate him on the matter.

         As I said in Question Time, one of the most important things to keep in perspective is the policy outcome desired by the Government in a national pay TV regime—that is, providing the Australian people with a national system of pay television that is delivered by a satellite system using compressed digital technology. That is the policy; the policy is still in place.

         —Unlike the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson), I do not need notes. In fact, the policy is to deliver to the Australian public a national system of pay television through the Optus satellite using compressed digital technology. We looked at the best possible way to do that. The Government determined that we would have a price based tender. That price based tender was determined to be the most effective way to maximise the return to the Government, in essence, to maximise return to the Australian taxpayer. That is what the process has been about.

I want to take honourable members through the whole process of how it was set up, because I think that is important. The process to allocate licence A and licence B following the close of tenders involved basically three steps: bids assessed on price only, with impartial means of selecting who goes on to the next stage; the ABA and the Trade Practices Commission to institute the checks; and the final price bid to be paid at the expiration of 30 days and the licence issued.

         The detail of the process was that a decision was made by the communications selection team, with the Attorney-General's advice, conforming to the highest bids. The highest price tender was then identified for each licence, licence A and licence B. The important point is that there was always an intent to get an additional player into the market and that is why licence A was reserved for new players, whereas licence B was open to all comers. Details of the successful tenderers were then referred to the Australian Broadcasting Authority by the Secretary to the Department of Transport and Communications to enable the process to be undertaken for the issue of the licences.

         The Australian Broadcasting Authority will need to form a view about the suitability of the applicants under section 98 of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992. The Australian Broadcasting Authority has referred the ownership details of each tender to the Trade Practices Commission for an opinion under section 93(7) of the Broadcasting Services Act 1992 regarding compliance with part IV of the Trade Practices Act 1974. The Trade Practices Commission has a maximum of 45 days to provide the opinion to the ABA, but it can obviously take much less time, depending on the complexity of the issues involved.

         We are trying to ensure that the policy intent of the Government is implemented through due process. The difficulty we now have is that if there were, as the Leader of the Opposition interjected, a large number of bidders who were not able to meet the financial requirement, then we could have an unnecessary delay in the process. That is where, as I said, we have identified a possible deficiency in the process. We have a statutory requirement that the money has to be paid 30 days from the ABA advising the successful tenderer that not only has it been through the ABA's hoops, but that it has also met the preconditions of the Trade Practices Commission. That particular amendment was moved in the Senate and was referred to by Senator Collins on the weekend as adding an additional 45 days to the whole process. That is not necessarily the case because the Trade Practices Commission may find that there is no problem with competition policy and therefore it could find after a period of much less than 45 days and advise the ABA that it can proceed with its checks.

        my mind goes back to that classic episode where Jim Hacker was absolutely delighted when his department advised him that it had been a pleasure to work with him.

         Obviously, we are seeing the same sort of thing happening with this particular debate today. In my 15 or 16 years in this Parliament we have never seen such a pathetic performance from a Minister who, frankly, does not know what it is all about. He has the hide to come in here today and say that at the end of the day what the Government wants is a policy and a pay TV system that are the best for the Australian public. I think that just defies description. The reality is that this country could have had pay television 10 years ago, and for the 10 years of this Labor Government we have seen nothing but procrastination, nothing but changes of policy, nothing but continual intervention by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating), to the stage where today we have a situation of absolutely high farce and the reputation of Australia as a major player in the broadcasting game is in jeopardy. We have enjoyed one of the highest reputations in the world, but we are going to have real problems with the overseas financial sources, who see the way that we do business in this place as a bit of a joke.

         At the end of the day are we going to end up with anything? Are we really going to see the advent of pay television in Australia? Sadly, it is possible that we will not see it because this process that we have been exposed to over the last couple of days will go on and on and on. Another commentator said in one of the papers this morning that the process at the moment was a bit like peeling an onion: you take off one layer and you find nothing there, and you go to the next layer. We have learned that there are 50 bidders. Do we have to go through this whole process with 50 bidders only to find in about five years time that there is nobody left because everybody has given up and gone away? That is the real tragedy of this particular situation that is facing us today. It is absolutely incredible to see the blithering incompetence of the Minister at the table, knowing that in the other place we have another blithering incompetent in charge of a portfolio that is one of the most crucial in this nation.

         It is not just in relation to pay television that this Government has been found out. Senator Collins is exactly the same Minister who sat there and defended his department all the way through the granting of the new aviation systems—the TAAATS systems—for air navigation in Australia. He sat there and he backed the department up and he ran the departmental line the whole time. It was such an unholy mess that he had to appoint the Hon. Ian Macphee to head an independent inquiry into it. Mr Macphee found that the government processes were all wrong and that Senator Collins had made an absolute botch of things. That is just one example.

         We have another example that hit the decks yesterday. There was an incident at Brisbane airport last year when a 727 aircraft had to make an emergency landing. What do we find? The department of which Senator Collins is the head released a report yesterday with most of the graphic details and most of the serous criticisms of the department and the Minister blanked out. They are not there. The department was not game to tell the people what was really going on with the administration of the Civil Aviation Authority. Once again the responsible Minister was Senator Collins.

         We have a real difficulty in this particular portfolio because we have a Minister who does not have a clue in the world about the technicalities of what is a very complex portfolio area. There is no doubt that Australians are getting to a stage where, if they ever get pay television, they may have very great difficulty in affording it. What we are talking about here is not just the $500 for registration, or indeed the five per cent. We are talking about delaying tactics that are costing tens and tens of thousands of dollars, and ultimately if we do get some system of pay television it may well be beyond the reach of the average Australian. If a company has to put a couple of hundred million dollars up for a licence, what is it going to cost by the time it puts in the equipment, buys the first release movies, buys the international news services and buys the rights to major sporting events? The industry estimates that at the moment it will cost about $800 million to put the thing together.

         Will ordinary Australians be able to afford to subscribe to pay television? When we look at what has happened in the United Kingdom, we see that it has a system of two players who have a monopoly. Even with that population, one of them has gone out of business. The plain fact is that the delivery of the pay TV services through this particular system is particularly expensive. What about the changes that have been brought about by this particular Government, by the interference of the Prime Minister, by the succession of Ministers into the nature of the technology that Australians could have enjoyed?

         We see in the courts at the moment the process against the Cosser organisation and the throwing overboard—or what will be retrospectively obviously thrown overboard—of the NBS delivery system. Look at those reports and the studies that were done by a committee of this House which in fact made a recommendation that Australia should look at going towards microwave technology so that we could deliver pay television to every home in Australia at a very affordable rate. Even now, Telecom has the capacity to be able to deliver up to 50 channels of television into the homes of most Australians.

There is very little time left for us to get to a stage where all Australians can benefit from the advantages that pay television can bring, both in an entertainment sense and in an information sense. Quite frankly, we are not going to get it out of this lot of blithering incompetents.

         —In this matter of public importance today, it is interesting to note that in all the changes that have taken place in telecommunications and communications over the last few years, all initiated by the Government, we have always had the spectacle of the Opposition saying we were in the process of picking winners; we were looking after mates; we were doing all those things rather than allowing technology to rip, the market to rip, and so on.

         What have we seen from the former shadow Minister for communications? He is no longer in this place, I suspect partly because of some of the statements that he was making in these areas but also because throughout this whole process the former shadow Minister and the Opposition have not cared about the affordability of pay TV or services to the Australian community. The Opposition has never regarded those things as important, and there has been a constant litany of statements and press releases attacking the Government and stating that all of the Government's policies on pay TV were about looking after its media mates.

         In January, those opposite criticised the Government's proposals in relation to not allowing MDS, inferior technology, to jeopardise the potential for comprehensive pay TV services. The Government realised the potential impact of MDS proceeding in that way. It decided, quite rightly in my view, to look at how satellite and digital technology could be used. Since then, the Opposition has continually said that the Government was getting its hand into this process in an unwarranted fashion—picking winners, as the honourable member for Goldstein (Dr Kemp) said today.

         We adopted the price based process. One can argue that pay TV, because of the constantly evolving changes in technology, does need a fair amount of flexibility in the approach taken. That is true. It is difficult to predict what technology and its impact on communications delivery will be in a year from now, but if we accept that the price based approach is the approach to adopt and that the real concern is to get the best price and to have new players—as the Opposition has argued from time to time; it has said that existing players do not count—then we will adopt the sorts of approaches that the Opposition talked about in the Senate inquiry.

         If we were to go back and read the debates in this place as well, we would note that in the last Parliament the Opposition argued that we were putting too many threshold restrictions on pay TV. Because we were concerned about content, about industry plans and about the involvement of the ABC in pay TV the Opposition said that we were being unduly restrictive and not letting the market have free rein. As a result of the election on 13 March, there may be some change in attitude on the part of the Opposition. Maybe the ideology that drove it prior to 13 March has changed as a result of the election. Certainly all of the statements that it made to that time indicated that it was only interested in the bottom line price of pay TV: get it delivered as quickly as possible; to hell with whatever consequences there might be of inferior technology and so on.

In any event, most of the experts in the field indicate quite clearly that pay TV will be only a marginal operation for the first few years. Of course, there is the need to get the financial support critical to that process.

That was important. It has been shown now through the bidding process why that experience, why that level of expertise, is important if we are to have comprehensive and affordable pay TV for the Australian community.

The process that was adopted—at the explicit direction of the Senate—as to the role the ABA and the Trade Practices Commission would have in determining the bidding process should be allowed to be followed and completed. It is clear that in that process there is the potential for follow-on thresholds to be unnecessarily delayed and restricted. So the Government quite rightly has foreshadowed that it will make the change to the threshold relating to the five per cent deposit fee.

         I come now to some of the other issues in the debate about pay television over recent times. The honourable member for Fadden referred to the use of microwave technology and the Government's failure to let that process run its course, resulting in legal proceedings, et cetera. It is clear from that whole process that the development of technology has been supported pretty broadly as far as the use of digital technology and the desire to encourage in the broader Australian community a very comprehensive allocation of pay television opportunities are concerned. The best way to do that is to ensure that we use technology which will not be out of date and which will not minimise access to pay TV services across the nation. If we allow the MDS network to proceed, we know that the limitations of that process will automatically mean that many people will be denied access to pay TV.

         Some people say there is not quite as high a demand for pay TV as some in the media would suggest. Ultimately, what matters is that the pay TV regime we adopt will give all Australians a chance to watch what is on offer. We want pay TV to create the opportunity to extend Australian production and to give Australian industry the opportunity to develop and advance as a result. These things never matter to the Opposition, but they are important if we believe in the ongoing development of our communications industry.

         I come back to the fundamental points in the debate about pay TV. Throughout the whole process, the Opposition has constantly accused the Government of having `media mates', `picking winners' and so on. But an arm's length approach has been adopted which is effectively providing the very scenario the Opposition has argued should be adopted. Senator Alston's amendments from the Senate were all adopted. Yet Opposition members still have the hide to come in here and criticise Government Ministers because they adopt a process which is fundamentally the same as the one the Opposition has followed.

        I am pleased to introduce the Protection of the Sea (Oil Pollution Compensation Fund) Bill 1993 to the House as part of a package of four Bills concerning compensation for damage caused by oil spills from tankers. The purpose of the Bills is to give effect to the International Convention on the Establishment of an International Fund for Compensation for Oil Pollution Damage 1971. The convention is widely referred to as the fund convention. The Bill will also enable Australia to give effect in due course to protocols amending the fund convention adopted in 1976 and 1992, although neither of these has yet entered into force internationally.

         The international regime providing compensation for damages caused by oil spills from tankers is governed by the fund convention and another convention, the International Convention on Civil Liability for Oil Pollution Damage 1969, known as the civil liability convention. Both conventions were drawn up under the auspices of the International Maritime Organisation, which is a specialised agency of the United Nations. Australia has been a party to the civil liability convention since 1984, and its requirements are implemented by the Protection of the Sea (Civil Liability) Act 1981. The civil liability convention deals with the liability of shipowners for pollution damage and currently guarantees that some $A266 per ton of the ships tonnage up to a maximum of $A28 million is available to Australian interests in the event of oil pollution damage.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         The fund convention is supplementary to the civil liability convention and establishes a regime for compensating victims when the compensation under the civil liability convention is inadequate. This is achieved by applying an annual levy to any oil company which receives after carriage by ship more than 150,000 tonnes of contributing oil in a calendar year. `Contributing oil' for the purposes of the convention includes mainly crude oil and heavy fuel oil. Non-persistent oils such as gasoline, light diesel oil and kerosene do not fall within the scope of the convention. Thus the burden of providing compensation for oil pollution damage is shared between the ship and cargo owners.

         Acceptance of the fund convention will immediately increase the amount of compensation for oil pollution damage available to Australian interests to some $A120 million. This will increase to $A400.8 million when the 1992 protocol amending the convention enters into force and certain other conditions are met. It is not possible to predict when the 1992 protocol will enter into force, as it is entirely dependent on how quickly the required level of international acceptance is forthcoming. I would be surprised, however, if it were not either in force or substantially close to it within five years.

         The fund convention represents the legal intergovernmental version of a voluntary scheme set up by the major international oil companies in 1971. The scheme is called the Contract regarding Interim Supplement to Tanker Liability for Oil Pollution, abbreviated to CRISTAL. This scheme still exists but was only developed as a temporary measure until the fund convention achieved a sufficiently high level of acceptance internationally. CRISTAL is due to cease operation in February 1994.

         The fund convention has established a worldwide intergovernmental organisation, the International Oil Pollution Compensation Fund, known as the IOPC Fund, to administer the compensation regime. Reports on quantities of oil received in a calendar year are forwarded by governments to the IOPC Fund, with the contributions being paid by the individual companies directly to the IOPC Fund. There are currently 51 member countries.

         There are two types of contributions to the IOPC Fund. An initial contribution is payable by receivers of oil when a country becomes a member of the IOPC Fund. Annual contributions are levied to meet the anticipated payments of compensation, indemnification and administrative expenses during the subsequent year. Annual contributions therefore vary widely, and since the fund convention entered into force internationally in 1978 the total amount required from contributors in all member countries has varied from zero to $A60 million. The IOPC Fund paid out over $A20 million in claims during 1992.

         Based on 1992 figures for the transportation of oil into and around Australia, the nine Australian companies which receive more than 150,000 tonnes of contributing oil per year would be required to contribute to the IOPC fund a combined total of some $138,000 as an initial contribution and $568,000 in the following year as an annual contribution. It can be seen that the outlay is relatively small in comparison to the compensation available, and these contributions would replace existing CRISTAL contributions.

         Although the convention entered into force internationally in 1978, until recently successive Australian governments were opposed to Australian acceptance of the convention on the ground that the risk of major oil pollution damage occurring in Australia was low, and that consequently Australia would be subsidising countries of higher risk.

         Adoption of the convention and protocols and the passage of the Bills currently before the House will place Australia in the international forefront of providing compensation for damages caused by oil pollution from tankers. The measures contained in the Bills will not have any effect on Commonwealth revenue and they will have no significant effect on Commonwealth expenditure. I commend the Bill to the House and present the explanatory memorandum for the four Bills, that is, this Bill, the Protection of the Sea (Imposition of Contributions to Oil Pollution Compensation Fund—Customs) Bill, Protection of the Sea (Imposition of Contributions to Oil Pollution Compensation Fund—Excise) Bill and Protection of the Sea (Imposition of Contributions to Oil Pollution Compensation Fund—General) Bill.

        The purpose of the Road Transport Charges (Australian Capital Territory) Bill 1993 is to give effect to the National Road Transport Commission's first determination regarding annual registration charges for vehicles rated above 4.5 tonnes and permit charges for vehicles operating above 125 tonnes. The Bill is vital to the Government's national micro-economic reform agenda for land transport.

         For too long the efficiency of Australia's interstate road transport operations has been impeded by a lack of uniformity in regulations and charging. Currently, heavy vehicle operating conditions and registration charges vary considerably between nine different jurisdictions and bear little relation to the costs imposed on the road system by various types of vehicles.

         The NRTC, which is an independent statutory authority, was established as a result of the Heads of Government Agreement of July 1991 and set up under Commonwealth legislation passed in December of that year. Its purpose is to investigate and make recommendations regarding the establishment of a national registration scheme and uniform road use charges for heavy vehicles, and nationally consistent operating regulations for all vehicles.

         In accordance with the intergovernmental agreement, this Bill will require the government of the Australian Capital Territory, from 1 July 1995 onwards, to fix annual registration charges for vehicles rated above 4.5 tonnes and to fix charges for the granting of permits to operate vehicles with a gross mass exceeding 125 tonnes. Those charges will be fixed in accordance with the schedule to the Bill. The Bill will not affect the existing registration scheme in the Australian Capital Territory other than to fix the charges to be collected when a heavy vehicle is registered. Responsibility for determining registration exemptions or concessional charges will continue to be a matter for the Australian Capital Territory.

In accordance with this decision, the NRTC charging determination does not make recommendations on the level and structure of concessions.

         In this context, it would be contrary to the spirit of the intergovernmental agreement for governments to impose administration or inspection fees that varied greatly across jurisdictions, as road transport operators would see these as part of the total cost of registering a vehicle. This would encourage operators to shop around between the States and Territories. A working group of officials is currently examining the issue of acceptable and uniform levels of administrative charges and inspection fees and is expected to complete its report in the next couple of months.

         Road transport is an essential part of our land transport system, and approximately 70 per cent of freight which is moved in Australia travels by road at some stage.

        The Bankruptcy Amendment Bill 1993 proposes amendment to a provision of the Bankruptcy Act 1966 which is a small but significant feature of the compulsory income contribution regime provided for in the Act. The Bankruptcy Act enables a trustee to make an assessment of the income a bankrupt is likely to derive during the period of bankruptcy and where the income is assessed as being above a specified threshold the bankrupt is liable to make contributions from his or her income of 50c in each dollar above that threshold. Section 139ZG of the Act enables a trustee to file a certificate in a court of competent jurisdiction in respect of amounts of contribution which a bankrupt has refused or failed to pay. The Act provides that such a certificate operates and is enforceable as if it were a final judgment of the court in which it is filed.

         There are proceedings currently on foot in the High Court of Australia which challenge the validity of subsections 139ZG(3), (4) and (5) on the basis that, because a bankruptcy trustee's certificate is given the status of a judgment of the court in which it is filed, the provisions enable a person who is not a judge or holder of other judicial office to exercise the judicial power of the Commonwealth, contrary to chapter III of the Constitution. The Government has been advised that there is a significant likelihood of the provisions being declared to be invalid. The case is scheduled for hearing before the court on 7 June 1993.

         The Government is concerned that there should be adequate means of enforcing the obligations of bankrupts to make contributions from income to their estates. This Bill proposes the substitution of the impugned procedure with new provisions which give the trustee a right to take action in the courts against a bankrupt who has refused or failed to pay income contributions to the estate. The trustee will be able to file a certificate in relation to any proceedings for the recovery of such debts stating the nature of the debt and the amount owed, and the certificate will be prima facie evidence of those matters. The Government has been advised that the revised provisions could not be considered to trespass upon the judicial power of the Commonwealth since the trustee will be required to initiate court proceedings to recover amounts of unpaid income contribution from a bankrupt.

         The Government moved decisively in 1991 to tighten up bankruptcy law in response to community concern that certain high-flying bankrupts were avoiding their responsibilities to creditors. This was done by introducing a compulsory income contribution regime specifically designed to prevent persons from diverting income at source to associated entities and putting it beyond the reach of creditors. The present High Court challenge was initiated by one of the persons whose activities gave rise to the community concern to which I have referred.

In addition, there are three Supply Bills—Supply Bill (No. 1) 1993-94, Supply Bill (No. 2) 1993-94 and Supply (Parliamentary Departments) Bill 1993-94—appropriating some $15 billion for government expenditure to 30 November 1993.

         The object of Supply is to ensure that finance is available for the ongoing services of government until the next appropriation should be made as part of the 1993 Budget. However, it appears from the Commonwealth financial accounts that the position of the Commonwealth Budget at the moment is alarming. In the Budget last year it was estimated that the deficit, the shortfall, in this financial year would be around $13.4 billion. In February of this year, that was revised downwards, and the current estimate is that in this financial year the Commonwealth will come in with a deficit of about $15.9 billion. That means that every day during the financial year the Commonwealth will be overspending by about $43 million; that is, spending about $43 million more than it raises in all of its revenue activities for every day during the financial year 1992-93. But it does not stop there. In absolute terms, the projected Budget deficit of $15.9 billion is the highest ever in the Commonwealth account.

         Those honourable members who have been in this House for some time will have memories of the current Prime Minister (Mr Keating), who swaggered his way through seven, eight or nine years as Treasurer, whenever he got into trouble looking at the Opposition and saying, `Remember in 1982-83 the Budget deficit could have gone to $9.6 billion'. It did not, of course; it came in at around $7.9 billion, about half of that which the deficit will come in under his prime ministership. He is still talking about it 10 years after the event, and it was about half of that which will come in this year.

         In percentage terms, the Budget deficit in this financial year as a measure of GDP will be about 3.9 per cent. In 1982-83 it was about 2.6 per cent. That is, this year the loss that the Commonwealth shows on its revenue and outlays account will be half as much again as a percentage of GDP. This will be a Budget deficit of Whitlamesque proportions. It is the only period that we can compare with the dreadful and alarming state of the Commonwealth Budget deficit in this particular year.

         But it does not stop there. When the current Minister for Finance (Mr Willis) became the Minister for Finance back in March of 1990 he had a surplus of around $8 billion. He has not only taken back that surplus but also gone into deficit of about $15.9 billion in a three-year period. In a three-year period he has gone from a surplus to a deficit of historic proportions—an overall turnaround of about $33 billion. That is the three-year record of the Minister for Finance. It is very hard to know whether that record will ever be matched in the history of the Commonwealth. We have heard about the six million dollar man. This is the $33 billion Minister—I suppose I should say `malad-Minister'—who has taken that surplus and come in with a record of historic proportions.

I do not know if the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer (Mr Johns), who is at the table, has come up with any money raising schemes recently. He could probably make himself a hero with Ralph too, if he could walk in with a few of these funny money schemes and say to Ralph,`Perhaps you might go and look for a Pakistani commodities dealer'.

         It is quite clear that when the Government gets into a financial problem of this dimension, when it is on the end of this large financial difficulty, considered and measured and long thought out policy goes out the window. It just cannot afford it. It has to go for anybody who raises his or her hand on pay TV and say, `You have it', because it is looking for dollars everywhere. The Australian public are going to be in for a very bad period of short-term decision making as we have this scramble for dollars to try and make good all the logical impossibilities that are fronting up against this Government. It is true, as was said in debate earlier in the House, that we have become a laughing stock over this pay TV business but the real problem, the underlying problem, that gets us into this position is wanton financial management.

He really used to think that a Minister for Finance had the obligation to say no, to try and make the accounts balance at the end of the day. But this is a Minister who has taken no responsibility, whose conviction pales beside the measure of his predecessor because he has been unable to match the duties that ought to be expected of him as a Minister.

To review our labour market programs, including our youth labour market program.

He said, `We had to have a recession to stop current account deficit numbers of that dimension'. He plunged this country into recession. He blew the Commonwealth Budget.

We now see the current account deficit back where it was at the start, only this time we are coming off not a Budget surplus, as we were at the beginning of the recession, but the worst Budget deficit ever in absolute terms; in percentage terms of Whitlamesque proportions, and into the bargain we have one million unemployed Australians.

         Of course, when we front up to some of the political debates that are on the agenda at the moment, constitutional debates and the topic so beloved of our Prime Minister—independence under an Australian head of state—perhaps we ought to remember where the real threat to Australian independence comes from. There is no independence in having an Australian head of state if economic policy is determined by foreign banks. That is no independence, no independence at all. The real threat to Australia's economic sovereignty is to make sure that we as Australians so manage our own affairs that we, through elections, through the people who stand in this place and through the Ministers who are appointed to serve in the Government, have complete freedom of decision making and that they so manage things that they do not get into hock to overseas interests.

         It is quite clear that the other part of the very urgent need which will be addressed in this Parliament—I hope by the Government—over the next couple of years will be the falling levels of Australian savings. The ANZ saving report for December of 1992, which was released recently, noted that public sector saving was at 3.6 per cent in 1988, but plunged by December 1992 to minus five per cent.

I am glad that the shadow Minister for finance, the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello), raised the question of savings because it is central to the health of the Australian economy. I want to address in this debate the question of superannuation, which is one of the most prominent vehicles that this Government has arranged so that Australians can make provision for their own futures. In this way, superannuation becomes a most important tool by which to improve the nation's savings.

         As I read the public debate, the concept of superannuation is not as widely known or appreciated in the Australian community as I would like, yet its growing importance and its now compulsory nature means that it cannot be ignored and we cannot afford to have it misunderstood. As 1993 will undoubtedly become a major signpost on the road to retirement income reform, it would be of some use to reflect for a moment on the road that the Government has travelled in achieving that reform, and this will provide us with a backdrop against which we can tackle the fresh challenges that await us in this new Parliament and for which I have some responsibilities. Superannuation, as I said, is a key weapon in the Government's retirement incomes policy, and that policy is simply to ensure that all people have an adequate and secure level of income in retirement. In achieving that, the Government is committed to providing a minimum acceptable level of income through the social security system and also to encouraging private provision for retirement, notably through superannuation.

         Superannuation is now on the public agenda as never before. Many honourable members would have heard the alarming statistics on Australia's ageing population, but it is worth remembering them to keep the urgency of the situation focused in our minds. Over the next 20 years the baby boom generation will start reaching pension age. At the moment there are about 1.9 million people, or 11 per cent of the total population, aged 65 or over, but that number will rise to 5.2 million people, or 20 per cent of the population, by the year 2031. In addition, it is probably safe to assume that people retiring now and in the future will expect a higher standard of living than when their parents retired. Adding to the pressure is the fact that people are now living longer. The average life expectancy of men will rise to 81 1/2 years during the next 30 years, and for women it will rise to 87. These figures indicate the urgency and importance of making provision for retirement in the future.

         When Labor came to power in 1983 superannuation was largely the preserve of the upper middle class, white collar workers and public servants. Despite an attempt by the Whitlam Government to construct some sort of national superannuation scheme, the yawning inactivity of the Fraser years ensured that reform was not forthcoming. Superannuation was geared to those who worked full time and was largely a device used by employers to retain or to lock in their employees. Those with intermittent work patterns were mostly excluded. This particularly affected workers with family responsibilities and those working in industries where it is uncommon to have long periods of employment with one employer.

         The introduction of the three per cent award based superannuation in June 1986 and changes in the associated regulatory and taxation arrangements dramatically altered the profile of superannuation. The proportion of employees covered by federal awards who were entitled to award based superannuation has been progressively extended since 1986. Between August 1985 and July 1991 the percentage rose from 39 1/2 per cent to 72.2 per cent. In that time, coverage of part-time employees has increased from 20 per cent to 40 per cent, and coverage of full-time female workers has increased dramatically from just over 24 per cent to 72 1/2 per cent. It was with the introduction of award based contributions that superannuation moved from being a human resource management issue to being a genuine retirement income issue. It was at that time that the focus of superannuation policy was switched from the needs of employers to the needs of workers and the nation.

         With the introduction of the super guarantee charge regime, Australia now has a compulsory, although privatised, national superannuation scheme. The effect and worth of the scheme should not be understated and, given the restrictions imposed by the Constitution, Australia can hold its head high on the international retirement income stage. The SGC scheme requires employers to make fully vested contributions on behalf of their employees at certain, rising rates over the next decade. The SGC scheme underpins the Government's retirement income policy objectives by providing, first, a major extension of superannuation coverage to employees not currently covered by award superannuation; second, an efficient method of encouraging employers to comply with their obligation to provide superannuation to employees; and, third, an orderly mechanism by which the level of employer superannuation support can be increased over time consistent with retirement income policy objectives and the economy's capacity to pay.

         The Government has enacted a coherent and equitable framework in which the retirement income objectives can be progressed. The rising level of required contributions ensures that the nation is eased into contributing at rates which will allow sufficient retirement benefits to be accumulated. Hand in hand with the growth of funds flowing into superannuation is the tightening prudential controls that Labor has enacted and will continue to enact. At the same time as the Government supported the ACTU push for award based superannuation, it also announced its intention to introduce new operational standards for superannuation funds. These serve a dual purpose: to ensure the proposed productivity benefits were genuinely preserved for use in retirement; and to tighten supervisory control over superannuation arrangements. To this end the Government established the Insurance and Superannuation Commission in 1987 and introduced the Occupational Superannuation Standards Act 1987. That allowed for a system of control of the superannuation industry.

         The regulatory reforms are far ranging and acknowledge that although superannuation is not compulsory it is not government guaranteed. The policy of the Government is to supervise the industry to the extent necessary to secure benefits and to ensure that the substantial tax concessions given to superannuation are not dissipated. The Government's supervision also acknowledges that although it has made superannuation compulsory it has not, and will not, guarantee the benefits to individuals through a large government fund. Similarly, the level of supervision must reflect the fact that a superannuation entitlement is one of the largest assets that individuals will amass in their lifetime. Supervision also recognises the relative inflexibility of superannuation as an investment and the lack of control beneficiaries have over their entitlement.

         The other area where the Government has effected substantial reform is in the taxation of superannuation. The cost in terms of revenue forgone of the concessional treatment of superannuation has always been significant. At present the Commonwealth forgoes around $5 billion a year in revenue through these concessions. With the shift, though, from a voluntary to a compulsory system, and in the light of prevailing fiscal requirements which we are now debating, the Government last year pared back some of the incentives to contribute. It is largely realised that generous tax incentives provided under a voluntary scheme are not essential nor affordable under a compulsory scheme.

         The taxation rate of superannuation has long been attacked for its incomprehensibility. The Government made substantial inroads into the complexity of the reasonable benefits limit regime by moving from a complex salary based reasonable benefits limit to a flat dollar limit of $400,000 indexed for lump sums, and $800,000 indexed for annuities. This move was made at no cost to the equity in the system and continued the Government's encouragement of annuities.

         The final achievement I will briefly touch on is the benefit to national savings of the Government's retirement incomes policy. There is currently around $150 billion locked up in superannuation. Current estimates of the size of funds to be held by the end of the decade are $600 billion. This will represent about six to seven per cent of GDP. These figures have significance for the current debate on our level of national savings. The recent press speculation on the outcomes of the inquiry by Dr Vince Fitzgerald have largely nominated compulsory superannuation as one of the best means of increasing national savings.

         Informed speculation also never fails to mention the negligible effect of tax incentives on the level of national savings. In fact, all of the international evidence concludes that tax incentives do not lift national savings but merely shift them from one sector, or savings vehicle, to another. That is why we rely on compulsory savings through our scheme of superannuation.

         There are forces at work, however, that have the capacity to frustrate the Government's retirement incomes policy. Specifically, there are leakages from the system that occur for a variety of reasons, including inadequate vesting and preservation, excessive fees and charges, and insufficient portability. With respect to preservation, the Treasurer announced in his
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Security in retirement
         </emphasis>
         statement of last June that regulations will be introduced to ensure that contributions set aside for retirement will be used for that purpose.

         In addition, one of the key requirements of contributions made pursuant to awards or for superannuation guarantee charge purposes is that they fully vest in workers. These measures will stem the estimated $2.6 billion in leakage from the system per year that Dr Vince Fitzgerald identified for us late last year.

         With respect to the effect of fees and charges, it is refreshing to note the blossoming of the role of industry funds. These funds have delivered cost-effective, reliable and portable superannuation to the bulk of the work force. The cost to an average member is only between $35 and $50 per year. I note that there are other arrangements such as master trusts, employer funds and personal funds which can also accommodate SGC contributions. The Government has not made superannuation compulsory to see contributions consumed by excessive transaction costs. Yet it is ironic that some of our opponents across the chamber have protested against this most refreshing development. It is ironic that in the name of economic efficiency and improved productivity some State governments wish to individualise the administration of superannuation funds under the banner of freedom of choice. It is likely that under their policies gross inefficiencies would result.

         The final threat posed is that relating to the leakage due to early release of benefits for hardship. The Government's policy to date has reflected the need for both commonsense and compassion in dealing with people who fall on hard times. The recession has led to a significant boost in the number of people trying to access their superannuation entitlements before retirement. It is likely that, as we emerge from the recession, this number will fall back to a reasonable level. But in the interim we will continue to monitor that situation so that when people feel it absolutely necessary to have access to their superannuation the ISC can make a decision in their favour. But we certainly will not be opening the floodgates or sending signals to people that superannuation is something that people can call upon as they would call upon a bank account. It is not; it is a long-term investment for the future. It is a savings vehicle that is meant to be put away for people's retirement. In that sense, we simply cannot allow a free rein for people to have a call upon that pool of savings.

         An item which will occupy much of the Government's energy in the near future is tackling the nation's lump sum mentality. As most of us would realise, Australians have a very high attraction to taking their retirement benefits in lump sum form. An important part of the Government's reform will be to engineer a shift in thinking from lump sums to income stream products. Of particular importance will be the role of certain products on offer such as allocated or cash back pensions. It is hoped that, given the appropriate level of government support, these products will help overcome the reluctance of people in the community to take their retirement benefits in income form.

         Without annual improvements to the Commonwealth Budget balance of the magnitude I have mentioned, we will be looking at a Budget deficit of nearly $10 billion in 1995-96, which would be around 2 1/2 per cent of GDP. Again, this takes an optimistic view of Australia's growth prospects in the years immediately ahead. Given more pessimistic growth forecasts, the sort of growth that we are likely to see under Labor, we are looking at reductions of around $3.5 billion a year to get anywhere near the Government's deficit reduction target. I hasten to add that these figures are based on an analysis of the Commonwealth Budget carried out by the Macquarie Bank. However, it should be pointed out that Access Economics has arrived at some very similar estimates. According to Access Economics, in the absence of policy changes we are looking at a Budget deficit for 1996-97 of $12.8 billion, which, on its figures, would amount to 2.3 per cent of GDP.

         So the fiscal outlook for the Commonwealth is bleak, whether one takes an optimistic or a pessimistic view of our economic growth prospects. If the Government is going to realise its goal of reducing the Budget deficit to one per cent of GDP by 1996-97, as is its stated intention, then we need to ask the Government, as whingeing Wendy once asked of us, `Where's the money coming from?'. How will the Government meet its deficit reduction target in the specified time frame? We know that this can only be done by two methods. Those methods are increased taxes or reduced spending, or some combination thereof.

         On the tax side, the Government has already legislated its proposed personal income tax cuts and has committed itself to a reduction in the company tax rate. If we are generous and grant that the Government will keep these promises, then that leaves us with a particularly nasty range of revenue raising options that could be employed in the years ahead to help realise its deficit reduction targets.

         —A GST, but by another name—like the rose that will not smell so sweet. The most likely of these revenue raising options is an expansion of the pernicious wholesale sales tax system—perhaps the most destructive, wealth destroying tax in the Commonwealth's arsenal. Despite the ugly nature of the wholesale sales tax, it is the most politically convenient revenue raiser for the Government to use because it is a hidden tax which the Government can expand by stealth.

So it looks like this country will get a GST in one form or another, whether it likes it or not, as the honourable member for Mitchell (Mr Cadman) pointed out by way of an interjection a while ago.

There is a range of tax compliance and enforcement measures that can be used to extract further revenue from the existing tax base without having to raise or expand the scope of existing taxes. Some of these measures have already been put in place following last year's Budget.

Reforms based on that program included building flexibility and devolution into Commonwealth purchasing. The critical element in these reforms was new guidelines setting value for money as the basis for all Commonwealth purchasing. These principles are consistent with Professor Porter's analysis. They aim to stimulate industry sectors to improve their competitiveness and thus their performance.

         The job does not stop there. In 1993 the Government is implementing major reforms. Following the review of Purchasing Australia by the Australian National Audit Office, a major new training program, the national training initiative, is being initiated to improve competencies in procurement for government buyers. This includes conducting seminars to educate managers and supervisors, funding of additional places for buyers in current programs and an additional advance course in buying. The Australian National Audit Office predicts that those changes aimed at in this program could bring about additional savings of up to $8 million gross per annum.

         An integral part of this education process in purchasing is the establishment of widely researched procurement competencies. These competencies are being developed by Purchasing Australia in conjunction with the Joint Australian Public Service Training Council. Purchasing Australia is a department within DAS of some 250 people who have not only the expertise but also the ability—they have seminars such as Meet the Buyers—to bring together a package that has certainly seen a progress of change and reform in recent years. It is also, in accordance with the micro-economic reform policies of the Government, working towards nationally consistent purchasing policies through the national supply group.

         Quality assurance is another major strategy promoting more competitive industry. In May 1992 the policy on quality assurance in Commonwealth purchasing was launched by the then Minister for Administrative Services, Senator Bolkus. As this policy is implemented, Commonwealth purchasing will, in appropriate cases, identify minimum quality standards for supply to the Commonwealth and will, in those instances, require these to be met. This policy stance recognises that, internationally, suppliers of goods and services are being required now to meet quality standards.

         In Professor Porter's terms, the Commonwealth is seeking to become a demanding buyer in an area which is vital to the future international competitiveness of suppliers. At the same time, purchasing has an ability to lead providers of goods and services towards provision of internationally competitive merchandise. These are vital goals for our national economic reform and I look forward to working with the Department of the Arts and Administrative Services to achieve these. I commend the Bills to the House.

In Question Time and in the MPI we dealt at length with the question of why they were not required to pay the five per cent deposit that is normally required in these situations. We did not get then the answer to that question. I assume that the Minister, with his departmental investigation which is going on, may eventually give us the answer. But certainly it has become quite evident that no experience is necessary to apply for a licence to operate pay television.

Previous audit reports indeed have highlighted the deficiencies in the operation of Austudy by the Department of Employment, Education and Training, which is a very big expenditure item for this Government.

         We know that the Government's main strategy with a lot of these unemployment programs has been to go to great lengths to get people off unemployment benefits as quickly as possible and into some program of some sort. Whilst that of itself might be commendable, and we certainly want to support getting people off unemployment benefits, in the Government's headlong rush into cooking up schemes to do that—I guess to save it the embarrassment of the unemployment queue consistently growing as it has done—some of these schemes have left a lot to be desired of themselves and certainly the administration of them has left even more to be desired. In this case, the people employed by this firm were only given a few weeks work and were put off.

Apparently the superficial answer is that there were certain up-front costs involved in setting up to take on all these additional people. That may be so, but surely in this case the company's financial viability ought to have been checked out. If that rings a bell, it probably takes us right back full circle to the pay TV deal, except that in this case the shoe is on the other foot.

         One other instance came to my attention recently involving another of these schemes to get unemployed people off the dole queue. In some respects this example is rather amusing, but it alarmed a number of my constituents and I must say that I share their alarm. This one apparently came under the new enterprise scheme aided and abetted by the Queensland State Government's self-employed venture scheme. This was a considerable grant of money to an unemployed 41-year-old astrologer by the name of Ms Alex Grew. Ms Grew was one of 26 unemployed Queenslanders who were granted three-year interest-free loans of up to $12,000 and guaranteed wages of up to $13,260 a year to set up an astrology business in North Queensland. I do not know how seriously honourable members take the stars that appear in the newspapers each night.

         Perhaps one could take that lightly, and I have asked the question: where does this Government draw the line? For instance, would this Government fund an unemployed person who wanted to set up a business in fortune telling or tea-leaf reading?

         One item in this context was worthwhile—actually, it was mentioned yesterday in the Governor-General's speech—and that is the Government's intention to introduce a provisional age pension. Today in Question Time the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) mentioned that this pension would be extended to people over 60 years of age who were long-term unemployed. For a long time there has been very genuine concern in the current economic climate—which is of the Government's making—that those people were finding it impossible to get work. I accept that in those circumstances we need to be realistic about the fact that it is quite ridiculous for long-term unemployed males over 60 years of age to be going around trying to comply with work tests, knocking on doors and fronting up to the CES regularly and saying, `Look, I have been looking for work but I'm getting knocked back'. Of course they are being knocked back, and we have to be realistic about that.

         I am pleased that the Government is going to look at a scheme like this. Admittedly, it is not the solution to the actual problem of unemployment, but at least it is taking a realistic approach to those males over 60 years of age who, of course, cannot get the age pension and who, until now, were required to stay on some form of Jobsearch or Jobtrain allowance. Often these people are the worst affected by the recession and many members of parliament have seen people of 61 or 62 years of age who are demeaned by having to knock on doors and then come back to the CES and say, `Look, I have been out all day knocking on doors; nobody will give me a job. I still qualify for Jobsearch'. Clearly, that is not a satisfactory situation. Ideally, if the economy were buoyant, then they might be able to get jobs. That would be the best solution for them and, of course, for us as well, but it is not the case and I think this is a realistic approach.

         The fact is that the blow-out of costs in this area is a product of the system which the Government itself has created. The increased use of child care is not a result of perceived child welfare or parental preference; rather, it is a result of the economic pressure upon families. These economic pressures—and once again we lay the blame for those economic pressures where they belong, at the feet of this Government—have made it increasingly difficult for families to survive on one income and therefore pursue their preferred form of child care, that is, child care by a parent. Let there be no doubt about that, because all of the surveys which have been done have shown that the vast majority of respondents to proper surveys and research have indicated that child care by a parent would be the preference, given the choice. That is what this issue is about. Given the choice, families would prefer one parent and, in most cases for a number of reasons that I do not have time to go into, that would be the mother. They would take the option of staying home and providing their own child care.

         Of course, in many cases it is not possible for families to take that option these days. Economic pressures have created a situation where both parents have to go out to work. This Government has created that problem. Unfortunately, its solution to that problem is wrong. Recognising that that, per se, creates a need for child care, the Government has rushed headlong into providing inadequate child care. That again is a bandaid solution to the problem. It does not offer a choice at all.

         Indeed, this is mentioned a few times in the Governor-General's speech. It rings alarm bells for me when the Governor-General talks about the Government's concern about empowering women. Where does it all end? I recall that the Prime Minister mentioned again today his $30 home care allowance. Of course, what he did not tell us at the time he announced it—and what he did not say today—is that it replaces the dependent spouse rebate. It may well be politically appealing for that $30 to go to the carer as a home care allowance. In a sense, that is the right direction for it to go. I do not have a great problem with its replacing the dependent spouse allowance, although I would have preferred it if the Prime Minister had been honest about that when he announced it. It took us a little time to dig for the detail and find that that was just a little sleight of hand.

         In fairness, the $30 a week is actually $2.85 per week more than the maximum dependent spouse rebate.

On my figuring, that means that the family which is entitled to the full $30 would get an additional Big Mac per week. That is about what it is worth. I say `big deal' to that.

Yet every 2 1/2 or three years the Government and the Opposition put their policies before the people and the populace makes a judgment.

I was rather naive at the time—I possibly still am—but I thought that was the right thing to do; it certainly excited the large audience that was there that evening. I remember the late Jean Sinclair, a lovely person, berating me somewhat for having produced the shopping list during the Prime Minister's visit. But all those things for which I asked were eventually accomplished and tonight, since this is a somewhat wide-ranging debate, I would like to bring forward what some might refer to as a shopping list but which I refer to as some of the things that this Parliament needs to address.

         I have a vastly changed electorate now, and so naturally this shopping list is different from the last one—all the objectives of which were met. Employment remains my No. 1 priority; everything I mention here is underpinned by unemployment or employment. I want to refer to roads, and particularly our national highway. Stretching right through my electorate from Minmi through Beresfield, Woodberry, Tarro, Pelaw Main, Kurri, Cessnock, North Rothbury, Branxton, Greta, lower Belford up to Singleton, Muswellbrook and Scone, et cetera, we hope to have a fine national highway. But there are some hitches at the moment with linking up that highway as it passes through Newcastle from Morisset to Singleton.

         A great deal of money will have to be spent on that national highway to overcome the problems being encountered by all the people living in my electorate. There are some very dangerous sections of that road. As a result of the construction of the national highway, people in the Beresfield-Tarro-Woodberry area are virtually landlocked because it is impossible, due to traffic conditions, for them to get out of their townships. I want to congratulate the people of the Hunter for their patience regarding their road problems, but I give a firm assurance that that will be high on my list of priorities throughout this Government.

Over 700 grants have been made all over Australia, and I believe that there would be very few members in this House who have not benefited from a grant given to their constituencies by the sports Minister.

Coal is a great export earner and it is essential that we pursue a sensible strategy that will prevent sterilisation of national coal reserves and at the same time promote job opportunities for workers in the coalmining industry. That industry is having quite a few problems at the moment and we have had a succession of underground coalmine closures. That situation is most disturbing.

People are facing trials and tribulations far greater than they have had to face at any time in history. It is certainly a racking time for them, and I believe the situation has been further exacerbated by a lack of sympathy and even by the harsh treatment that they are receiving from some of the banks.

         This week's dreadful balance of payments figures showed that our economic problems are still serious and that the Government faces an enormous task. Just when we believed that the recession was over and happy times were here again, we blew it all by splurging $5.5 billion on imported goods. Many of these imports were productive goods, and necessary to bolster business growth and create jobs, but if our trade deficit continues to grow our nation will be in deep trouble. We are all aware of that.

         We fell into the tragedy of a recession because of our effort to hose down the booming economy. We were importing too much and a clampdown on imports was necessary. However, in a difficult and complex area our response was too heavy. We went a tad too far. But, unfortunately, it seems that we have not learnt sufficiently from our mistakes. To me it seems obvious that this Government will have to take stronger action to reduce the volume of imports we allow into this country. Honourable members might have guessed from that that I am not one of the economic rationalists and I am not a firm believer in the level playing field approach. It is true that one must be cautious when looking at just one month's figures, but a repeat of the March figure in April would make me very frightened indeed. Certainly, this week's figures dash my hopes of a further cut in interest rates. They do little to inspire investment confidence.

         I turn to our balance of payments problems. I believe that we allow too many opportunities to slip through our fingers. Just today I received a letter from a constituent of mine, a chap who lives at Weston in the city of Cessnock. He developed a sporting product which he wanted to have manufactured in Australia. It was a goer, a sure-fire winner; it had preorders from Australia and it had preorders from the USA—no question, a definite winner. The Government's message to all these inventors and guys who come up with innovative ideas is that, yes, there is assistance available, but my constituent did not gain assistance. After months on the bureaucratic roundabout, the treadmill or whatever you want to call it, months of total frustration, my constituent gave up and took his idea overseas.

When it comes to picking winners we certainly do not have a great record. I have sat on various committees and heard lengthy discussions about the difficulty in picking winners and deciding where government assistance should be directed. My view is that we could pick certain winners if we took note of the major imports and assisted people who were willing to produce in Australia those goods that we are currently importing. Additionally, this `clever country' should be capable of recognising innovative, money earning ideas when they come along. We must keep our good ideas and products in Australia; we must keep them in Australian hands. This is essential if we are to prosper.

         As we look back on the election I am sure that history will see it as an occasion of lost opportunity. This country lost the opportunity to make a new start. It lost the opportunity to put in place the sorts of policies of reform and change that are necessary to get our country going again. Even though we assemble in a new Parliament and the Australian Labor Party has been returned to office, the clear fact is that our country's problems have not gone away. Even after the election there are still one million people unemployed, a $16 billion Budget deficit, a $168 billion foreign debt, a huge balance of payments deficit, mounting social despair and community concern. None of those problems has gone away. Sadly, they are not likely to go away when we have a government that refuses to acknowledge that many of them even exist and which certainly has no program of action for the future.

         The Australian people chose some more of the same, rather than being prepared to grasp the reform agenda that was clearly necessary. If we are going to achieve our maximum capability as a country we really must do something about our unemployment problem. This must clearly be a priority objective. So many of the ambitions and hopes of our country will just never be achieved while people are unable to contribute from their talents and abilities towards building a stronger economy.

We must create the kind of business environment which encourages people to employ. The clear fact is that the fundamental elements of the coalition's reform agenda—those objectives that we put in place, those ideas that we had for the future to do something about the high levels of taxes on business, the need for industrial reform, the need for incentives to save and to invest, those sorts of issues—must be addressed.

There is no clear evidence that it has learnt the lessons of the election campaign, that it has learnt that the rejection that it received in the bush was a clear message that Australians are not satisfied with what has happened in the past and are looking for a more positive program for the future.

         Let us not just discard those as empty figures. A $13.8 billion deficit, if it were only to be that amount, would still mean that the Government is losing $1.5 million every hour of the year. Sadly, what it would also mean—and this is the telling statistic—is that every Australian worker will have to pay at least $2,000 in extra taxes some time in the future just to make up for this year's Budget deficit before we start doing anything about the future. So there is this regime of extra taxes ahead of every Australian worker because of the inability of the former Government—this Government—to manage its financial affairs.

         The first item I want to refer to is the $17.5 million in Appropriation Bill (No. 6) which is compensation to the States for the extension of fringe benefits to pensioners and long-term allowees and beneficiaries. That is, I believe, a worthy extension of benefits. The extension of fringe benefits to part pensions is something which we included in Fightback. It does address, at least in a small way, some of the inequities that exist in the current system. Major benefits are available to those who depend upon the social security system, but for those who scrimp and save and put aside to fund their own retirements, the fringe benefits are not available. So, when the Government announced that it was extending fringe benefits to part pensioners, that was something that I think was welcome and a positive step towards equity.

In all the factional deals he has missed out and he is not here to deliver on his promise.

I commented that that was a worthy initiative. However, it seems that many of the States are not honouring even the spirit of that arrangement. In December the then Acting Minister for Social Security, following a meeting in Perth, issued a press statement in which he proudly announced that 340,000 pensioners and 30,000 older long-term unemployed, sickness and special benefit recipients would obtain the fringe benefits. The statement quoted him as saying:

        Imagine after all that—after all that public announcement, and the sending of cards to every pensioner—when pensioners turned up to obtain the benefits that had been announced by the Commonwealth, they were simply not available.

There are other instances where benefits simply are not there—such as concessions on the registration of motor vehicles and electricity rebates.

         The second issue to which I refer is allocations to health. There can be no doubt that the health system, particularly in the State of Queensland, is in crisis. Morale is abysmal. There are widespread concerns everywhere people go. Prior to the election we were told that there were no such things as waiting lists at hospitals; that the 100,000 on the waiting queues, referred to by the Opposition, was a figment of its imagination. The reality is that those queues do exist. Last year 60 Australians died while on a hospital waiting list, waiting for surgery that the Government considers to be elective. Heart valve replacements and things of that nature are considered to be elective surgery. The problem is that this is occurring while 40 per cent of Australia's private hospital beds are empty.

         Last year I had a constituent—I will call him Mr O—who was on a waiting list for elective surgery. He required a small operation but he could not go back to work until he had had that operation. He was told that it was likely to take at least a year and a half before he could have that operation. He made the point to me that during that period he would be receiving sickness benefit at the expense of the Australian taxpayers. That would amount to tens of thousands of dollars while he was waiting for his operation. He suggested, `Why don't I go to the private hospital down the road, where they are only too happy to do this operation for the cost of a few hundred dollars, and I'll be able to get back into the work force quickly at a saving to the taxpayers?' I thought that was a pretty good idea so I wrote to the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Community Services (Mr Howe)—who, I notice, has just walked into the chamber—and I received a letter from his Parliamentary Secretary, saying:

What an extraordinary claim. Do we want equity of misery? Do we want everybody to be equal in extending hospital waiting queues? Surely it is important for us to take whatever opportunities are available to get minor operations—as it was in this particular case—out of the way so that people such as my constituent are able to go back to work.

         I had a similar case in the last few days. Mr R has a little piece of glass in his foot.

He moved from Townsville to southern Queensland in the hope that he could get to a place where the waiting list might be a little shorter. He asked the hospital recently how long he could be expected to wait to get that little piece of glass out of his foot and he was told that it would be at least another 10 months—all up, something like 2 1/2 years waiting for a tiny operation of that nature. He has calculated that in that time the Commonwealth—the taxpayers of Australia—will pay him $32,000 in sickness benefit while he is waiting for an operation which probably will not even keep him in hospital overnight. The taxpayers of Australia would prefer to pay $32,000 in sickness benefit rather than a couple of hundred dollars to a private hospital to get him advanced in the queue.

         But it is not just that waste of money; it is not just the $32,000 that the health Minister would prefer to waste. It is the loss of productivity: the fact that this man is not paying any income tax; he is not able to contribute to the work force; his employer has had to put somebody else on in his place rather than wait two years for this minor operation to occur. This is the kind of nonsense that our Government considers to be a health policy. Clearly, something needs to be done about it.

        Well, the $50 million has not done much good. A man with a little piece of glass in his foot is still waiting two years. If that is all the $50 million has achieved there clearly needs to be another look at the situation. The reality is that the coalition offered voters an alternative at the last election and bit by bit the Government will move in that direction. I noticed Senator Richardson making some comments recently about the importance of making better use of our national health resources. That can certainly be done to ensure that all Australians are able to gain access to quality health care at an affordable price and in a reasonable time.

         But there are other difficulties in the health system. In Queensland, as I mentioned earlier, morale is low. The Goss Government has increased health spending in Queensland by something like 50 per cent, but in the process it has closed scores of hospital beds across the State, sacked scores of nurses and slashed expenditure on services. The money has gone instead to create a massive health bureaucracy. Instead of there being one administration to run the health department, there are now 13 with money being squandered all over the place. The failed administrators from the Labor regimes in the southern States have moved to Queensland to try to do the same damage to our once strong economy. Money is spent on $300,000 houses for directors of regional health authorities while there is no money for maintenance on hospitals. The hospital system in Queensland was virtually closed down for three weeks over Easter as a cost saving mechanism. How serious is the Goss Government about reducing hospital waiting lists when it closed the hospitals for three weeks over Easter?

A considerable level of monitoring has been carried out on the condition of the Hawkesbury, but very little remedial action.

Because it lies between city and country it has some of the advantages and disadvantages of both.

         While the Prime Minister was speaking in the opening address yesterday, it struck me that it is worth considering this chamber, as has been said before, as the pressure cooker of Australian politics, and in many ways you are the safety valve. The point at which you choose to allow the chamber to let off steam, or to continue to cook, will determine how palatable—if you will pardon the analogy being taken too far—democracy is to the Australian people. The degree to which the chamber is unable to express various political views will create the sort of explosive situation that is always hazardous in pressure cooking, as I recall it as a young man.

         My point in rising to speak to Appropriation Bill (No. 5) 1992-93, Appropriation Bill (No. 6) 1992-93, Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 2) 1992-93, Supply Bill (No. 1) 1993-94, Supply Bill (No. 2) 1993-94 and Supply (Parliamentary Departments) Bill 1993-94 is to reflect for a moment on the package that the Opposition took to the electorate. While I have said in my congratulatory remarks that it is inevitable that there will be conflict and confrontation in this chamber, I think that the electors of Australia—at least those who are politically informed—understand that level of conflict and confrontation, and what they cannot, do not and should not accept is what they sometimes see emerging from this chamber, and that is a level of contempt for points of view put by people on the other side, regardless of which side we may sit.

         Much of the difficulty that we in the Opposition faced in the election campaign was not a reflection on the program we took to the people of Australia, it was not a reflection on the way it had been costed, it was not a reflection on the way in which it would meet the needs that Australians had, but it was a reflection on the level of contempt that the Prime Minister generated about what was otherwise a sensible program. As I rise to debate these Bills I am astonished at the degree to which they fill part of the Government's objective to be populist.

They were the ones who early cried caution when the State Bank became so exposed to groups such as Equiticorp and the Remm Group; who early cried caution when the State Bank's bad debt schedule blew out to $6.8 million, and the recovery for that year was only $97,000, when the normal recovery in bad debt transactions is expected to be about 50 per cent. They were the ones who shouted alarm about this default level and who, for shouting that alarm, were treated with scorn, derision and contempt by the Parliament of South Australia, the Government of South Australia and, by implication, the majority of the people of South Australia. In many ways, I am sorry to participate in this debate because this debate on the Appropriation Bill (No. 6) marks the demise of South Australia under an ALP government.

         What is of concern to everyone in the Parliament is what has happened to the wool industry right across this nation. The wool industry is a classic illustration of precisely what has marked the balance of payments figure that we had announced today, because what the nation most desperately needs is exports and what the nation in fact is suffering is a fall-off in exports, particularly in agricultural areas.

Let us look at what has happened to farming in Australia in recent times. Of real concern is not just the fall in farm income that is known to everybody, but the difficulty that farmers now face in the replacement of plant and machinery because of decreasing farm receipts over the past 10 years.

        The Farmfacts Survey of 1990 showed that there has been very little investment in plant or equipment . . . during the past decade. As a result, standard depreciation calculations grossly underestimate the cost of replacing such items. A survey of 40 Farmfacts farmers estimated the real annual replacement cost of machinery as being $33.33 a hectare. This figure was calculated using the formula: annual replacement cost . . . for each item. The `new value' was taken as the cost of the equivalent item, so that second-hand values were used where appropriate. This figure did not include private vehicles, although these should be regarded as essential management equipment.

         Appropriation Bill (No. 6), which we are dealing with tonight, targets most of that $44.6 million to non-viable rather than viable farmers. There is a desperate need for viable farmers to be given some opportunity to continue in farming. Mr Speaker, having been chairman of the banking inquiry, you are conscious of the degree to which the present lending regime has made it very difficult for farmers to either continue farming or provide sufficient replacement plant and machinery. This Government faces the challenge of picking up and accelerating the initiatives the Government announced in the last Budget when it suggested there ought to be an opportunity in rural Australia for debt write-off, and as a representative of a rural electorate I cannot stress strongly enough the need for the Government to accelerate negotiations with the banks. This is an area you, Mr Speaker, understand well—the proposed, but as yet largely unrealised, debt write-off program.

In that context, Mr Speaker, I put it to you that the Opposition has maintained a consistent line, endeavouring to encourage the Government whenever the Government itself has been part of a program that made it easier for exporters in Australia to be export oriented. We will continue to do that. As yesterday's figures indicate, we as a nation have no choice but to have a more aggressive export program. The Opposition supports that course. As the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) pointed out, we do not oppose the Supply Bills currently before the House, but we are critical of the way in which the Government is currently using these Bills merely to fund some of the largesse that it used during the last election program.

This short-sightedness is indicative of a man who cannot see his own feet; he will not match the federal offer and allow coastal business to profit by the increased trade.

In fact, in the instance of Telecom Australia, if market forces were allowed to operate there would never have been nor would there be a second telecommunications carrier, as it would not be able to compete with what was the most efficient telecommunications organisation in the world bar none.

         Another saying comes to mind: `If it ain't broke, don't fix it'. The second glaring example was the privatisation of the GIO in New South Wales by those financial whizzes also responsible for Homefund. In the midst of a significant economic downturn, GIO delivered over $100 million to the New South Wales State coffers. What did defenders of the free market do? Firstly, they forced people to insure with private insurers. These, the self-confessed advocates of free choice, refused to allow me to choose GIO, then they floated and sold this valuable long-term asset to sort out their financial mismanagement. There is a jealousy from those in the private sector when they see a significant income stream that they cannot get their dirty little hands on.

         I must state that I am unashamedly anti-nuclear by persuasion. I would therefore urge the Government not to seek the building of another reactor and to decommission the Lucas Heights reactor. Let us take a strong stand like the Lange Labour Government in New Zealand that banned the entry of immoral nuclear armed and/or powered ships to its ports. It goes without saying that I therefore object to the suggestion of mooring such vessels in Jervis Bay and will resist such actions to the extent that I am capable. The notion peddled by the Navy that any vessel having trouble at such a mooring would be towed 40 kilometres out to sea is fiction. I am tempted to use another term but will refrain. Anyone speaking honestly on either side of the argument knows that if there was a serious accident the ship would be immediately encased in concrete on-site. No-one, not even I with the great love I have for Jervis Bay, would or could see such a vessel taken out to sea to jeopardise the whole east coast of Australia.

It is true, but it far underscores the contribution made by Dame Mary Gilmore to the fabric of Australian life. It also points to another feature of Australian life which must change. Young women in Australia are led to believe that role models do not exist in our history. This is garbage, and largely the established media are to blame. Strong women have struggled to improve the lot of fellow Australians. They have stood their ground against the forces of evil motivated by profit and greed—and we know who they are—and they have been ordinary women of Australia but who have achieved extraordinary feats. Dame Mary Gilmore was one such woman, but most of the families of those on this side of the House are filled with such women. We know their history; we know their struggles. To list Dame Mary Gilmore as just a poet is an insult to her, to the Labor movement she devoted her life to, to journalism which she brought some honesty to, to socialism which was her undying credo and to all Australian women who have been cheated of their legitimate role in Australian history.

         Mr Speaker, these Bills are a continuation of the policy directions set in concrete by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) both as Treasurer throughout the 1980s and then as Prime Minister. The people of Australia had the right to wake up on 14 March to a new era of hope. The election had been fought and won, and lost. Instead, Australia woke up with a massive hangover in the form of a Labor government with no mandate.

         The Government did not contest the election on the basis of any vision, promise or hope for Australians but merely on the policies of the Opposition through a campaign of fear and deception. After Australians had woken up on 14 March, what had changed? Nothing! The trends simply continue: Australia still has record unemployment; we still have record Budget deficits, to which these Bills add; we still have a record foreign debt—from $23 billion to $206 billion in the space of 13 years—we still have record bankruptcies, a record current account deficit, no growth in the economy and no business confidence. But the fact is that the Government is still there and so are the problems that the election should have been fought on. That should have been the focus of the Australian people.

         I would like to issue a challenge to honourable members opposite: show me anywhere the Prime Minister stated that inflation policy was a priority objective before the onset of the recession. The record shows that the current account deficit policy response by the Prime Minister, then Treasurer, was to raise interest rates, supposedly to soak up excess demand for imports. We were told that if people had less money in their pockets they would spend less on imports. There was no mention of inflation; it was simply to soak up excess demand for imports.

         This policy response to our current account deficit crisis in 1990 proved conclusively that Labor cannot manage money; it does not understand business. There has never been a financially successful Labor Government in our history. I remind this House of the Whitlam era in which we saw financial irresponsibility and the printing of money by the Treasurer, Dr Cairns, as a policy response; the Wran-Unsworth governments; and the Cain-Kirner disaster in Victoria. My colleague the honourable member for Wakefield (Mr Andrew) has already covered the Bannon-State Bank of South Australia fiasco and I am sure my colleagues will cover WA Inc. before this debate is finished. The Queensland Goss Government is headed along the same path of financial disaster; there is no question about it. The Goss Government inherited a government that was fiscally sound and it is on the way to taking that State to where other Labor States have finished up. It has simply not yet had enough time.

         Tragically, the Hawke-Keating era will top all previous Labor disasters, if it has not already done so. In the past three years this nation has taken a massive nosedive into an economic and social crisis, but the wheel has turned the full cycle. The current account deficit crisis led to record interest rates to soak up consumption demands for imports, as I said before. But that policy also soaked up demand for locally produced goods, which then plunged us into a recession. Remember the Prime Minister's prophetic words—`There will be no recession'. After that he said, `This is the recession we had to have'. There are one million people unemployed, we have galloping foreign debt and business bankruptcies. Nothing has changed; we are back where we started.

My colleague the honourable member for Higgins (Mr Costello) spoke earlier tonight about the fiscal turnaround of over $33 billion. But where does the Government go to from here? How does it address the problems of unemployment, growth, debt, exports and imports, and Budget deficits? No matter how many diversions the Prime Minister creates, the big problems will not go away.

As my colleagues said earlier tonight, the Prime Minister has boasted many times that he had his hands on all the levers. The one lever that he did not have his hands on was the power of the trade union movement which, in fact, took away many of his policy options in dealing with Australia's economic problems.

         How will the Government address the immediate problem of the current account deficit? Will it put interest rates up again to soak up consumption demand for imports? Can that be done now in the context of Australia's economy today? What will be the effects of the Government's legislated tax cuts on the demand for imports? I suggest that it will surely have an adverse affect on the current account. In a situation where the Government has a current account deficit, if it is putting more money into people's pockets, that is the opposite of what it tried to achieve with interest rates in early 1990 and will have an adverse effect on the current account.

         If the Government uses interest rates again, will that not create even more unemployment and business failures? What is the Government's answer to its foreign debt? It is already borrowing money to pay its interest bill. It cannot do it through asset sales; I think the Government is running rapidly out of assets to sell. But any business that sells an asset does so to reduce debt and the debt servicing costs. Business does not sell assets to prop up cash flow. This Government does. The asset sales have been used for cash flow. They should have been used for reducing debt.

All the local members appreciate that our economic base, centred on coal and steel, has been too narrow, and we are working towards overcoming this. But the New South Wales State Government is determined that the Illawarra region will not prosper. The New South Wales Liberal Government has systematically withdrawn facilities and work from the Illawarra region. Much of this has been placed in the State electorate, immediately to the west of the Illawarra area, and this just coincidentally happens to be the electorate of the current New South Wales Liberal Premier.

         This case will set an unbelievable precedent. If the case goes to the court and the union movement loses in the Magistrate's Court, a precedent will be set.

It is a crazy situation. The New South Wales State Government should ensure that some sanity prevails in the system. It should get itself together and stop this nonsense before there is industrial chaos in the whole Illawarra region.

         The Keating Labor Government during its term of office must repeal sections 45D and 45E of the Trade Practices Act. It is totally inappropriate, in my view, for criminal charges to be brought against people carrying out normal trade union activities. Those on the other side of the House who are always talking about threats from the Left conveniently overlook the threats imposed by the Right of this country, especially against trade unions, treating trade union officials as criminals.

         It amazes me that late last year Senator Powell, former leader of the Democrats—the marshmallows—when proposing a private member's Bill proposed the repeal of sections 45D and 45E yet, when she was Leader of the Democrats, when she had the power to repeal this legislation, she did absolutely nothing. I do not think that the good Senator Powell even discovered sections 45D and 45E until after she lost the leadership of the Australian Democrats. What amazes me about the Democrats is that, while some of their environmental policies may be very good, their policies on industrial relations are a disaster, and always on industrial relations matters they side with the hardline conservatives.

         Mr Deputy Speaker, I wish to advert in my remarks to where Australia is at the moment and what Australians view as their future. We have had within the last couple of days a record deficit of $2.1 billion. That seems to indicate that all the predictions prior to the election and during the election campaign were not right. That follows a March unadjusted deficit of $1.9 billion and in February an adjusted deficit of $861 million.

         This is a huge debt that Australia is running up. It seems to me from just assessing those figures that somehow or other the real impact of the deficit is being held back and delayed slightly, sufficient to see us over the election period. Now we are seeing in fact and in detail the true impact of where Australia stands in its relationship to the rest of the world.

         In the nine months of the financial year 1992-93, the current account deficit has reached $11.9 billion compared with $9.05 billion at the same time last year. We are now more in debt than we were at this time last year. What is the Government going to do about this deficit?  All who listened to the speech of the Governor-General yesterday would agree that there is a whole bunch of `ifs' and `maybes' and `we will investigate'. It appears that the Government intends in the next Budget to severely reduce its commitments, to wield the axe, and to break practically every promise in the book. In looking at the commitments the Government has made in a period of less than 12 months from the Budget of 1991-92—the Budget carries forward into this year and projects expenditure and revenue for 1992-93—one would have to assume that there was a certain rigour with which the Government laid out the figures and, supported by Treasury, was able to do the sums.

         There were five financial decisions within the financial year—the Budget, the One Nation statement, the youth statement, the Aboriginal royal commission statement and the co-payment reversal. When one looks at what the Government has committed itself to and then adds on the cost of the policy launch plus other election commitments, one sees that the Government is expecting to spend a lot of money over the next four or five years. When one looks at the revenue that is expected during that time—in fact, where the Government will take money from people through taxation—we cannot add up the figures.

         a table for the benefit of the House. I know that tables are not allowed to be incorporated these days if it is too difficult to reproduce them. Instead, I will read a summary of expenditure for 1992-93 and the following four years. In the projected summary of expenditure laid out by the Government in the Budget of August last year in the five areas, one sees that a total expenditure was predicted in this current financial year of $4,383 million, increasing to the following year. These are the additional on-top-of-the-Budget predictions. There is another $4.4 billion in the following year, $4 billion in the year 1995-96, and an additional $3.5 billion in the following year.

He praised the economy base of our Asian neighbours and in Washington he made a series of statements about our near neighbours and how well they were faring and what their savings programs were.

         —Mr Deputy Speaker, I am sure that if you were to advise the Parliamentary Secretary that he study his correspondence and that of the Treasurer he would see documentation of the very thing that I have spoken about. Insurance company after insurance company and superannuation group after superannuation group have presented to the Treasurer and asked for an explanation as to how the Government's policies help the average worker. The Parliamentary Secretary is beneath any of this consideration. In fact, he is so minor in the process of government that he would not even be exposed to some of these ideas. I assume that he makes his remarks out of sheer ignorance and blind and overenthusiastic commitment to a misguided policy of his government.

         Instead of examining the details, he has made an uninformed, unintelligent and perhaps misleading response. I would suggest that, despite what he has said earlier in this House about the value of superannuation to the average worker in Australia, he should look at the facts and find out how the average worker in Australia has been cheated by the process set in train by his Government, managed by the ACTU, endorsed by the ACTU, but bearing no benefit in the long term for the average worker. All that is held out for the average worker in Australia by the superannuation process espoused by the Parliamentary Secretary is greater cost to the employer and less and less benefit to the person who is employed.

         So the proposals from the Governor-General's speech about increased savings and benefits to the Australian community are fictional and a farce. They will not survive, and they will not be substantiated either over a period of time or in the short term. One can see that there has been no benefit in the period that this process of compulsory superannuation through the union movement has been adopted by the Government. If one doubles or trebles the process, all that means is an increased loss to employers and a decreased benefit to employees. One has to do some lateral thinking and get the trusteeship of the process away from the union movement and end the rip-off of the average worker in the so-called administrative process—

         —I just said that the principle he has put forward is one of misleading the House and the workers of Australia—which is much worse—as to the benefits that they will gain from superannuation. It is a hoax and a farce. The savings are not there. The Treasurer admits the savings are not there. He applauds the Asian community for the way in which it saves, and yet at the same time here in Australia savings are suffering. We do not save for a rainy day. In relation to compulsory savings and superannuation I could go through headline after headline over the last few days dealing with what the economists and the people who need to be read by the Government have to say. For instance, there is the headline from Ross Gittins which says, `Dawkins' call to save is not what it seems'. The headline by Ross Gittins is saying that what the Treasurer is calling for is not exactly what he is going to present.

         The benefit to the Australian family and the Australian worker needs to be assessed by this Government. It is not the hypothetical, intellectual exercise that we have seen presented by the ACTU or presented here in the Parliament. It is something more basic than that. People have to be relieved of costs on a daily and weekly budget so that they have funds to set aside for a rainy day and for their own future. They have to be relieved of the demands that the Government has placed on them through the tax system and the high cost of living as compared with our neighbours.

I do not agree with the Liberals on many issues but we need in Australia at least two parties with views that differ and with variations in philosophical ideals. We definitely do not need a party of extremists and zealots, a party which is ruled and manipulated by the driving force of ambition and greed.

He set up the Waste Watch Committee, and already he has started to find out some very interesting facts and figures about the Victorian State Government. Recently, the State Government in Victoria paid $2 million for lawyers in an attempt to stop Victorian workers from having federal awards; $1.6 million was spent on consultants' advice on legislation and advertising; and $2.35 million was spent on pay rises for MPs and on the appointment of four extra Ministers. Jeffrey Kennett is the man who was going to save Victoria millions. He is spending more on more Ministers. He has also created positions of Parliamentary Secretary. The people in these Parliamentary Secretary jobs are all fairly crucial people, out of whom he is trying to get votes to shore up his support. I do not know whether Jeff will be there for too long, but there is a lot of pressure on him from other people in the community.

         We all know about the $100,000 spent to have silver service back in the parliamentary dining room. This is the sort of guy who cuts out money to the Grey Sisters for respite care and for cot death research but spends $100,000 to get silver service in the parliamentary dining room. He removed $2.5 million from capital works for schools. The kids now have to empty out their own rubbish bins. And what does Jeffrey do? He sits up in the parliamentary dining room with his silver service.

These are the sorts of things going on in Victoria. This is the sort of thing that a liberal party does. Just imagine how it would have been had we lost the last election.

         The cuts in Victoria are putting a damper on the economy there. How would one feel were one a public servant, a nurse, a teacher or anyone in that area in Victoria who wanted to build an extension on their house or spend a bit of money on a new car or invest in some superannuation, insurance or something like that? They would not do it because they would not know whether they had a job. Why? Because Victoria is being `jeffed'. It is endangering the whole recovery of Australia. For a long time Victoria has been the engine room of Australia. It has the majority of factories; it produces the majority of manufactured bits and pieces. It is a hardworking State, but it has all been slowed down deliberately by Jeff Kennett and the people who support him.

         I would like to continue with Jeff Kennett but time is short and so I will move on to another area which concerns me, another thing that the State Government has done. It has allowed the installation of an oil terminal at Crib Point in Western Port Bay. Ships have been going up there carrying crude oil for many years. However, the Government is about to bring in some supertankers. Just imagine what would happen if one of those supertankers ran aground. The second biggest tourist potential in Australia would be wiped out. The fairy penguins would all be killed overnight. There is no way that we could stop an oil slick because of the high tides in Western Port Bay.

         Putting that aside, I was interested in the comments of the honourable member for Dunkley. He complains bitterly about the treatment that the people of Victoria are now getting from a government that is trying to fix up a mess. He worries about $100,000 in silver service but forgets that Joan Kirner and John Cain sold the trams and the railway carriages. They sold the lot. Instead of making a few decisions that were necessary  to rationalise an industry—rather than say to the conductors, `Look, I am sorry, the taxpayer can no longer afford you'—they sold the trams.

In its first three or four attempts the Budget went over because the Government had inherited a deficit. I think the first one was $10 billion. `It was all inherited', it said. But that got a bit thin after about the third attempt; it got up to $26 billion of borrowings. Then it had a couple of surpluses, which were as big a surprise to the Government as the deficits. It could not balance the books in a fit. It took no responsibility. Its policy was to get out there and win the votes; let the children pay, and that is what we are on again tonight.

         Do honourable members opposite know what percentage of a typical State budget is allocated to health and education? They would not know one figure in the existing Budget. But I can tell them that State by State two-thirds of their outlays is allocated to health and education. The State ends up having no money left, because it has sold the trams, the trains and the buses and it has mortgaged everything else in the country. What was the figure that came out the other day? It was $59 billion worth of debt, and that does not include the lease payments.

         I think it is reasonable in this appropriation debate to put a few facts on the record. A couple of hundred people attended this meeting. I took a white board along. I was not anticipating the appearance of the honourable member for Swan (Mr Beazley), but I was not too concerned about his appearance. What was supposed to be a reasonable opportunity for the racing industry to ask some questions and to get some straight answers was turned into a political bunfight. Why was it turned into a political bunfight? The then member for Stirling, whom Mr Deputy Speaker chose to congratulate the other day, had his entire staff in the audience. They would not know which end of a horse ate grass, and they had them on double time or overtime sitting in the audience to create trouble.

We had a bloke from the Seamen's Union in the front row with his binoculars. I said to him, `I bet you hired them to look like a racing identity'. It was a real joke. What is more, that is not where the 200 votes came from. There would not have been 10 people in the audience who lived in the electorate of the honourable member for Swan (Mr Beazley). I know that because, unlike other people, I know the racing industry. That industry just re-elected me to the committee with the highest possible vote. The simple fact is that I was there and I knew.

Irrespective of anything else, he would know how a GST works; he would know the fundamentals. The fundamental principle of the system is that the purchaser pays the tax.

The industry portfolio, which employs more than 13,000 people and whose outlays exceed $2.5 billion, is now administered by an energetic new Minister, my colleague the honourable member for Maribyrnong (Mr Griffiths), who has followed one of the most distinguished Ministers in previous Labor governments, Senator Button. I would like to record tonight my tribute to the outstanding contribution Senator Button made to Australia's industry, technology and commerce. As a result of his innovation and leadership, Australia now has a much more competitive and wealthy economy.

         Let it be said this evening that at the last election the majority of Australians rejected the coalition's industry policies, which were a recipe for economic ruin. It is a notorious fact that under previous conservative governments industry policy was limited to high tariffs and quotas that stunted growth of our export industries. This led to unkind comparisons that under a conservative government the economic performance of Australia in terms of export profile was akin to that of a developing country. The National Party had a hand in this with its agrarian socialist policies which, in the end, caused great damage to primary industry in this country.

Fightback laid it all out on the table and showed clearly that the Liberal and National party leadership ignored the cost to industry of rapid and radical changes in policy. The Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) and his then deputy, the honourable member for Flinders (Mr Reith) seemed to pay no heed to the institutional and industrial structure of our nation. As the Chief Executive of Toyota Australia said, the leadership in the Opposition was not listening.

         In contrast to the Opposition's policy in this area, the Government's policy seeks the establishment of an internationally competitive Australian industry by working with industry and our institutional structures. The Department of Industry, Technology and Regional Development has established sectoral programs covering industries such as pharmaceuticals, information and telecommunications, aerospace, agri-food, advanced manufacturing technology and service industries. These programs are not protectionist in nature but are focused on overcoming the access barriers to international markets. Hand in hand with the Government's policy on reducing tariffs, these programs are developing the international competitiveness of Australian industry. These strategies also seek to bring together with industry the nation's scientific and technological expertise in the universities and government research institutions such as CSIRO.

Indeed, there are countless examples of that not only in my electorate but also in most electorates in Australia. Over the last 10 years a host of new markets for our products have been established and new export industries developed. In the last five years, since the information industry strategy was announced, the information trade deficit has declined by $500 million from 1987-88 to 1991-92, with exports increasing 65 per cent over this period from $800 million in 1987-88 to $1,322 million in 1991-92. In the automotive sector, Toyota is investing $450 million in a new plant in Altona, Victoria.

As far as I am concerned, she has betrayed the women of Australia, and I will tell honourable members why. I have been very interested in the women's movement for a long time. I was on status of women committees trying to get equal pay for women—opposed by the unions, I might say, in Queensland—30 years ago. Quentin was not doing that in those days.

         The best solution is the one that creates jobs. Governments do not create wealth. Private enterprise creates wealth.

It had only rhetoric from the previous Minister and he did as well in that portfolio as he doing in his present portfolio with pay TV. He is just messing up on a grander scale these days. This country has no solution being presented to it by this bankrupt Government.

My political leanings were established in a working class family. My father, Alby Griffin, instilled in me from an early age three basic reference points to guide my political life: firstly, an understanding that the working people of this country are in need of the political representations that the Labor Party continues to provide; secondly, that the union movement is crucial to the advancement of the working conditions of ordinary Australians; and, thirdly, that if you do not stand up for yourself you cannot expect someone else to stand up and do it for you.

Whatever our faults, the Labor Party is vital to the defence of the less well off in our society.

         The role of trade unions in Australian society has engendered considerable debate and controversy since their inception. However, as one who grew up surrounded by active rank and file unionists the need for trade unions to defend workers from the excesses of some employers was and is abundantly clear. Unions have been essential in the ongoing struggle to improve wages and conditions throughout the work force. Their work is a crucial part of our society's necessary checks and balances against the unrestrained free market kill or be killed approach embraced by many of the members opposite.

Corinella extends from the Melbourne suburbs of Noble Park and Keysborough, through the rapidly developing area of the shire of Cranbourne and around Westernport Bay to Phillip Island. It is a diverse electorate in every sense of the word.Politically, on this occasion, the true believers in the metropolitan and former coal mining parts of the electorate triumphed over the tiger country that extends through south-west Gippsland.

         Corinella presents a great challenge to me as its local member, and to the Government. Key issues of urban and regional development must be addressed in the south-eastern growth corridor of Melbourne, and no doubt on the fringe of all our capital cities. Corinella is indicative of the problems to be faced and the challenges that must be met. As our cities grow and the pressure for our urban areas to expand increases, we have a responsibility to ensure that the people who are encouraged to move to these new suburbs are provided with the infrastructure and services that are necessary to make their living standards acceptable.

By long-term planning and the identification of what new communities need, they were able to facilitate successful urban development to cater for a massively increasing population. The Whitlam Government also sought to address similar problems, over 20 years later, through the Department of Urban and Regional Development.

         These Labor governments worked towards ensuring that the people who inhabited our fastest growing areas were provided with the necessary infrastructure.

Under the better cities program, this Government is demonstrating methods by which the growth of our cities can be tackled.

As further initiatives are enacted, such as the investment allowance proposal, I look forward to employment improving. However, the war on unemployment must be this Government's No. 1 priority. Without jobs, the social and economic dislocations to the community must be addressed. As one who was unemployed in the 1982 recession, I feel for these people who are directly and indirectly suffering. As we continue to move out of recession, and as our economy improves, we must be prepared, if necessary, to intervene further in the economy to attack unemployment.

         The Labor Government has made significant investment in education and training to equip this country with the labour force it needs to compete in the world economy. It is a fact that over the last 10 years this Government has made significant advances in the field of post-secondary education, with retention rates through to tertiary education increasing at unprecedented rates. However, even this success has produced new challenges for the future. Large parts of my electorate of Corinella still have very low levels of participation in tertiary education. The teenagers of areas such as the shire of Cranbourne will need further government assistance to ensure that they have the opportunity to further their education. I will be actively seeking greater government assistance for the development of further education options where they live.

         The recent election campaign provided a stark contrast between the platforms of the major parties. The coalition went to the electorate with a radical conservative program unprecedented in Australian Federal election campaigns. Without going into the obvious specifics, the basic tenets were massive cuts in government expenditure and services, and a withdrawal, or diminution at least, of government support in a wide range of areas, of which health care was probably the most contentious.

         In addition, the so-called freeing-up of Australia's industrial relations system was a glaring example of the laissez-faire ideological basis of the Opposition's program. In contrast, the Labor Government emphasised its concern for maintaining the Government's role in the economy, whether it be via Medicare, maintaining the safety net of the award system or a greater commitment to assistance for the unemployed, including job creating initiatives.

         On 13 March the Australian people made their decision—a wise decision. They endorsed the broad framework of Labor's program in comparison with the program of the Opposition. I know that in my electorate of Corinella the young families, the working people and many of those suffering under the debilitating pressure of unemployment endorsed Labor's program and the philosophy that is its base. They understand that the Government has a role to play in our economy, that we cannot leave people hanging out to dry without an award system and that access to an equitable health system is what they want and deserve.

         Prior to my election as the member for Corinella, I had the pleasure of being a councillor of the city of Springvale. Springvale is an extremely culturally diverse city, and a significant part of the city is in the top end of Corinella. In Springvale we are proud of our multicultural community, and the council is a strong supporter of multiculturalism. Springvale was also extremely fortunate to have a chief executive officer who provided innovative and progressive leadership until his untimely death. The late Ian Tatterson was a great leader in local government who could have played a major role at any level of government. I share his commitment to multiculturalism and to community services and his support for government programs such as the English as a second language program. I value the support I received from migrant communities within the electorate, and I pledge my continued support for government programs that assist them to be active participants in local communities and in the wider community generally.

I note the comments today of my colleague the Minister for Industry, Technology and Regional Development (Mr Griffiths) regarding promising developments in the food processing industry, as this will have important implications for local producers in the long term. I share four things with the Minister: a commitment to encourage the development of Australian industry; membership of the Australian Labor Party; support of the great Essendon football team; and an embarrassingly similar name. I am proud of three of these points, but I am quite sick of the confusion caused by the last one.

         —This really has not been a very good week for the Minister for Communications (Mr Beddall). We have had the pay television debacle before the Parliament this week, and now I have to put before the Parliament another mess the Minister is making in his own department. The communications group of the Department of Transport and Communications is proposing to close a number of its offices and to amalgamate their functions with other offices. Specifically, it proposes to close its Gold Coast operation before the end of this year, and the duties of that office in future are to be performed from Brisbane.

         Since its inception in 1986 the Gold Coast office has provided an excellent service to all users of the radio spectrum, including all services from CB and ships to complex radio systems. This decision defies all logic. All indications for the past seven years are that the Gold Coast office has been understaffed, not underworked. For example, the department has considered the Gold Coast a high density area, and has charged the appropriate fees. Further, the most recent Australian Bureau of Statistics figures indicate that the Gold Coast region's population is now more than 300,000 and that it is the fastest growing area in Australia. In fact, its population will be close to 500,000 by the end of this decade.

         There are approximately 10 radio service organisations currently operating on the Gold Coast and radio communications interference on their remote radio communications sites is a regular occurrence. To suggest that these problems can be resolved from an area remote from the site, an area which cannot even monitor the interference problem, is absurd. The intermittent nature of the problem requires continual monitoring. For the department to suggest that regular visits to the Gold Coast is sufficient to resolve these problems highlights a lack of understanding of the technical intricacies on the part of the decision makers.

         Staff will spend more time travelling between Brisbane and the Gold Coast than they will on the job. It is not unusual for traffic hold-ups to delay trips from Brisbane and the Gold Coast for two to three hours. It is an absolute nonsense to relocate the office. The spectrum density of radio communication services on the Gold Coast is the highest of any non-capital city and closure of the Gold Coast office will undoubtedly result in a reduction of standards.

         The information that has been put out by the department for some unexplained reason splits the number of Gold Coast licences between Southport and Coolangatta. There is, of course, only one Gold Coast office so this office is presently dealing with all of them. When one combines the numbers, one finds that the number of licences on the Gold Coast is equal to that in Brisbane, a city of more than one million people. In fact, the combined number of Gold Coast and Brisbane licences would equal the combined number for Sydney and Wollongong. That fact demonstrates that the Gold Coast is a major radio communications area.

         At present, there are only three areas with more licences than the Gold Coast. They are Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane, and the latter has only marginally more; they are approximately equal. So the Gold Coast is one of our major radio communications areas.
