        I move this motion on behalf of the Prime Minister (Mr Howard), who, along with the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley), is today attending the special Tasmanian memorial service in Hobart. Francois Mitterrand was a distinguished statesman and visionary leader. As President for 14 years, he stands alongside President de Gaulle as a key figure in the history of modern France. Mr Mitterrand's death, after a long illness which he bore with dignity and fortitude, was a profound loss for France, Europe and the world.

       <para first-indent="16">
        Francois Mitterrand once described politics as the art of judo—the art of nimbleness and the ability to surprise your opponent. In a political career which spanned almost 50 years, Mr Mitterrand proved himself a very skilled exponent of the art of politics as he defined it. He also brought to his political life the intellectual breadth and deep learning, enormous energy and sheer tenacity which made him not just a political survivor throughout those fifty years but a towering and influential figure in shaping the destiny of postwar France.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Elected to the French National Assembly in 1946, Mr Mitterrand soon after became, at the age of 30, a minister in President de Gaulle's first postwar government. He served in successive governments until 1958, when he broke with President de Gaulle. The next two
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         decades were dominated by his rebuilding and leadership of the Socialist Party, which provided the platform for his third and successful bid for the presidency in 1981. His easy victory of a second term in 1988 was a tribute both to his popularity and to his authoritative dominance of the French political scene. Having gone the rounds with such people as the famous French Foreign Minister Couvre de Meville, de Gaulle and others, he was subsequently elected twice as President of France.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        As is inevitably the case with such a long period in office, there are many different views and judgments about the achievements of Mr Mitterrand's two terms as President. But there is no doubt or disagreement about either the strength of his reforming zeal and of his commitment to social justice, or his pragmatic appreciation of economic realities as when, in 1983, he recognised the need to put aside his dream of `socialism in one country' and implemented an economic reform program based on fiscal restraint.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        There is also no doubt that Francois Mitterrand was one of the chief architects of European unity and that this will be his most significant and enduring legacy. Mr Mitterrand was first and foremost a Frenchman, with a passionate pride in, and commitment to, his country. But he had the vision to realise that the best guarantee for France's future rested not in the pursuit of a narrow nationalism, but in securing a leading role for France in bringing about a united and peaceful European community. To achieve this goal, he worked with passionate conviction and unrelenting determination to build a partnership between France and Germany, a country against which he had fought in his youth. His clasping of hands with German Chancellor Kohl in a cemetery at Verdun in 1983 symbolised not only the friendship of the two leaders, but also the new era of peaceful and effective cooperation between their two nations.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        While the goal of European unity was his major preoccupation, Mr Mitterrand also exercised active and constructive leadership to ensure a wider international role for France. He often took a direct and personal
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         interest, as when he flew to Sarajevo in 1992 to draw attention to the plight of Bosnia. He was a catalyst in achieving closer cooperation between Europe and the United States. Under his leadership, France played a leading role in seeking resolutions to the problems in Cambodia and the Middle East. He committed French troops to the Gulf War, and to peacekeeping operations in Rwanda, Bosnia and Somalia.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Mr Mitterrand also displayed far&amp;hyphen;sighted leadership in redefining France's role in the South Pacific. Under his presidency, France's enlightened policy of reconciliation with the indigenous peoples of France's overseas territories, especially through the Matignon Accords in New Caledonia, was a valuable initiative.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        For Australians, Francois Mitterrand will be remembered most warmly for his declaration in 1992 of a moratorium on French nuclear testing. His decision was much appreciated, especially in the South Pacific, and was a positive contribution towards the goal of nuclear non&amp;hyphen;proliferation. I am sure that Mr Mitterrand would have welcomed the recent signature by France of the South Pacific Nuclear Free Zone Treaty, and its commitment to sign the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty, when negotiated.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Mr Mitterrand was an outstanding politician and impressive individual. His many achievements have left a deep and lasting legacy, which will shape not only the future of France but also of Europe. I am sure that all members of this House join with me and the Prime Minister in expressing our deep condolences to Mr Mitterrand's family and the people of France. I commend this motion to the House.

         For the last 14 years he was the longest serving and only socialist President of the Fifth Republic and he will be remembered by the French people for many things—firstly, for the extraordinary political perseverance of a man who first entered government in 1944, was a minister 11 times between 1946 and 1957, and spent some years in the wilderness—twice running unsuccessfully for the presidency before finally entering the Elysee as President.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         He will be remembered as the man who forged the socialists into a united and effective party in the 1970s and 1980s—moving the party away from the large accumulation of Marxist dogma it then had toward the centre. He will be remembered for a flourishing period of domestic reform in the 1980s in human rights and social policy in particular—including the abolition of the death penalty, the protection of coloured immigrants in France, the curbing of police powers, the modernising of labour laws and the doubling of the national budget devoted to the arts.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         He will be remembered also by French people particularly for his extraordinary complexity—and the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer) has already commented on that—as the Vichy participant who became the Resistance leader; the very formal and reserved man, as I can personally testify, who was nonetheless a superb public orator; and the way in which he unpredictably changed political course from conservatism to socialism to, at the end, what could probably only be described as something in the middle. The Deputy Prime Minister referred to a judo characterisation, which is very apt. I always think of that famous quote of his: `My strategy is to have only tactics.'

         He will be remembered for the way in which he blew hot and cold on so many issues, which led Regis Debray to say on one famous occasion that at least that kept the lukewarm people away. They are the ways in which he will be remembered by the French, but of course he will also be remembered by the people of Europe as a whole as one of the prime architects of European union, holding closely, even in the sceptical 1990s, to his

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         He will also be remembered not only by the people of France and Europe but also by the people of the world in particular for two great legacies, the first of them being his cultural legacy—the series of massive building projects that changed the face, in ways that have only enhanced it, of unquestionably one of the world's loveliest cities, Paris. This included the reconstruction of the Louvre with I.M. Pei's glass pyramid as the centrepiece, the great modernistic arch at La Defence, the new Bastille Opera House and the new national library project. All are a magnificent testimony to his cultural vision.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         He will be remembered by the whole world for his contribution to a saner nuclear world. There were as always some twists and turns along the way. It has to be acknowledged that he opposed de Gaulle originally in the development of France's independent nuclear program then became one of that programs staunchest defenders.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         But then came his momentous decision in 1992 to impose a moratorium on French nuclear tests in the South Pacific—a decision which was absolutely crucial in developing the momentum that we are now seeing for a nuclear non&amp;hyphen;proliferation treaty consolidated and made indefinite in its scope and for a comprehensive test plan treaty which we all hope will be negotiated to its conclusion this year. Hopefully, ultimately, it will be the forerunner for the achievement of the complete elimination of nuclear weapons to which we are all in this House committed.

        The Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans) used the well known quote that Mr Mitterand's strategy was only to have tactics. Certainly if one reads the various biographies of Francois Mitterrand, whilst there may be a lot of confection in much of the work written about him in recent years, the theme of pragmatism is something that emerges through those works. He was a socialist president. When his government first came to office in the early 1980s it pursued social democratic, centre left policies and by the time he left office it had moved in the opposite direction—I suppose to be fair, in line with the general move in the intellectual debate around the world.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        He made a great contribution to European security and European peace through developing the relationship between France and Germany and always understood that the embrace between France and Germany was fundamental to the stability of Western Europe. He, along with Chancellor Helmut Kohl, was instrumental in designing and finally achieving the Treaty of Maastricht on European union in 1991. He also had a broader world vision as French presidents frequently do. He had a world vision for France, but a constructive vision for the national community. He involved France in the Gulf War coalition in a very constructive way and he committed French forces to peacekeeping operations in Rwanda, Bosnia and Somalia.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Under Mitterrand's presidency, France's bilateral relationship with Australia evolved in a very constructive way. There was, for example, the resolution, albeit for a limited period, of the difficult issue of New Caledonia through the signing of the Matignon Accords. As others have said, it was President Mitterrand, I believe in the face of pressure of local government elections or whatever, who imposed a moratorium on French nuclear testing in the South Pacific.
       </para>
       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        <para first-indent="16">
         France's agreement to limited reforms to the common agricultural policy of the European Union and to the conclusion of the Uruguay Round of the GATT was also an initiative of President Mitterrand's and, obviously, was also welcomed by our farmers who had suffered and who, let me say, continue to suffer under the weight of the common agricultural policy.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Australia and France under the Mitterand presidency collaborated successfully in a number of multilateral spheres, notably on Antarctica in which we both pursued successful joint diplomatic initiatives to protect the environment and to prohibit mining activity, and disarmament where there was close collaboration between Australia and France on the chemical weapons convention and a range of other similar issues. On Cambodia, as the  Deputy Leader of the Opposition would know better than I would, I understand we maintained a close dialogue with France during that period. There has also been a good record of cooperation in the South Pacific in areas such as development assistance, disaster relief, fisheries, surveillance and extensive defence contacts.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         So during the Mitterrand presidency the relationship between Australia and France developed very constructively. He was, therefore, from Australia's point of view an important president but, above all, he was a very significant figure in the history of modern France and one of the most significant of presidents in the life of the Fifth Republic. Mr Speaker, I extend my sympathy to President Mitterrand's widow, Danielle and also, on his passing, to the people of France.

         —Mr Speaker, I congratulate you on your appointment to your very high office. I also wish to add a few words to the condolence motion for President Mitterrand. I was very excited when Mitterrand achieved his goal of leading the socialist forces to power in France in 1981. In so many ways he became a symbol of the possibilities of what might be called the democratic socialist approach that later developed and flourished throughout Europe. Although it is true that Mitterrand began with a more conservative
         <break page="78" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          approach, there is no doubt that he became very committed to the idea that you could have a left&amp;hyphen;wing party which was committed to both the ideals of democracy and an egalitarian society. He saw that model as distinctively different from the Soviet system.
         </break>
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Throughout his life both in domestic politics in France and in foreign policy throughout France's relations with the Soviet Union, he took a very tough attitude towards Soviet communism. So here you had a president who was from the left and who believed very much in the ideals of democratic socialism but who had no illusions whatever about the totalitarian system of the Soviet Union and who therefore, generally speaking, supported the broader democratic forces throughout the world.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Interestingly, looking at Mitterrand's period in office, during the reign of his governments all of the difficulties, problems, contradictions and issues which social democratic parties faced were faced by his governments—and he faced them very squarely. Initially, he began with a socialisation program of nationalisation of enterprises as a way of ensuring significant control of the French economy. But he found that this process was not very successful, given that he also wanted links with the rest of Europe in a tight European Union. So, as a consequence of that, Mitterrand eventually abandoned that program and moved to a more centre&amp;hyphen;left program which allowed him to build bridges with the other nations of Europe and to strengthen the European Union.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        As the Deputy Leader of the Opposition (Mr Gareth Evans) said, his most enduring achievement was in his dream that France would be at the centre of a greater European Union. He was very much in favour of expanding the European Union and yet making the Union more meaningful. He very much supported the development of the European Parliament. Interestingly, for some time now the biggest grouping in the European Parliament has been the democratic socialists, with whom he had considerable links.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        So Mitterrand leaves a legacy of a man who believed very much in basic democratic socialist ideals and egalitarianism and who, nevertheless, was flexible in seeing that in the
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         modern world different policies may be required at different times to achieve those goals. He certainly looked for those goals, but whether you can say that he finally achieved them, only history will tell. There is no doubt that throughout all of the governments that he was involved with, Mitterrand was always trying to find solutions for the betterment of the people of France and, in particular, to achieve greater equality and justice within France itself.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Much has been said of his commitment to disarmament and to stopping French testing in the South Pacific. For us in Australia that was further confirmation of the basic decency of Mitterrand and his concern to have good relations with this part of the world. We can all look to the Mitterrand era as one in which the relations between Australia and France were very good.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        He, interestingly, very much loved and was committed to French culture. Nevertheless, he was an internationalist. He believed in important relations with the rest of Europe, with bringing together all the nations and cultures of Europe and, in that sense, he also appreciated others' cultures and others' points of view. I think Mitterrand was one of the important leaders of this century and we all mourn his passing.

         —I join with the other speakers today. As the member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous) indicated, Mitterrand's victory in 1981 was probably as interesting to my generation and the progressive wing of politics as a Thatcherite victory in Britain. As earlier speakers have remarked, he was a very complex person, a man who, in 1935, led demonstrations against foreign workers but, with his victory in the 1980s, increased their rights in France. In the Fourth Republic, when he was variously minister for veterans' affairs, overseas territories and the interior, Mitterrand was responsible for the first liberalisation of rights in colonial Africa but, at the same time, condoned the torture of FLN fighters in Algeria. That lead&amp;hyphen;up to 1981, after the rise in 1968, and his ability to re&amp;hyphen;establish the strength of the Socialist Party was, indeed, deeply inspiring to many of us. Only yesterday my father
         <break page="79" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
          remarked on the huge emotion in Paris when he arrived there on 10 May 1981 as Deputy Premier of New South Wales and on the exuberance of the French population at that change of the French political scape.

       <para first-indent="16">
        To my mind, Mitterrand was most crucial, as some speakers have alluded to, in the actual transformation of French Left politics. From the 1920s, the Left in France had been largely dominated by the pro&amp;hyphen;Stalinist Communist Party and their control of the major trade union federation, the CGT. Mitterrand had to walk a very narrow tightrope in essentially forming a socialist party that had credibility after its rather unfortunate history during the Fourth Republic. He was a man who had sacrificed himself by being one of the few on the left to strongly oppose the basic coup by de Gaulle and was to lose his seat as a result of that. He went into the wilderness and then, in 1971, became the first secretary of a party he had not previously been a member of, from a very small base.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        On the one hand, he had to increase the strength of the Socialist Party and, on the other, he had to try to bring the Communist Party into an electoral alliance. He succeeded in doing that by the joint program and, in that process, marginalised the French Communist Party as a force in France. Of course, the collapse of the Soviet Union and later events were to strengthen that trend, but that was his essential accomplishment—he made the French Socialist Party the major party of the Left.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The period from 1981 did have a lot of very essential social reforms: the abolition of the death penalty; the abolition of the rather draconian security court; and people have referred to the increase in the arts expenditure. Modern Paris has been transformed by many of the edifices that he was responsible for. One thing that has been left out and is crucial, and very contemporary in this country, is the question of centralisation of power. He essentially—very crucially—got rid of the authoritarian centralised Bonapartist leftovers. He abolished the prefecture system to a large degree—undermined it—and established local and regional government. Even in Australia

       Mr Speaker, I move this motion and further motions today against a backdrop where the coalition has been concerned for many years about declining standards in the Australian parliament. There is no question that there has been a lot of public concern about standards in the parliament and that has expressed itself in many ways. Accordingly, in the recent election campaign, the government flagged its intentions to introduce a series of measures by which we believe standards can be raised. It is also our view that, in addition to sensible procedural changes, the standards in parliament can be raised simply by a change of approach and attitude by the government of the day emanating from the Prime Minister.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       Mr Speaker, the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) made his views on this very clear when he addressed the House for the first time on the question of your election as Speaker. Today we follow up those first remarks by the Prime Minister in a more detailed way to put additional substance to the government's intentions in this regard. In doing so, let me also by way of preliminary remarks say that there can be no doubt about the backdrop by which we introduce these amendments. Let me remind people that it was a sad fact under the previous government that standards fell as low as they did.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       The previous Prime Minister, for example, said—I was in the chamber when he said it—that question time was a privilege extended by the executive to the parliament. That really was an incredible statement to make. In fact, it is a denial of one of the basic precepts of our democratic institution. These people, on the other side now, acquiesced in that. Until it is repudiated, I would have to say that it still represents their view. The same person, with the acquiescence of those opposite, once
       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        described the Senate as swill. That, again, is a basic denial of the rights of people to be represented in the Senate—and the Senate is one of the great creations of the Australian federal parliament, providing a wide diversity of views and giving people, particularly those in outer areas, an opportunity to be heard and to thereby fully participate in the democratic process.

The second refers to the broadcast rules, another of the Keating legacies which I will say more about in due course.

       Generally speaking, we chose when we were changing standing orders to refer those to the Procedure Committee. So we will be providing an opportunity tomorrow, when the standing orders get placed, for a gesture from the parliament as to whether there will be an assertion of the parliament over the executive by a reference of those standing order changes to the Procedure Committee.

       You could have knocked me over with a feather! As I will demonstrate, virtually all of the proposals we have for the parliament today come from the Procedure Committee.

The motions being put before the chair include various changes to the sitting times of the parliament.

       Unlike in the last parliament when we had this incredible and ridiculous system of rostering, under the Howard government all ministers, including the Prime Minister, will attend question time every day and be available to answer questions. It was a feature of the Keating administration that the rostered day off for ministers was introduced. We do not accept the rostered day off system—we never did. It is a denial of one of the essential traits of this place, that ministers must be accountable to the parliament.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       There is no doubt that the roster system removed an element of accountability in the proceedings of the House. As those who have been here for a number of years will know, when you have a minister on the run, part of having that minister accountable is the fact that they know the pressure is building on them. In a rostered day off situation, they know that if they can get through today, they have tomorrow off and they can sit in their offices, have a cup of tea and watch the proceedings on the monitor. You are making their lives easier than it is in the public interest for them to be. In making this change we make a significant change to the operation of the chamber and thereby enhance accountability of the executive to the parliament. So do not give me the message about accountability when you talk about the Procedure Committee.

        In respect of the change to question time timing, that is another of the Keating traits. It was a barely disguised ruse to take question time off the live broadcast. We have broad casts of the parliament as a result of the initiative of the Senate, where we pursued the matter and required the broadcasting of that chamber. The former Prime Minister and the former Leader of the House, the now Leader of the Opposition, Mr Beazley, were totally opposed to broadcasting the proceedings of this parliament. They did not want people to see the way they treated the parliament. They wanted to censor the proceedings of this parliament because there was such an adverse reaction from the public to the lowering of the standards under the previous administration. That was the fact of the matter. So we required the television broadcasting of the parliament.

       Those opposite refer to the Procedure Committee. Its advice on this matter was that question time should be no later than 2.30. So on this very first matter you acted against the recommendation of the Procedure Committee as part of your political device to deny people the opportunity to see a live broadcast of question time. So we are bringing back question time to 2 o'clock. I think that in itself will be a very useful measure to buttress our reforms to enhance accountability in the House.

That of course is a two-way street. If there is to be the cooperation of the opposition, there has to be the involvement of the opposition in procedures that come before it.

       The other area which we support is the changes to the broadcasting recommendations. As the Leader of the House has indicated, these were recommended by the Standing Committee on Procedure. We are not going to oppose those. However, the opposition does perceive significant difficulties associated with the proposed amendments to standing orders 40, 48A and 103. So we will be moving amendments to those particular aspects. In effect, what these amendments do in the suite of amendments that are before us is to alter the hours of sitting of the House principally by extending the sitting hours to 11 p.m. as distinct from 8 p.m. on Mondays and Tuesdays.

       Before I come to the argument about the Procedure Committee, let us just understand what we are achieving here. The net effect of the government's proposals is that, whilst the House would be required to be around, either in recess or sitting, for an extra 4&amp;half; hours a week, the actual gain in sitting time is only 1&amp;half; hours. That comes about because the changes mean no net gain in sitting hours on

For a net gain of 1&amp;half; hours, you are requiring the place to sit around for an extra 4&amp;half; hours. That comes about because we are required to be here for the hour and a half dinner break. Those who have experienced it know that it is very difficult to get out of the place and back within that time of an hour and a half. The requirement is essentially to be here for that time but then stay on to 11 o'clock.

       There are a number of reasons why we oppose this motion. The first item is on the agenda because we receive a lot of lecturing from the other side of the House about fiscal responsibility and cutting expenditure, but the costs associated with this little exercise are going to be very significant indeed. The members of staff and the support staff in the parliament that will have to be kept back to accommodate this arrangement are going to increase the cost of running this facility, this business, this House, significantly. I think it is an extravagance in those circumstances and particularly strange in an environment in which the government is, as I say, lecturing us constantly on the need to tighten up on spending.

       The second area goes to the impact on one's health. Past experience has shown that late sittings do have a deleterious impact on the health of members' staff. This point was alluded to by the member for Adelaide (Ms Worth) when this debate was on previously. She quoted Senator Herron—as we all know, a medical practitioner—on people's abilities to function when they are operating in the night-time hours as distinct from the daytime hours. We are not the only ones asserting it. There is an array of medical evidence that suggests it is a far more effective basis for operation to have people working in the daylight hours rather than being expected to continue fully up to date and fully operating late into the night.

        The third area of opposition is the impact it will have on families. We all know in this place that our families are affected whatever happens, whenever we sit. Whether we sit till 11 o'clock or not, we are away from them for most of the four days we are up here. But what about our support staff? Doesn't this government, which talks about the need for family based policies, have some regard to the impact that families are going to suffer by the fact that people who work here have to stay back for the extra time?

        The fourth area I draw your attention to is that when this was debated on a previous occasion it was the media that indicated that they would, as a result of the 8 o'clock change, be prepared to give more consideration and reportage to adjournment debates. I know you have a lot on your backbench. Maybe that has more to do with content, but I would have thought that, with those people on the backbench who want to get into the adjournment debate as a means of getting their points of view up, this is an important consideration for them to take on board.

        Finally, the most compelling reason for our amendments is: why change? The existing system works. It was originally referred to, as the Leader of the House has indicated, a standing committee which set the pattern of sitting hours that we now have. It took into account all the facts and reported on the adverse consequences. Whilst there was a dissenting report to that initial set of recommendations, the opposition committee members' part of that dissenting report did not oppose the change to the late night sittings from 11 o'clock back to 8 o'clock. That was the original report that determined the basis upon which we sit.

       <para first-indent="16">
        There was then a review, and that was contained in
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Time for review: bills, questions and working hours
        </emphasis>
        issued in June 1995. In that report, the committee noted that there was general acceptance of the new hours. The committee was reluctant to interfere with the pattern that was working well or to break the regularity of the 8 p.m. rise each day. The committee recommended that no change be made to the hours of sitting of the House. There was no dissenting report put to that.
        <break page="90" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         This was the opportunity for members to have made their submissions if they were complaining about it, but, as the Leader of the House indicated, only 12 submissions were received and there was essentially no dissent to the view that we should persist with the change.

        We heard the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) talk yesterday about the supremacy of the parliament over the executive. What we have here today is essentially an executive decision going against what the previous parliament determined. I would say that the sensible thing to do here is that, if the government has a claim for changing the hours, it should go back to the Procedure Committee. It should be referred back to the body that made the original decision, reviewed it and found it to be effective.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is for those reasons that the opposition is not prepared to support the proposed motion. We do propose amendments to the government's motion. In essence, these amendments, which have been circulated, do refer the issue of sitting hours to the Procedure Committee—the body that the Leader of the House so heavily relies on when it suits him to assert his other arguments for change, but not in this case. Secondly, because I do acknowledge the government's right to extend the sitting hours of the House—and this side of the House does—in the interim, pending the report of the Procedure Committee, to achieve that extra net 1&amp;half; hours, I believe we should add half an hour each to Monday, Tuesday and Wednesday.

       Let me conclude on this point: we are not opposing the bulk of what the government is proposing. We are opposed to the change in the sitting times and will move an amendment accordingly. We are not opposing the change to the broadcasting of proceedings contained in notice of motion No. 2. We are not opposing notice of motion No. 3, but I would be keen to hear the response by the Leader of the House, because our understanding from discussions is that government business which is listed for next Monday will only include the address-in&amp;hyphen;reply debate.

       The reality is that there is a huge challenge for this parliament to get some decent legislation through for the purpose of turning around a very damaged economy, to reduce the level of debt and to legislate in all the areas to ensure that Australia can take its place in the world by the turn of the century, so that our young people can maintain the living standards which have been propped up over the last 13 years by the simple process of borrowing money. That is a substantial legislative task. It is the responsibility of this House to allocate the necessary time to debate these matters. I can assure the opposition that if they do not want to participate in the debate there will be plenty of people on this side who will do so and who will make the appropriate contribution. That is why the time is needed—to do a job.

In fact, as you would remember, Mr Deputy Speaker, we had the Speaker of this House stand up one day and make recommendations to us which we as a parliament had authorised him to make; and the next day we had the Leader of the House, on the then Prime Minister's instructions, come in here and pull the rug out from under his own Speaker—a practice of course that is not unique to the Labor Party.

The spread of hours of the House probably does not matter all that much to the member for O'Connor. The member for O'Connor I do not think would mind if we sat here till midnight because he, among all members, has the simple expedient for getting around whenever the House sits: he just gets himself thrown out at question time whenever he has a pressing engagement.

        The opposition is putting to the government a proposal which will allow them the same quantum of hours but at a more livable time. The government made a lot of points during the election campaign about being in favour of families and about being in favour of a more friendly style. How can this place operate effectively if members who have brought their families to Canberra have to be locked up here until 11 o'clock at night? It seems like the government have this really bizarre attitude that they are going to turn this place into a big boarding school and that members could not be let out at 8 o'clock at night because that might lead to dancing or something. We think the government ought to consider the opposition's point of view on this issue.

After extensive consultation with staff, members of the opposition and everybody else, we brought in a report which was thrown out by the government of the day. In 1981 that committee was revived following the premature death of Senator John Knight at the age of 38.

I hope in future whenever the subject is debated again—and I am sure it will not be this year—that we might again canvass some of those options.

       The essence of this debate is far more important things. It is the matter of the parliamentary roster. I pay tribute to the member for Hotham (Mr Crean). I am pleased to see that he is the Manager of Opposition Business. I paid him this tribute before when he was a minister in the previous government: he was the only minister who, when conducting his own business in this chamber, took pains to meet the political and parliamentary niceties. It is a welcome change that we will have someone who acknowledges the importance of parliament running affairs for the Labor Party in this parliament. I am sure he is more than a little embarrassed by some of the things that he had to do and say today, but I hope that is an indication that over time government and opposition in this chamber will move forward to a better parliamentary procedure. The motion that the Leader of the
       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        House (Mr Reith) has put down today is a first step in that process.
       </break>
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       The first point is the matter of the question time roster. Many were the times when we were sitting on the other side of the House that the then Leader of the House, now the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley), got up and was wont to use as defence on things like the debacle of the question time roster we had: `Oh, but reforms were recommended in the Procedure Committee report.' In fact, only a minority of the reforms that were recommended in that report were implemented by the then government and we had bastardised versions of other recommendations.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       For the record, and for the interest particularly of new members, the then opposition, by consensus with the government on that occasion, did agree to a trial of a limited roster in question time. It was that on Mondays—and Mondays only—there would be a limited roster, on the understanding that if the opposition wanted to question a minister who was not on the roster it had the right to veto that minister's absence. So the opposition had the right to call for a minister who was rostered off—only on that Monday—to be in here to answer questions. That is all the roster was. We agreed under some pressure but wanting, maybe, to be reasonable, to free up question time a little, so that on the Monday of sitting weeks some ministers could be absent by agreement.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       However, there had to be consultation between government and opposition. The Leader of the House now, who was then the Manager of Opposition Business, is well aware of the fact—and would agree with me—that every now and then the then government used to come out with a new roster—never mind only for Mondays, but for the whole week. There was never any consultation by the government. It was a case of: `We'll fax it through to your office.' The Leader of the House agrees. That is as much consultation as there was. It was faxed to everybody else at exactly the same time and it was, simply, `like it or lump it'. There was no consultation. There was no to or fro between government and opposition. It was
       <break page="101" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
        just: `cop it sweet'. That was the record of the Labor government here.

      <para first-indent="16">
       The Howard government has now decided to scrap the roster because it was a mess, it was a debacle, it was an insult to the people of Australia. Question time is a critical time for government and opposition members to question the executive government. It is not the members who are important in this; it is the people on whose behalf they do the questioning, the people they represent—the people of Australia. Question time is a critical time in the operation of our whole parliamentary democracy. It is not for the benefit of opposition members or of government members but for the benefit of the people of Australia.

       I will make a quick reference to the previous 3 o'clock timing of question time versus the 2.30 timing which was recommended by the Procedure Committee and the 2 o'clock timing being proposed today. The 2.30 timing was an attempt at consensus and consideration. At the time that it appeared to be emerging that the committee was going to come to a 2.30 recommendation—and somehow these things had a way of appearing in print in the newspaper; we never did quite identify who was responsible for all those leaks, although I think if you read the debate you would have a fair idea who most of us thought it was. The ABC communicated with the committee and pointed out that if we had a 2.30 start to question time, and if we went the normal 45 minutes that the House then had for question time, we would be overlapping its children's program and that this had serious programming implications for it.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       I do not watch the ABC at 3 o'clock in the afternoon ever, whether parliament is sitting or not. It is a time when I am at work so I was not aware, as I am sure nearly all of the other members of the committee were not aware, of the ABC television programming imperatives at 3 o'clock. So we proceeded to a 2.30 recommendation in the knowledge that that would mean the truncation of the broadcasting of the House of Representatives, although we always hoped that the ABC might be prepared to shift a few minutes for

       So we had embarked on that procedure in ignorance of the ABC situation. The Keating government, in its party room, jettisoned the committee's recommendation of 2.30 and went for 3 o'clock, which it knew the ABC absolutely would not accept. It knew that there would be absolutely no room for manoeuvre and for broadcasting the House of Representatives question time, which prior to that time had been broadcast on alternate days with the Senate. So we had the situation where the Senate was then broadcast every day and we were broadcast at midnight, or 1 o'clock in the morning or something like that, apart from the little colour pieces that used to appear on the evening television news.

       So in moving back to 2 o'clock, the government has made a decision. The 2.30 time was proposed by the Procedure Committee out of consideration for ministers and ministers' commitments, to make it a little easier for them to attend question time than 2 o'clock did. This government has taken the one decision it is perfectly entitled to decide to take, that is, that ministers are going to have to be here at 2 o'clock. It is not asking for any leeway for its ministers. I do not see how anybody could possibly object if the government has decided to inflict on itself something that the Procedure Committee would have been a little kinder to it about.

       I also welcome the change in the second reading speech situation. For the benefit of members who were not here, there was a time, when it was moved that a bill be read a second time, that the minister would then give the second reading speech, that is, the speech to the parliament and to the public about the content of a bill that is being presented for debate together with its rationale. The debate would then be adjourned after

We had record low numbers of questions despite a record length of time for question time.

       When talking about extending sitting hours, it is not simply a question of what is best for the 148 members of the House of Representatives. What we are talking about is the effect that would have on the people who work within this building and service the needs of the 148 members of the House of Representatives. As many people are probably aware, the fact that people associated with the Department of the House of Representatives put together information for us about the day's proceedings and tidy up what actually happened during the course of the day means that, at 11 o'clock at night when the bells ring and members can go home or wherever else they might want to go, many of those people will have to remain here.

       I would also make a couple of suggestions to the Leader of the House which you have not picked up here, because I do not think that some of these changes you are suggesting go far enough.

       My colleague the honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) mentioned in passing the length of answers which ministers gave. Can I suggest to all newer members in this place that, if they have not already, they get hold of the standing orders and they read standing order 144 relevant to questions and 145 relevant to answers. You will see an amazing difference. The subtlety even escapes people in the media in this place, because 144 lists very carefully rules applying to questions. Taking it further and getting the

Time and time again the occupant of the Speaker's chair had his or her hands tied because of the procedures dictated by this place.

      <para first-indent="16">
       I say to the Leader of the House, because he was one that frequently took up those concerns with me when I was Speaker, it is time that we addressed that very seriously. The Procedure Committee in the past made recommendations about this. The Senate have actually acted on it—there is one minute for a question and, I think, four minutes for an answer. It is time that we looked at ourselves and asked whether a time limit is required in that respect. Or will we see, as part of the new approach in this place to government, those ministers on the front bench, when asked a series of very serious, far&amp;hyphen;reaching and searching questions by opposition, give relevant and short responses? Only time will tell. But it may well be that this is an issue we will revisit. It may well be, and it may not be too far down the track, that people on this side of the parliament will rise to seek the call from the Speaker to raise the issue of relevancy and the length of answers of ministers, just as they always have done. If we are to get this place to work a little more effectively, particularly at that time and especially now with the change to 2 o'clock when we will see a live broadcast of our question time, at least two days a week I would imagine, then maybe we need to clean up that part of our act as well.

So it had to be on for all the insomniacs at 1 a.m. the next day. Whether it goes to the question of one children's program upsetting another and competing needs, I am not sure.

       The other issue which I should mention where I said I did have a couple of suggestions—and I hope the Leader of the House is listening to this—is the fact that the second chamber may be put to better use. When this particular facility was put in place, the idea was that by establishing virtually a duplicate of the House of Representatives we might see non&amp;hyphen;contentious legislation, committee reports and others go there for consideration. I suggest to you, through you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that maybe that is something that can be revisited. Maybe a lot more material from the House could be referred to the second chamber, to the Main Committee, for consideration. In that way not only would we increase the time in which that particular body sits, but the amount of material, legislation, debates and other things that members are so concerned about might not be enacted through this place. If we are serious about giving ourselves time for debate, for serious issues to be considered here, then there is nothing wrong with that happening in the Main Committee. I just suggest to the Leader of the House that that might be something that he needs to look at. It may require some changes to the way in which that particular second chamber was established. I am not quite sure whether it would need changes to the standing orders, but perhaps it may.

       However, we do need to consider the occupational health and safety issues carefully. I suggest to you, Leader of the House, that you act on your convictions and act on what you always put to me when the roles were somewhat reversed in the last parliament. You should look at standing order 145 and see whether you are prepared to recommend some changes to the standing orders so that definitions of things such as the relevance of answers and length of answers are picked up. You should make some genuine suggestions as to how question time may improve even more. I understand that you have a genuine desire to do so, and I can only applaud that.

But at the end of the day, if we are serious about changing the way this place operates, I would hope that some of those suggestions gain favour from the government and are given serious consideration. The other proposals—such as changing standing order 150 to make ministerial replies 60 days—are excellent. I heartily concur with the other changes that you have proposed.

        If people lose confidence in our parliamentary system, the very future of our democracy is at risk. This place is supposed to be at the centre of our democratic system and, if people do not have confidence in the way we operate, they question the very reason for having a democracy and the way in which our representative system works. We need to be seen as hardworking, industrious, fair, responsible and efficient. Every member has a role to ensure that those standards are maintained.

        As I said before, the departure of the former Prime Minister will help in this regard. There are still plenty of vigorous debaters in this chamber. The current Prime Minister (Mr Howard), the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer) and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) have reputations—justly earned—for being outstanding contributors to this parliament but, fortunately, they do not regularly resort to the personal attacks, insults and bad language which characterised the former Prime Minister's performance. We must all make sure that we do not resort to silly name calling and making those idiotic comments that were sometimes made. By behaving better, we will be able to restore the public's confidence in this place.

        The proposed changes to the standing orders that are before the House at the present time make a substantial contribution towards improving the way in which this parliament functions. I particularly welcome the Prime Minister's assurance that all ministers will be present for question time. It really was demeaning for the former government when the

Are we going to have rostered days off for the shadow ministers? Are we going to have only half the shadow ministers turning up in spite of the fact that all the ministers are going to be present? I commend Prime Minister Howard on taking this initiative and restoring the accountability of the ministry to the parliament by ensuring that all ministers are present.

        It is very difficult for an opposition to mount a concerted attack on a minister who may be deficient in his or her administration if that minister does not turn up every second day. You could have a minister almost ready to fall on his or her sword, and then he or she goes away for a holiday. The momentum is lost by the next occasion. We on this side of the House are confident in our ministers' capacity to perform. They do not need to hide behind a bush every second day. They will be here to answer questions.

         Worthwhile suggestions often come from the other side and need to be incorporated in legislation. What has been happening in the parliament over the last six or so years is that this House has been used as a rubber stamp and the real, detailed consideration of legisla tion occurs in the other place. That has lowered the significance of debate in this chamber, but that will be restored if ministers are here, are prepared to take on board suggestions which are made during the debate on legislation and are prepared to make amendments where necessary in this place, rather than having the humiliation of having to accept amendments that are initiated in the Senate and then need to be reintroduced in this place.

       Mr Deputy Speaker Jenkins, I congratulate you on your election to your illustrious position. May I make the point which was made by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) yesterday that there is clearly a great expectation with the election of this new government, a government committed to improving the standards in this chamber—standards of behaviour; standards of debate; standards of processes; and, in the case of ministerial responsibility, standards of ministerial accountability to the chamber—that, as a consequence, what is happening today and what will happen in the next few days and weeks of the parliamentary session will be of great interest to the community. They will be watching us and saying, `Are we really going to get some changes or aren't we?'

       In looking at the government's proposed changes to the standing orders, I am very much encouraged in certain of the aspects. In particular, I am encouraged by the changes relating to question time, which is certainly a critical part of our working day. It is the part of the day which most people outside of the parliament get to see as far as media attention is concerned. It is the point at which the House of Representatives effectively works, or can or should work, because it is a time when members can direct questions straight to a minister about important matters relating to the administration of their portfolios.

       I wish to make a couple of comments in response to comments made earlier by the member for Watson (Mr Leo McLeay) in relation to earlier debates about the changes which were made in the last parliament, particularly to sitting hours. I was one of the authors of the minority report, as the member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) mentioned, that was published alongside the report of the Procedure Committee. We had some concerns about the way in which the sitting hours were being changed.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       There were certainly some strong concerns about the length of sitting hours. I recollect
       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        that Senator Herron, a very compelling person, a person of great standing in the medical community as well as now a minister of the Crown, had some very strong concerns about the health effects of sitting late. However, I am prepared, as I suppose a measure of trying to ensure this place works more effectively, to compromise. And it is a compromise: on Mondays and Tuesdays we will sit to 11 o'clock and the Wednesday and Thursday sittings times are being retained.
       </break>
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       That is something that I, as a member of this chamber, am prepared to accept. I certainly do not have any problems with the consultation process at this stage. There was certainly a fair bit of debate in the community about the changes that were necessary to make this chamber work more effectively. But if the Procedure Committee is to have an effective role—I particularly direct my remarks via you, Mr Deputy Speaker, to the Leader of the House (Mr Reith)—there has to be some acknowledgment by the government that all of the work of the Procedure Committee is not merely an exercise in futility. That certainly was the case in the previous government's term of office. It was certainly the case when I was a member of that committee.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       The member for Charlton (Mr Robert Brown), who is sitting nearby, was a very good chairman of that committee. I was very impressed with his chairmanship of the committee. I do not want to put words in his mouth, but at times I felt that he, too, felt utterly frustrated at times when we wanted to make changes and the then Keating government refused to make them.

       I am certainly keen to see the Procedure Committee become a very effective and integral part of our processes—so much so that I would like to see, for instance, one of the Independents have by right a position on that committee so that they are able to participate and ensure that the interests of independent members are also represented in relation to any changes.
      </para>

       Just as an aside in relation to sitting hours: I am conscious that no doubt the changes to sitting hours have a big impact on the catering arrangements here. I noticed yesterday's
       <break page="109" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
        circular to members mentioned there have been some substantial savings. I know they are part of the government's cost&amp;hyphen;cutting measures. I certainly hope these changes to sitting hours are not going to be called the Hyatt clauses. I imagine that it is important for a catering contractor to have members in the House at some stage in the evening so they will buy dinner in the dining rooms. I hope that is not the case. I suggest the changes are, as has been presented, designed to allow the government and of course the House of Representatives to operate more effectively.

      <para first-indent="16">
       Question time is absolutely critical, as I said earlier. The 3 p.m. starting time was wrong. The member for Moncrieff, the Deputy Speaker and I were critical of this. Interestingly, the 3 p.m. starting time effectively pushed the MPI off the scene as far as the media were concerned. In other words, there was no time between the MPI being staged and the electronic reporting of the day, particularly by television, for the MPI to be properly processed. So, if you were trying to launch an effective message in the MPI of the day, you could not count on any sort of television coverage whatsoever.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       That obviously suited the previous government because the MPI is often a vehicle for the opposition to raise during the day matters of importance and of course of note in the day&amp;hyphen;to&amp;hyphen;day running of a country. It is the only opportunity in some instances. Having that forced into oblivion as far as the media was concerned meant that an effective platform for proper scrutiny of ministerial responsibility was lost. I commend the Leader of the House for reintroducing the start of question time at 2 p.m. I think that is a very good change, and the government is to be congratulated.

But it has become an effective forum for members to raise their concerns—particularly in the very important take note debates, which have now become a very good medium. For those new members contemplating their participation in debates in the future, I suggest that they look for these take note debates.

       There are, though, a few matters that I want to get on the record in connection with these proposals. I appreciate the fact that at the start of a new parliament of this kind, when there has been quite a substantial change, there are time factors involved in the government getting legislation and motions into place. But I just want to put on record my concern, and it is a concern that should be shared particularly by new government members.

        Until yesterday we saw these proposals only by way of a press release dated 31 March. I hope this will not be a government by press release. It is not fair to the opposition and it is not fair to government members. In connection with that matter it is important to draw attention to the fact that, since they did appear in this way, quite clearly they were not matters that were considered by the government parties. They may have been, but it is most unlikely that they were. It is most unlikely that the government parties endorsed all of the proposals in this motion and those which are to follow.

        I want to do two things in connection with those reports. Firstly, I want to draw attention to the fact that—as indicated by the member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan), the former very competent deputy chair of that committee—while she and the Independent member for Moore (Mr Filing) had a minority report in the
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         About time
        </emphasis>
        report, their report, which also referred to sitting hours, did not in any way contest the time when the House would rise on Mondays, Tuesdays and Wednesdays. That time was to be 8 o'clock. That was proposed by the committee initially. It was also endorsed by the member for Moncrieff and the member for Moore in their dissenting report.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The following quote was a unanimous response from members of all parties who participated in the Procedure Committee. In the report which reviewed those proposals, paragraph 9.2.8 on page 33 states, `It is recommended that no change be made to the sitting hours of the House.' A lot of the proposals that the Leader of the House (Mr Reith) has brought forward on behalf of the government are of course proposals which were suggested in
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Time for review
        </emphasis>
        and which I endorse.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I do not endorse the sitting hours. I really believe those sitting hours are nonsensical. If it really is a matter of finding the additional
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         1&amp;half; hours, then members know that our alternative proposal is the sensible way to go about it. Could I say to new members that, after you have been here for a while and are sitting around this place until 11 o'clock at night, I do not know what you will say to your constituents when they ask you how you can give sensible consideration to legislation when you are sitting into the middle of the night. That is what you will be asked, and the Leader of the House knows it.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The point has also been made about the enormous additional cost that is going to be involved. If we look at these proposals, we will sit on the Monday until 11 o'clock at night instead of 8 o'clock and we will achieve an extra 1&amp;half; hours of debating time. But we will not make up any extra time on the second day, on the Tuesday. Although there will be an additional 4&amp;half; hours that we have to remain in this building, we will have only 1&amp;half; extra hours for debating time. That is not sensible. I make that point emphatically.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        If it is not sensible, then you need to examine the real reasons why these changes have been introduced and why we are going to be required to stay in this building until 11 o'clock at night instead of getting out at 8 o'clock. I can only speculate about that, and I am sure you will as time proceeds—as you well should. Medical experts and members of the former parliament have indicated their concerns about those sitting hours and about members and staff being kept around here until 11 o'clock at night. It is nonsensical. They really should not have been introduced and I am disappointed that they have been. We can only speculate about the real reasons why they have been introduced.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I want to emphasise a few other points in the limited time that I am going to take. The member for Moncrieff referred to the sitting hours proposed in her dissenting report and that of the Independent member for Moore to the initial report

         Time for

        . I have emphasised that there were no proposals for a change to the end of the sitting day in their dissenting report. In connection with the grievance debate, the member for Moncrieff referred to the fact, as the Leader of the House has indicated, that there will be a firm
        <break page="112" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         time of one hour 20 minutes placed in the standing orders for the grievance debate to give backbench members—private members of this chamber—the right to make a contribution. While that did not exist under the previous arrangement, I think on every occasion—I can be corrected—the then Leader of the House, the present Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley), moved that the time for the grievance debate be extended to ensure that all of that time was available.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We all accept the political rhetoric that is involved in debates of this kind and everyone, including the newer members, will become increasingly familiar with it and experienced in it. We are going to gain 1&amp;half; extra hours in debating time by adding 4&amp;half; hours to the time that we are required to be here, including finishing at 11 o'clock. We have suggested an alternative, and it really should be considered, where if the purpose of these changes is to get those 1&amp;half; extra hours you can do so by adding an extra half an hour on to the three days. Instead of getting up at 11 o'clock at night, we would get up at 8.30 p.m. You people were not consulted about this. I hope that in your party rooms you are going to have your say—and I hope you do in future—because it does not make sense.

        If there is concern that during the dinner period when the House would still be sitting your dinner could be interrupted, look at the numbers. If the opposition calls for a division, it is going to be more symbolic than ever. We can give an assurance not to call quorums during that time, and I think we can probably also give an assurance to minimise divisions because we are not going to win any. In fact, I do not think we want to draw the attention of the national community to the fact that our numbers are so depleted. Why would we want to put them on the record?

       I was a little disturbed about one point. When the member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) spoke, I did not mean to be offensive when I interjected. What I meant to say was that we do not need to sit here and listen to a trip down memory lane as to what has occurred since 1976. You are in government now. Let us look to the future. We in the opposition have said that some of the changes you are now making will be supported by us—and so we should support them. I refer to the 2 o'clock start for question time and the change regarding second reading speeches. I found it extraordinary that the member for Moncrieff said that she was never given a copy of a second reading speech by the then minister for health. I would like to question that further because I know that in my previous capacity, on behalf of my minister, we always made sure that the opposition spokesman was provided not only with the second reading speech but also with briefings by the department well before the actual debate took place in the House. So I find that extraordinary. They are matters that must also be corrected for the

       record.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       One of the areas that I find quite extraordinary is something we heard from the member for Wide Bay (Mr Truss)—in fact, almost ad nauseam. The member for Moore (Mr Filing) touched on it as well. I refer to the raising of standards. The Governor&amp;hyphen;General, in speaking on behalf of the government yesterday, also mentioned it in his speech. I say to every member of parliament: you raise the standards from yourself first. Whether we sit later or
       <break page="114" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
        whether we sit for shorter hours, whether we debate longer or whether we start question time at 2 o'clock, 3 o'clock or 9 o'clock, the standards come from the individual, first and foremost. This is something that was perpetually put out by the government when they were in opposition—that the standards of this House have gone down because of minister X, Y or Z or prime minister X, Y or Z. The standards of the House start with the individuals. Examine thy own first and then come forward with what standards, and standards in debate, should be.

       When personal attacks come forward, who makes them? It is not the sitting times of the House that cause a personal attack; it is the person, the individual. I find it appalling that we should be tarnished with one brush. As the old cliche goes, you don't throw out the whole box of apples because one of them has gone rotten. Also, as the member for Wide Bay tried to say repeatedly, even the media may start reporting more fairly the actions and statements of the parliament. The sitting times, such as a 2 o'clock start for question time, will not instruct the media of this country on how they will report or not report. Those are the points we must look at in the future.

       I think it is very foolish that we are going to sit on Mondays and Tuesdays at those particular times when we realise how many years it has taken us to introduce more sensible times for debate.

        Hansard

These are points that must be considered.

        I agree with a point that has already been picked up by previous speakers. It crossed my mind that, previously, the catering staff complained that we did not have an actual break and that we had a choice as to whether or not we stayed to eat in Parliament House. Perhaps on Monday and Tuesday nights the government is agreeing to say to the catering staff, `Yes, we will give you a commitment that we will provide a closed shop so that no one can move between the hours of 6.30 and 8 o'clock and they are going to have to participate in what is provided; otherwise they will go without.' After all, no&amp;hyphen;one feels like eating at 12 o'clock at night. So if you do not eat at the desired time, that is an agreement we may hear about in the days ahead.

        I agree with everything we have put forward. I reiterate and confirm, as the Manager of Opposition Business (Mr Crean) has stated, that we should have a little more consultation and a little more commonsense.

That is why I support the amendment that is before the House and will be voting for it.

       The Leader of the House is a former suburban solicitor; he presumably knows the difference between innocent, negligent and fraudulent misrepresentations. He has been disingenuous in the extreme in trying to say that this is a sensible take-up of the Procedure Committee's recommendations. The Procedure Committee has reported, effectively, twice in the last three years and has said that for health, efficiency and cost reasons there should be an 8 o'clock close rather than an 11 o'clock close. That is the first point I briefly make.

       The second point I make is on my own behalf and also on behalf of members from Western Australia. When change was made in late 1993 to take effect from early 1994, the price paid in terms of time—to bring the hours of closing down from 11 o'clock at night to 8 o'clock at night, which I supported—was that the House moved from a sitting pattern of Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday and Thursday to Monday of each week; we moved from seven days to eight days.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       The price that Western Australian members paid for that was, effectively, 10 extra Sundays per year away from electorate and family. That price will remain to be paid, on the proposals moved by the Leader of the House, without any consequent advantages either to Western Australian members or to the House itself. The effect of the motion moved by the Leader of the House has been
       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        to increase our sittings by 1&amp;half; hours—1&amp;half; hours which can, of course, be competently and easily made up without an 11 o'clock close by the amendment moved by the Manager of Opposition Business.

      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       The problem that is caused for Western Australian members is that if we want to arrive in Canberra to sit on a Monday we have to travel on a Sunday. Under previous administrative arrangements, Western Australian members would leave Perth at 5.00 or 5.30 on a Sunday afternoon to travel to Melbourne and be taken by way of government VIP flights from Melbourne to arrive in Canberra at midnight or 1.00 a.m. That made sure that we had some capacity to discharge our local community and family obligations.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       As a result of changes made by the current government, that arrangement is now off. If you want to travel from Western Australia to Canberra to sit on Monday, you need to catch a plane from Perth no later than 1 o'clock on Sunday afternoon.

But you deprive Western Australian members of that for what? What you get is 1&amp;half; hours extra sitting, and the price all members pay for that is the price to which attention was drawn by the Procedure Committee in two separate reports—health, efficiency and cost. For those reasons, briefly, I support the amendment moved by the member for Hotham, the Manager of Opposition Business.

Our complaint is that the previous government did not treat the parliament in the way that it should have done. There has been much talk about consultation from the other side in the contribution to this debate.

        In respect of the changes that we have brought forward for today, we made a public statement of those at the end of March which gave him ample opportunity to put any alternative proposition. We have had no such proposition from him, no conversation with him, no initiative from him whatsoever until today—and he is the one talking about notice! It would make you choke to hear these people talk about consultation and wanting to develop and accept the basic spirit of the propositions which the government is putting. Therefore, I am going to be very brief.

        There has been a lot of conversation about sitting hours. The member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) made a very wise reflection on this: it has been a matter of ongoing debate for many years and there is sure to be continuing debate in the years ahead. That is a very sensible comment, and she put it in proper perspective because the other elements of this package are very significant. It is interesting
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">

        We are very conscious of occupational health and safety issues, but one has to remember that a few years ago we used to sit four nights a week. Furthermore, with the very poor management we had from those on the other side, at the end of a session we would have sittings until 1 o'clock, 2 o'clock and 3 o'clock in the morning. That was how those opposite used to run this place. However, there were some changes.

        In comparison with what used to be the case, we are now proposing that we sit for two nights until 11 o'clock instead of the four nights that we once had to suffer. Of course, we are also providing further opportunities for party room meetings. These meetings are very important because they give backbenchers a chance to question the executive and the ministers on both sides of the fence. That is a sensible change which has been included in this program.

         —Order! Those members disappearing out the back door should not do so. Taking advantage of a captive audience, I would like to make a few observations chiefly for the benefit of the very large number of new members but also, unfortunately, for the benefit of some of our longer standing members. Firstly, when the occupant of this chair stands it is obligatory on all members to resume their seats immediately and not to leave the chamber.

        Secondly, yesterday one member brought in a mobile phone. That is out of order. No mobile phones will be brought into this chamber. Members might have noted that the member for Sydney was present for the division without wearing a jacket. That is admissible for divisions and quorums. The standing orders provide that any member doing so must leave immediately after the quorum or the division. I had occasion yesterday to caution two members about standing order 57, and I draw that to the attention of all members of this House.

         I would now like to make some mention of standing order 56. I will not go on at great length. I am sure we all agree that this chamber is the epitome of the representation of democracy and the freedom of the parliament and the people of Australia. That is expressed in the chair. We therefore believe that stand ing order 56 must be observed with proper respect for the chair and the standing orders of this chamber.

        The final point I would like to make is that we do have a number of maiden or first speeches coming up later in the day. Over recent years there has arisen an aberration where members and members of the public in the galleries have resorted to applause. I would like to inform all members that applause is out of order, particularly in the galleries. If you wish to express your approval, perhaps the traditional, `Hear, hear!' would be acceptable.

       This is again another one of the changes we are proposing to overcome restrictions imposed by the previous government at the behest of the then Prime Minister, Mr Keating, and the then Leader of the House, now Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley). This measure restricted certain aspects of broadcasting, in particular the rebroadcasting of points of order. The proposed motion will require that broadcasts shall be used only for the purposes of fair and accurate reports and, furthermore, that reports of proceedings shall be such as to provide a balanced presentation of differing views.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       This by and large reflects the practice in the Senate. It has worked quite satisfactorily. It was only the previous government's fixation for these matters and its enthusiasm for restricting broadcasting that this proposal was ever introduced in the first place. We are therefore overturning that and introducing what we think is a far more balanced and reasonable proposition.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       With respect to penalties, the only variation we have from the Senate conditions is the specific provision for the imposition of penalties for breaches. That is basically in the hands of the committee. To that extent, the provisions on penalties are effectively guidelines.

       This is essentially a machinery matter. At the start of a new parliament it is not practical for consideration of committee, delegation reports and private members' business to take place on the first sitting Monday. This motion simply allows the two hours 15 minutes allotted for committee, delegation reports and private members' business next Monday to be used for government business.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       The grievance debate will also be moved forward to take place immediately after the presentation of petitions in order to avoid having to interrupt government business after question time. It just makes for easier flow. The intention at the present time is to devote as much time as possible to the address-in-reply debate during government business time on that day. This will enable private members to participate and new members to make maiden speeches. The government will be moving quickly to propose the appointment of a selection committee so that the opportunity to debate committee and delegation reports and private members' business can occur as soon as possible. I commend the motion to the House.

Through you, Mr Deputy Speaker Nehl, I would like to give notice to the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp), a former member for Gilmore and one whose constituents still remember and respect him for his understanding of the electorate and its people, that Gilmore urgently needs to have its road links in place, particularly the Princes Highway and trunk road 92. The people of Gilmore, especially the 7,600 small businesses, are delighted that this government has, once again, opened the door to regional development and infrastructure. For us the benefits and social wellbeing could very well be offset against capital costs. These same businesses are ready to employ extra staff, depending on the outcome of our industrial relations reforms.

         The newly formed electorate of Longman was named after the first woman ever to stand for and be elected to the Queensland state parliament. In fact, she was only the third woman ever to be elected to any Australian parliament. Irene Maud Longman represented the electorate of Bulimba from 1929 to 1932. As a conservative politician she represented the Progressive National Party. She was a long&amp;hyphen;time member of the Queensland Women's Electoral League and the only woman of that organisation ever to be elected to parliament. I believe Irene Longman would be well pleased to see so many women from the non&amp;hyphen;Labor side of politics elected to this place on their ability and their determination and without the demeaning and artificial quotas promoted by Labor.

Longman extends in a band to the north and the west of Brisbane and covers an area of approximately 4,800 square kilometres.

         Longman could almost be described as two electorates in one, as the east and the west of the electorate are divided by the Daguilar Range. This poses its own very special problems as there is no connecting road between the east and the west of the electorate. Most of the 30,000 residents living in the west of the electorate have to travel for two hours through seven other electorates simply to visit my office. In simple terms, almost one&amp;hyphen;third of all my constituents must drive past seven other federal members' offices en route to visit their own federal member.

         My election to this place is the culmination of 13 months of hard work by a dedicated team of people that I call the Longman Liberal team. As it is a new electorate with extremely limited resources and only a very small party structure, I realised that I had to build a team of loyal and dedicated supporters if I was to reach my objective of being the first member for Longman in the first Howard government. Any individual who wishes to be considered a leader must set standards and the example that they wish their supporters to follow. It was my belief at that time that the coming federal election was going to be a very tough fight indeed, and that the future of Australia, an Australia that I believe in passionately, was at stake. So it was an easy decision for me to dissolve my business partnership and to campaign full time.

         Over the past year I have continually listened to the electorate and developed a detailed knowledge of the many difficulties facing the people of Longman. Whilst many are common to all districts, some are more pronounced in particular localities. Bribie Island, for example, has a high concentration of retired families, people who came to live in this part of the world because of its natural beauty and its quiet lifestyle. A consequence of this migration of senior citizens has been the increased demand for retirement villages, aged persons hostels and nursing homes. As demand increases, waiting lists continue to grow, creating stress on frail and often vulnerable people.

         Many of this region's senior citizens are from the veterans' community, men and women who have sacrificed much to ensure that we enjoy our freedom today. With the end of World War II now more than 50 years behind us, many people could be forgiven for thinking that the number of veterans and their spouses requiring assistance will soon be on the wane. This could not be further from the truth, as the Legacy organisation, which is dedicated to the care of war widows and their children, anticipates that demand will not peak for that organisation until the year 2005.

It includes small crop farmers, manufacturers, the retail sector and service providers. They know that business can, and should be, a whole lot better. The one trait that most of them have in common is their frustration with the previous Labor government's policies which restricted their growth and established bureaucratic barriers, particularly in the form of the unfair dismissal legislation.

         It would be remiss of me not to remind the House of the serious plight of Australia's farming community and particularly those farmers in the Brisbane Valley. This region of Queensland which produces dairy products, beef and a large range of fruits and vegetables is still drought declared. Unfortunately, it has been in the grip of drought now for more than five years. Whilst the rural communities were thankful for the fodder drives which brought much needed assistance, all the cattlemen of Longman ever saw were the trucks speeding down the Warrego Highway to destinations such as Charleville, Miles and Chinchilla. Some of these farms are located less than 50 kilometres from the Brisbane CBD, yet the drought has had the same devastating impact on them. The underground water supply continues to drop and the creeks have not run since 1992. It is essential that we continue to recognise the impact the drought is having on both farmers and the communities who rely so heavily on the jobs and the income they produce.

He asserted then that he would carry out his party's policies, which have been given an emphatic mandate, with fairness and understanding.

The deficit,

         whatever its size, said the Prime Minister, would be shouldered before a single one of his promises would be broken. He said, `The public good is not measured in dollars and cents; it is measured in trust.' The rhetoric flowed and the people believed.

        Now, if the nations' newspaper reports are correct, Australia stands on the threshold of the most savage cuts to public expenditure ever carried out. During his first year in government our Prime Minister hopes to shave $4 billion off the nation's deficit, followed by another $4 billion in the next year. If the entrails have been read accurately, 15,000 public servants are to be sacked and government programs will either be cut or have their budgets shaved to such an extent that they will become ineffectual.

By the end of its term the coalition may well lead a country with its bankbook in the black but it will have shown Australian people that its heart is cloaked in the same absence of colour. While we may face the new millennium, to use the words of the Deputy Prime Minister (Mr Tim Fischer), as a `leaner' and `meaner' nation, I fear we will find ourselves living in a society which as a result is a much meaner place.

         Of all of his election promises, the one which the member for Bennelong and his coalition stood by with the most firmness and determination was the one that none of his pledges would be broken. How often we heard it! It was a tired old political cliche perhaps, but it was one which the now Prime Minister sought to impress upon the electorate, using his reputation as a supposedly honest and decent politician.

         He went one step further to convince Australians of his earnestness. He went on and said that, if in government after election day, rather than break any of his promises he and the coalition would tolerate a budget deficit of whatever size. Now, if what we hear about the government's plans for a wholesale slaughtering of public servants' jobs for the sake of the deficit is true, that would mean a major betrayal of that central election promise, and a betrayal also of his colleagues' promises.

         Taking up the Prime Minister's line of putting people before the public purse, the member for Ryan, then shadow minister for public administration, now Minister for Industry, Science and Tourism (Mr Moore), put out a press release on 26 February in which he said, `There will be no mass sackings of public servants under the coalition.' The member for Ryan could have said, `There will be no mass sackings unless there is a budget deficit—and then we will cut left, right and centre.' But he did not. His continuing line leading up to the election was that such criticism was part of a Labor smear campaign.

          The now Deputy Prime Minister, Mr Fischer, has agreed with his coalition partners, although at first glance he would seem to have completely contradicted them both. Five days before the member for Ryan's press release, the now Deputy Prime Minister was quoted in the

          </emphasis>
          as saying that Australia needed lean and mean government and `if that means 20,000 fewer public servants, so be it'. When questioned about his statement, the now Deputy Prime Minister of this country denied that he had ever used such a figure and said that any reduction in the number of public servants would be through natural attrition. The Deputy Prime Minister was given the chance to come clean on coalition plans for the mass sackings of public servants but he chose to deny any intentions of the kind.

          Two coalition members, one of them now the Deputy Prime Minister of Australia and the other a former coalition member of parliament, stated quite publicly that there would be no mass sackings of public servants.

          <para first-indent="16">
           There would be a betrayal of trust in other ways.

           Let us look more closely. In that same press release—and I am sure I am able to mention it because it is on the public record of 26 February—the member for Ryan on behalf of his leader in the coalition stated that a coalition government would `act to improve public administration as a means of bringing about an improvement in our system of government'.

           Rather than delivering a more efficient and improved public administration, the mass sackings of public servants would lead to irreparable damage in a sector which is essential for the continued success of our parliamentary democracy. The member for Ryan recognised the link between sound government and a sound Public Service in that same press release. He should now also be able to recognise that when public administration suffers so does good government.

          <para first-indent="16">
           While savings of a sort are possible in the public sector, the idea that the government is able to get the kinds of savings it wants by cutting indiscriminate chunks away from an already very lean Public Service is ludicrous. Let us look at it this way: if you were to sack every public servant in Canberra you would make savings of only $1.5 billion.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           The message is clear: cutting public servants on the scale envisaged by the Prime Minister will not deliver the savings he feels are necessary. So where can he and his government hope to cut the remaining $6.5 billion? I shudder to think. To slash the Public Service to the extent that the government is said to be planning would be to compromise all the things that the member for
           <break page="131" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
            Ryan promised the coalition stood for. He spoke then of a service which could give `professional advice', of a more `efficient and professional sector'. He said that the coalition recognised the needs of `the public and of the service'. Quite obviously, any such professionalism would be jeopardised by the mass sackings.
           </break>
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           The truth is that the Australian Public Service has been reduced by 18 per cent over the last seven to eight years as a result of efficiency demands placed on that sector by the previous Labor government. There is simply nothing more left there to cut. If much more goes, we will all suffer with it. If the government chooses to target the Public Service in this fashion it will be sending a powerful message to the rest of Australia—that the sector is full of deadwood. It would be perpetuating the reprehensible notion that public servants spend their days making cups of tea and eating Iced VoVos, and because of that they can be got rid of quickly. Regarding the Public Service in such a fashion is an insult to the legacy of such great Australians as Nugget Coombs and Sir Robert Garran. If the government continues in this vein it can consider itself a contributor to the destruction of the service's reputation and, more importantly, its morale.

           What are the government's commitments to rural Australia? During the election campaign, the coalition promised Australians living in rural areas that their government would ensure people have fair and equitable access to housing, health, education, communications, new technology and government services. Do they seriously think that carving $8 billion worth of savings from the public purse will help deliver such benefits to rural Australia, benefits they have promised to pass on and protect? Of course they do not, because cuts on that scale would devastate rural Australia. That is something which I am sure my honourable friends in the National Party recognise and are certainly getting increasingly nervous about.

           I would like to go further on this point. During the election campaign, our Prime Minister often spoke of the coalition's distress at the number of Australia's unemployed. He and the members of the coalition called it a national disgrace. When the then Leader of the Opposition's shadow minister for employment, Dr David Kemp, launched the coalition's employment policy he said, `We are promising to create many jobs, many more real jobs, than Labor.'
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           Having expressed their indignation at unemployment levels and their commitment to reducing such levels when their turn came around, could the same people and the same party now make significant contributions to them and then say that they have kept their promise to reduce unemployment? I would think not. Would adding some 15,000 public servants to the queue in the Department of Social Security correspond with the promise by Dr Kemp and our Prime Minister to reach full employment in Australia? It certainly does not look like it to me. It is, in fact, horrendously inconsistent with such statements.

          <para first-indent="16">
           And what of the pledges by the Prime Minister on the environment? Since he launched the coalition's environment policy early in the election campaign, he has endeavoured to portray himself as a convert to the environmental cause. Apart from links with the sale of Telstra, his environmental policy and his personal statements were met warmly by our nation's environmental groups. He, in turn, convinced a number of Australians of his `pure' environmental intentions.

            Real action indeed! During the coalition's first seven weeks in office, Australians have learnt that this Prime Minister is giving serious consideration to scrapping the Commonwealth Environment Protection Agency. Some say that his serious consideration has actually developed into a firm intention. In fact, it has been reported that the EPA staff have now been given verbal notification that their agency would be abolished, saving $20 million and shutting down 150 workers, the majority of whom are based in Canberra. The savings to the government are clear—but what of the cost to Australia as a whole?

           <para first-indent="16">
            The Environment Protection Agency, established by the Labor government in August 1991, oversees 15 federal acts and was pivotal in the previous government's move to develop national environmental standards related to water quality, air quality, fuel standards, control of hazardous waste and pollution. The EPA polices a number of environmental standards that Australia is committed to via international agreement, such as those for ozone protection, wetlands preservation, greenhouse emissions and the transportation of hazardous waste—a role that the state agencies certainly cannot mirror. Let us not forget that the EPA is responsible for the carrying out of environmental impact statements for the Commonwealth. It is the EPA that would conduct an environmental study on the impact of opening Jabiluka, the uranium mine in the pristine wilderness of Kakadu. Of immediate interest also to my own constituents, the EPA is responsible for conducting a thorough environmental impact statement on the proposed Badgerys Creek airport.

            Not that the government will admit to breaking its word should it choose to cut the agency. You can be sure that the government will talk of the evils of duplicating federal and state services. It will say that the state EPA bureaus will be able to take on more responsibilities in order to match the duties of the current Commonwealth agency. Yet we all know that each state and each state government has an agenda of its own. For instance, we all know that the Northern Territory government has long been a supporter of opening up Kakadu to further mining development. It, like any other state or territory government, will act in its own revenue raising interests and not those of other Australians who desire world renowned wilderness areas such as Kakadu to remain as untouched and unspoilt as they presently are.

            The covenant of trust will be broken in further ways. I refer, of course, to the coalition's commitment to justice. In February, when the then shadow Attorney&amp;hyphen;General, Senator Vanstone, released the justice policy for the coalition, it was trumpeted as the most comprehensive law and justice policy ever released by an opposition. Yet one of the main organs of justice of the Commonwealth government, the office of the Commonwealth Ombudsman, has been slated by the Howard coalition for cuts of something like $1.5 million—a 30 per cent cut to its present operations.

            How does such a move meet the coalition's pre&amp;hyphen;election promise to `redress the inability of Australians' to access justice? It does not. Such a move would be in complete conflict with such an objective. The Commonwealth Ombudsman investigates complaints concerning the bureaucracies associated with the federal government.

He ran as an Independent and, through the influence of some friends, I found myself as one of his campaign supporters. I later realised the wisdom of the Liberal Party's preselectors when I took him on a pub crawl through Camden. He borrowed money from me before each of the four hotels.

I have had the honour of serving as a member of Australia's oldest parliament, in New South Wales, since 1984, including seven years in cabinet and three years as the Premier of my state. My maiden speech in that parliament as the newly elected member for Camden was made on a cold August night to a near empty chamber in Macquarie Street. I was, at that time, a member of the opposition. I subsequently won the seat of Southern Highlands in 1988 and my new federal seat of Macarthur incorporates about 90 per cent of those areas I represented as a state member. I can claim, therefore, a continuous parliamentary representation of the same district, and many of the same constituents, since 1984.

          The electorate of Macarthur contains a number of areas that, in many ways, are a microcosm of Australia itself. There are those who are first home buyers; there are those who are seeking to establish for themselves and their families—in many cases, their young families—a way of life that is better for all of them. It is interesting to note that, in the success we achieved at the last election, so many of those that changed their votes to vote Liberal in the seat of Macarthur came from the areas that might otherwise have been recognised as Labor heartland. And they came to the Liberal Party in the manner in which they voted because they had been deserted by Labor. They were offered no hope; they were offered no understanding of what it meant to get ahead in terms of the progress they wanted for themselves and their families.

        It is always interesting to note transformations. We heard yesterday of the quite remarkable transformation of the new Speaker. One day he was the Chief Opposition Whip, the next day a so&amp;hyphen;called independent Speaker; one day winning 41 hard&amp;hyphen;earned ballots in the Liberal party room, knocking Ironbar and the member for New England (Mr Sinclair) out of the race—a real knock `em down, lay `em flat sort of party battle—the next day an independent Speaker of the House of Representatives. These ironies extend to the member for Macarthur, the new Minister for Finance: one day guarding the state finances in New South Wales, guarding state grants against Commonwealth attacks, making public statements about how none of these state grants should be touched; the next day arriving in this place as the head man on the razor gang, to cut away those state grants and programs in education, health and housing.

He is no more independent than I am, just as the new member for Macarthur is no more able to legitimately cut away at the finances of the Commonwealth. Given his very strong public record as Premier of New South Wales, he cannot say that none of those outlays, none of those grants, to the states in education, health and housing can possibly be touched without massive social dislocation and inequity in our society.

        After 13 years many Australians have been keen to judge the character of this new government. We can tell a lot about a new government from its early decisions, its priorities, its concerns, its political strategy. What have Australians found in this new Howard-Fischer government? What sorts of conclusions are they now drawing? I think they are finding a mean streak, a nasty streak. They are finding a determination to set Australian against Australian by fanning bigotry, fanning prejudice, in our society.

This new government could have announced, for instance, in its first bundle of decisions major changes to Australia's health structures, the rejuvenation of Australia's education system, ambitious plans following Brian Howe's outstanding work for a revolution in the way in which we provide public housing in this country, and policies that go to the heart of better government, better structures and better performance by the public sector.

        The other thing we will hear in these first speeches, and it is an ideology across the government benches, is this concept of the crowding out thesis—that somehow the public sector is crowding out small business in Australia and that somehow the welfare state is crowding out civil institutions. I see one of the new members at the back nodding. He should understand that half of the small businesses in Australia are sole traders. Of the 800,000 small businesses in Australia, 400,000 are sole traders. From ABS data, they would have been known 10 years ago as employees—carpenters, tradesmen and computer technologists working for companies but who have now gone out to form their own businesses and are working by themselves for themselves.

       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        There is no crowding out of small business by the public sector, because for most small businesses in Australia their success is a function of spending power.

         The function and success of small business is a function of the demand side—how much people spend. Small businesses rely on ex penditure. In many parts of Australia, including Campbelltown, they rely on public expenditure. If that public expenditure is removed from the local economy, there is no private expenditure to take its place. It is self-evident that this government's strategy of cutting away at the public sector, disadvantaging already depressed regional economies by taking away those public resources, will add to unemployment. It will make the task of small business so much harder.

        There is an easy way to understand this, and it relates to the Prime Minister's background. In the election campaign he said that he was keen on small business, because that is his family background. He was a bowser boy in inner Sydney. But he does not understand that the success of that business depended on the volume of petrol purchased. The success of that business depended on the demand for petrol and not on the supply&amp;hyphen;side considerations for which he now has a fetish as Prime Minister. So most small businesses in Australia rely much more on spending power in the community than they do on any of the supply&amp;hyphen;side micro reforms this government has on its agenda.

You will find that most monetary policy is converging around some basic fundamentals.

The people of Moreton want this government to get the basic things right first: the family, small business, the creation of real jobs—all items which Labor left off its agenda. Labor said there was simply nothing wrong. Labor said families were well looked after and small business was booming.

        Labor's idea of multiculturalism was based on segmenting the community, not bringing it together. Unlike Labor, I believe Australians of all backgrounds and beliefs can unite by emphasising the similarities, not highlighting the differences. Labor's way needed legislation to force conformity and adherence. Labor's approach caused great resentment among many Australians. I believe the Howard government will build a better future for all Australians and will bring us all closer together.

        As a new member in this place, my prevailing enthusiasm is tempered and sobered by the great responsibility which we all share. The changes we must realise which everyday Australians expect us to deliver are important. Australians want early signposts from the new government that action is taking place. Australians of all backgrounds and ages want to be able to plan for the future and work to meet their goals with certainty. They do not want a repeat of the Labor years where government constantly changed rules and conditions. As honourable members would know, superannuation laws are the classic example.

         forgotten the worker, are the only ones with anything to fear from any changes introduced by the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith).

He was survived by his wife Carol and three young sons: Nicholas, Simon and Christopher. Ron was a journalist who, in my view, was exceptional amongst Western Australian political journalists and who also, from time to time, worked for the Australian Labor Party. Ron was the only WA political journalist I knew who had a timetable, horizon or view that was longer than that day's deadline.

The last time I spoke to Ron was on the night of the election when, with the three&amp;hyphen;hour time difference, we already had the bad general news. I rang Ron at home to tell him that, despite the bad general news, we had managed to sneak over the line in Perth.

         As a result of the election, our parliamentary party was beaten but not broken, bowed but not disgraced. We had plenty of achievements during our term in office which those on this side of the House can be proud of—including those in respect of job creation, living standards, health and education services and the protection of the environment. We have left the essential parameters of the economy in good shape—with consistent growth over a four-year period running at four per cent, low inflation and a sensible wages policy.

          The features of our 13-year term in office include: increasing the labour force by over two million workers; creating more than 700,000 new jobs in our last three&amp;hyphen;year term in office; massively increasing secondary school retention rates from 30 per cent to percentages in the high 60s or low 70s; massively increasing the number of university places; providing a massive injection of capital into TAFE facilities; creating universal access to health care through Medicare; and, in addition to some of those important economic parameters I have referred to, producing a massive increase in the diversity, range and quantity of exports, which have started the process of turning Australia into a modern trading and exporting country. In the end, `time for a change' as well as other factors got the better of us, but those are things that we on this side of the House can be very proud of.

Senator Kernot, the Leader of the Opposition and I travelled to Port Arthur and spoke to a number of the people who had been directly involved in the tragic circumstances of last Sunday. Later all of us attended a very moving and, I hope to the people most affected, helpful memorial service in the Anglican cathedral in Hobart.

He also announced a contribution to the appeal. We completely endorse that as well. He indicated that there may be other things that he wants to raise with the police ministers. If those matters could be in some way or another presented here in the House before he meets with them, that would be a good thing. If it is not possible to do that because he wants to take these matters more discreetly to those ministers, I completely understand that, but this is a matter where he might choose to find himself more broadly supported.

The way in which the members of the Keating government systematically and cynically dismantled their election commitments immediately after they were elected in 1993, as apparently the now defeated former Prime Minister acknowledges, was one of the major reasons that they were so ignominiously defeated on 2 March this year.

The existing system was one of the factors which led to the worst recession for 60 years—a product of the economic incompetence of the previous government, including the current Leader of the Opposition. Over the 13 years of the previous administration, many Australians have seen falling living standards instead of higher living standards—something which we on this side believe Australians should be able to expect from the Australian economy—under the current industrial relations system. In respect of jobs, the current system fails to give people the opportunity to make a contribution to themselves, to their families and to our wider society by enjoying a job. No more is that apparent than it is for young people. It is a national disgrace that we have very high levels of youth unemployment in Australia. In some parts of regional Australia, youth unemployment rates of 30, 40 and 50 per cent are, sadly, far too common.

        This took the position of the Australian government considerably further than the position of the previous government, as the member for Holt is only too well aware. The previous government's position was a somewhat confused, vacillating position. The confusion of the previous government was brought about by one simple fact: there could never be any agreement reached between the then foreign minister and Senator Robert Ray, the then defence minister. The squabble between the two, which I know the member for Holt would well remember—we find out about these things quite quickly after an election—left Australia with a position which was by no means one of leadership.

There are many reasons for this failure, but one of the major reasons for this failure was your total inability to address the literacy needs of young Australians and of those young people coming out of school and into the work force. Far too many young people are leaving school these days after year 10 without the skills that are most essential to jobs.

        On 18 April Senator Vanstone and I met with a reference group of employers and employer organisations. The issue at the top of their agenda was the issue of literacy.

        The Labor government failed over the whole of its 13-year period in office to effectively help young people who are suffering literacy and numeracy deficits. It is not as if the problem was not recognised. Indeed the honourable member for Batman, when he was the President of the ACTU—and normally the previous government jumped to the instructions of the President of the ACTU—said six years ago: more than one million adult Australians were unable to read a simple sentence in English, understand simple telephone dialling instructions, fill out basic application forms or follow instructions for medication or product use.

         That was six years ago, and now nothing further has been done to alleviate this problem. When the states introduced their popula tion testing in primary schools—the years when those literacy skills can best be acquired—did they get any support from the government? No, they did not. There was a deafening silence from the Labor Party. We are going to change that. The states will have the full support of this government in their population testing at primary school level—grades 3 and 5 in particular—to identify and effectively help those young people who presently are slipping through the net and are not picking up those skills.

        We also regard it as essential that after 13 years of neglect there has been no effort to establish proper baseline data on which Australians can assess the current state of literacy and the effectiveness of literacy policies. Despite widespread concern among parents, employers and the community no such study was made during the whole of the 13 years of the Labor government. The last such study was made in 1980 under a coalition government.

It will enable us to target resources effectively. It will enable us to establish national benchmarks so that the Australian people, parents and the community, can assess whether or not government policies to help Australians acquire literacy skills are working.

         —When I addressed the Australian Council of Social Services in October last year as Leader of the Opposition, as well as putting down some broad approaches to the welfare safety net and the approach of the coalition in government to the welfare safety net, I announced that I would have a pilot program to tackle, specifically, one aspect of youth homelessness that caused a great deal of concern to a lot of people in the community. That was whether the youth homeless allowance was too freely and easily available and whether, in the process of the allowance being made available, the legitimate roles of families were not being properly catered for.

        I believed then, and I and the government continue to believe, that there is a very important role to be played by the voluntary welfare organisations in the process of assessing entitlement. I promised that the new

        Pursuant to that commitment, within a couple of weeks of being elected I convened a meeting of the leaders of the major voluntary welfare organisations in Australia, including the Salvation Army, the Brotherhood of St Laurence, the Society of St Vincent de Paul and the Anglican Care in Queensland. That group of people broadly endorsed the government's approach. I am pleased to announce today the terms of reference and the membership of a prime ministerial youth homeless task force that I have established out of that meeting to examine how those pilot programs might be put together. That task force is going to be chaired by Captain David Eldridge, who is the chairman of the Salvation Army's eastern division in Melbourne.

Captain Eldridge has had many years of experience in providing services for young homeless people and their families. The principal, but not the sole, object of this exercise is to see whether through the use of the expertise of the voluntary agencies we can get a better steer as to whether a young person who claims to be entitled to the homeless benefit ought to get that benefit on an ongoing basis.

        The pilots will operate on the basis of a person getting the homeless allowance for a provisional period of six weeks and then the person will be taken, in a sense, into a case management or care situation by an individual agency. That agency will see whether any reconciliation with the family can be established. They will counsel, talk to and assess the young person and, after a period, they will make a recommendation to the department about whether there will be an ongoing benefit granted. The final decision will still be made by the department.

        In a sense, the idea of award simplification is not just shared by those on this side. In fact, when those on the other side were in government, on a number of occasions they said, `Yes, it's a good idea, there are real advantages in doing so.' We give them credit for saying so. The real problem with those on the other side is they were never actually able to implement such a process of award simplification. The previous Prime Minister, Mr Keating, said in April 1993:

        Let me describe the model of industrial relations we are working towards. It is a model which places primary emphasis on bargaining at the workplace level within a framework of minimum standards provided by arbitration tribunals.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        It is a model under which arbitrated awards and arbitrated wage increases would be there only as a safety net. This safety net would not be intended to prescribe the actual conditions of work of most employees but only to catch those unable to make workplace agreements with employers. Over time, the safety net would inevitably become simpler. We would have fewer awards with fewer clauses.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is the one thing on which I agreed with the previous Prime Minister. The sad truth is that, after 13 years of Labor, they were never able to implement that policy. In fact, it was people like the member for Batman when he was President of the ACTU who vetoed sensible reform that could give people the chance of a job and higher wages in the future.

       <para first-indent="16">
        There is a new government. We are intent on giving people a chance of a job. We are intent on giving people a chance to enjoy higher pay. We will be introducing in our package a means by which that can happen. It will be done under the supervision of the commission. It will be done on the basis that people are guaranteed their wages. It will be done fairly. It will be done in a reasonable way. I believe it is one of the many things that can be achieved that will give people a much fairer go in the industrial relations system in the future.

One is in the motor vehicle industry area and it has 202 pages. I have got another one here which has 260 pages—that is for the meat industry. The meat industry is one area where, if we could get some sensible reforms, we can protect people's pay and in fact give them a chance of more pay in the future. We can create more jobs and boost our export income, which will start to fix Australia's massive and chronic debt with which you people left us. So is it a good idea? It is a great idea. It is just a pity that you people never had what it takes to give us the leadership to make these ideas happen.

        There are two reasons why we have a big current account deficit and a large foreign debt. The first reason is that we are badly in need of micro-economic reform. Until that is tackled, you will not start to reduce the current account deficit. The second reason, as you well know and even I think the shadow Treasurer knows—and anybody with any economic literacy on the front bench of the opposition knows—is that we have an appallingly low level of national savings.

        Now those two things have to be tackled. You know as well as do I that, unless we tackle the budget deficit, unless measures are taken to reduce the size of the budget deficit, unless we have an honest approach to the budget deficit through a charter of honesty, we are never going to boost our national savings. So every time you deny that there is a budget deficit problem, every time you deny that even if there is a problem it does not matter—every time you engage in that double denial, you are demonstrating a complete indifference to fundamental economic problems that you yourself asserted existed when you were in government.

I think, as you would recall, nearly eight years ago one of your predecessors reluctantly, after some pressure from members of the opposition, agreed to place two Australian flags here on what appears to be a rather temporary basis. My question to you is: are you going to do anything to give the flag a position of more prominence and more permanence in this chamber?

It was then his policy that when two or more members rose on the eligible side—and I exclude the Leader of the Opposition in that regard because he has a special privilege—to grant the call to the member who was recorded as having asked the least number of questions. I ask that you consider the reinstatement of this policy, particularly the maintenance of a list where members can be aware of their opportunities to ask another question.

        —Mr Speaker, during the recent election campaign a direct mail letter was circulated throughout the electoral division of Curtin under the signature of the now Treasurer, the member for Higgins (Mr Costello). In exhorting the electors to vote for the endorsed Liberal candidate—not surprisingly—the Treasurer quoted, by way of justification, from an article published in the
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
         Australian Financial Review
        </emphasis>
        dated 11 April 1995. The article was written by Mr Peter Walsh, a former Labor senator and minister.
       </para>
      </talk.start>
      <para first-indent="16">
       In seeking to convince the voters to not vote Independent in Curtin, the member for Higgins cited a brief excerpt from Mr Walsh's article. The article included the words: `It'—meaning a vote for me according to Mr Walsh—`could easily be the difference between winning and losing.' The article from which only one sentence was lifted—and indeed the entire article—made no reference to Independent candidates. In discussing the Liberal Party's prospects in Western Australia Mr Walsh wrote in the relevant paragraph—and this is the general tenor of the whole article:
      </para>
      <para font-size="-=2">
       With a bit of luck and good management, they could win 10 out of 14, or 11 if Brand also falls. On the other hand, the Crichton&amp;hyphen;Browne factor and associated intra&amp;hyphen;party brawling could take the Liberal seats down to five or six.
      </para>
      <para>
       This is the sentence that the Liberal member for Higgins chose to use:
      </para>

       It could easily be the difference between winning and losing.

      <para>
       So you can see, Mr Speaker, that the reason for Mr Walsh concluding that the difference between the Liberals not winning up to 11 seats and instead being successful in only five or six was, in Mr Walsh's view, `the Crichton&amp;hyphen;Browne factor and associated intra&amp;hyphen;party brawling' in the Liberal Party. It had absolutely nothing whatsoever to do with me as an Independent candidate.
      </para>
      <para first-indent="16">
       The misrepresentation is borne out by the date when the article was published—11 April 1995. At that time I was a member of the Liberal Party, a condition I had to endure, I must say, for a further four months. For Mr Costello to claim that a vote for me could somehow be the difference between the coalition winning and losing, and justifying that with a published view of Mr Walsh, is unerringly false.

       The second misrepresentation occurred on another occasion. In an advertisement published in the

       Mr Speaker, you will be aware—or you will soon become aware—that a vote to support a ruling made by the Speaker is not a vote against anyone: it is a vote for the ruling of the chair.

       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The ministerial statement relates to a new format for bills and acts. The format currently in use for bills introduced into this parliament has evolved gradually since 1901. It has been only in the last 10 years or so, however, that attention has been paid to the effect on readers of the format in which legislation is set out. This has happened in the context of a growing community expectation that legislation that affects people ought to be accessible to those people.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The accessibility of legislation has several aspects. First, of course, the text of the legislation needs to be comprehensible to its intended audience. As well, legislation needs to be physically accessible to its intended audience—that is, people need access to up&amp;hyphen;to&amp;hyphen;date versions of current legislation, whether in the form of reprints of acts or electronic databases containing consolidated legislation.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        For those who still use printed copies of legislation—which, of course, includes members of this parliament—the page design and
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         layout of legislation also affect its accessibility. Document design is now recognised as a matter which can have a significant impact on the comprehensibility of documents and on how effectively documents communicate information. With this in mind, the Office of Parliamentary Counsel has undertaken a project to improve the design and layout of bills, which of course will also impact on the design and layout of acts.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The result of this project is a new format, which has been adopted by the office for future bills. The main features of the new format are these: there is a substantial increase in the amount of `white space' on each page. This makes the pages look less forbidding, and this in turn contributes to the reader's confidence in dealing with the text. Running headers are used on the top outside corner of each page. The inclusion of section numbers in the running headers will make searching for particular provisions easier. The inclusion of chapter, part and division headings in the running headers will make it easier for readers to interpret individual provisions in context.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Section and subsection numbers are separated out from the text, to make searching for particular provisions easier. Vertical spacing, variable font sizes and different margins give visual clues to the hierarchical relationships between different elements of the text. The text of bills will no longer be right&amp;hyphen;justified. The use of a `ragged' right&amp;hyphen;hand margin makes text easier to read because it means that the spacing between words is the same in each line, rather than varied to ensure a straight right&amp;hyphen;hand margin. All bills will contain a table of contents. Among other things, the table will show all acts amended or repealed by the bill. The first page of a bill will now be a cover page including the long title. The table of contents will start on the inside cover page.

        Several bills were introduced in the last parliament in experimental formats. Now that the new format is settled, it will be used for almost all bills introduced from now on. The new format will also be adopted for reprints of existing acts. There will be a longer transitional period for reprints, because it will take

       <para first-indent="16">
        It is clear from everything that the Reserve Bank has been saying in recent weeks that we are not going to see an interest rate reduction right now. Why not? Because there is significant uncertainty about the future movement of wages growth in present circumstances and whether that will be consistent with the achievement of the underlying target rate, about which everyone agrees, of inflation of two to three per cent.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Why is there, in turn, that uncertainty? Because the coalition has torn up the accord, because it has abandoned wages policy as a crucial instrument of economic policy management in this country and because it has created a climate of conflict and confrontation with the trade union movement—a movement which, if the accord had been maintained, would have been absolutely committed allies in the economic management of this country.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It is not just the Australian Labor Party that is saying all this. Virtually every significant economic commentator in recent days and weeks has nominated uncertainty over wages growth as the key influence on future monetary policy. Syntec—which I said during question time is not a Labor front organisation; we all know that—has been the most explicit of all commentators in this respect, saying in the
        <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">

        of 25 April, just last week:

        The opposition is right in saying now that under a Labor Government falls in official interest rates would be occurring.
       </para>
       <para>
        This is not just out of a clear blue sky so far as Syntec is concerned. It made the point weeks earlier in a corporate brief to its clients on 1 April. It stated:

        Again, talking about the government, Syntec said on 12 April:

       <para font-size="-=2">

        A Labor Government with any sort of post-election Accord would have been legitimately looking for a cut in interest rates.
       </para>
       <para>
        That is the judgment of the financial community as articulated by an organisation which has traditionally been no friend of ours. It is simply making an objective judgment as it sees it about the condition of the economy and the condition of the policy environment now prevailing.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        By 25 April, this judgment had been very much reinforced for the entire financial community by two sets of figures which confirmed that we were absolutely on track as a country in meeting our growth and unemployment reduction objectives. Inflation, you will recall from the figures last week, was confirmed at decreasing, so far as the normal headline rate is concerned, from 5.1 per cent to 3.7 per cent for the 12 months to March—with the underlying rate, which most policy makers regard as a bit more crucial, running at just 3.3 per cent but universally expected to fall below three per cent later this year.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The second set of figures to come out last week related to wages growth. That was confirmed as having come back to a remarkably low 4.2 per cent—absolutely consistent with the accord target, and with every reason to expect that, had the accord remained in place, that target would continue to be met. All this emerged and these figures came out in the context of an economy with an overall growth rate currently running at three per cent—the highest amongst the major OECD economies, and that is something to be very pleased about—even at the bottom of our business cycle.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Putting all that together, conditions were exactly right for an interest rate reduction. There was no need to fear overheating of the economy—inflation was down, wages growth was subdued and the accord was in place as
        <break page="171" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         at 2 March to keep things that way. At the same time, the economy was running at one per cent less growth than it needed to be running—that is, around four per cent rather than its present three per cent—to get the assault on unemployment back on the road. We all know that if we are really going to make a big impact or a significant net impact on unemployment we have to get the growth rate up from three per cent, where it is now, to where it has been for the last three years, which is four per cent.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The only reason that reduction has not already happened is, as I intimated previously, that the Reserve Bank of Australia is nervous, and understandably very nervous, about what the future wage growth will be and whether, in the absence of the accord and in the whole moderate social wage compensation strategy that is associated with the accord, it can be down around 4&amp;half; per cent, which is where it needs to be held if we are going to maintain inflation at that underlying rate of between two and three per cent. The Reserve Bank is concerned that in the new political environment, after 2 March, where the accord has been torn up and where wages policy has been abandoned as an instrument of economic management, wages growth will not now be able to be sustained at the level which has been achieved under the accord and which has clearly been demonstrably achieved over the last six months.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        There is no point in saying, as the Treasurer (Mr Costello) will undoubtedly bellow in his reply, that the budgetary circumstances have changed all this. It is no good talking about inflation, wages growth and growth of the economy as a whole as at 2 March and then saying, `We now have a big deficit problem to contend with.' It is no good saying that the prospect of a deficit next year—if there is no further revision; we expect there will be in growth numbers to change that figure—has removed any possible case for a cut in rates now.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The point is this: there is simply no natural and automatic trade&amp;hyphen;off between budget cuts and interest rate reductions. In fact, if the government's budget cuts involve, as seems inevitable if these targets are to be met—and
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         certainly we heard nothing from the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) or any of the other ministers today to suggest otherwise—the slashing of social programs in areas like health, education, housing and child care, then interest rates are much more likely to rise than to fall.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Why do I say that? Simply this: in that budgetary environment, in that policy environment, workers will seek higher wages than they would otherwise have been minded to seek in order to compensate for cuts in essential social services. Faster wages growth, not fully backed by productivity improvements—and it is difficult to see that it possibly could be backed by productivity improvements in the context I am describing—means higher inflation and that means not lower interest rates but, of course, higher interest rates.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The only chance of a linkage that I can see between government budgetary policy and lower interest rates is that, if this government succeeds in its slash and burn of some $8 billion worth of savings over the next couple of years, the contractionary impact of all that on the economy will be such that we will desperately need interest rate cuts in order to restore the level of economic activity back to where we are now. That is the only rational connection I can see between the budget cuts enterprise and interest rate cuts. Otherwise all the pressures are running the other way.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        But, putting aside all that speculation, just look at what the financial community is now saying. Even after taking full account of all these budget scenarios that are running around, the overwhelming view of private sector economists at the moment is that you will not see an interest rate cut at all in the Australian economy. In fact, the overwhelming view is that the next move in interest rates, whenever it occurs, six months, nine months out, is going to be up, not down.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        So that is the first economic return this government has delivered to the Australian people since the election. The first economic return, the first economic benefit, we have had from them is the loss of otherwise almost certain interest rate cuts right here and now. You have lost it; you have blown it for the Australian people. You have blown it for
        <break page="172" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         home buyers. You have blown it for small business. You have blown it for the unemployed who are hanging on this because of your manic, ideological preoccupation with tearing up accords and abandoning wages policy.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Let me turn, finally, to this larger issue of economic policy that is involved in all of this. By abandoning wages policy as an instrument of macro&amp;hyphen;economic policy management over all policy management in this country, John Howard, the Prime Minister, is taking us straight back to the two-instrument economic policy of the past—that past, which the Prime Minister well remembers when he was Treasurer, when the whole emphasis was simply on fiscal and monetary policy, and you did not have wages policy as a crucial third leg of the tripod. That two&amp;hyphen;instrument economic policy was what delivered Australia their lamentable average growth record under the Fraser&amp;hyphen;Howard government of 2.1 per cent. That was the average growth that was delivered under that particular economic strategy the last time the Prime Minister was in office under the Fraser&amp;hyphen;Howard government.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        It was the three&amp;hyphen;instrument approach—fiscal, monetary and wage policy, together with structural policy there in support as well and, more recently, a savings policy through superannuation—with wages policy as a key third item that in fact delivered under the Labor government an average 3.7 per cent growth for the whole of our 13 years in office—a 3.7 per cent average versus a 2.1 per cent average. The crucial difference in the approach, apart from all the micro&amp;hyphen;economic reform we introduced, was our total reliance on wages policy as a crucial third leg in the economic policy strategy.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Of course, there are some other strands to Labor's economic legacy that will continue under this government, that will not be torn up: micro&amp;hyphen;economic reform and the new emphasis throughout the economy on productivity improvement will, hopefully, continue, and that will be helpful in keeping things moving. But will that be sufficient to stop us sliding back to what seems now to be the generally accepted speed limit for developed economies like the United States of around
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         2&amp;half; per cent growth? That is the prevailing, understood constraint that exists in most of the other developed economies, particularly the United States.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Unless you break out of that constraint and bring wages policy into play as a crucial supplementary instrument to add to monetary policy and to add to fiscal policy, you run a number of risks. You run the risk of losing the cooperative as distinct from the heavy&amp;hyphen;handed fiscal and monetary routes to maintaining low inflation. You certainly lose every chance of maintaining the kind of profit share that has been enjoyed by business right throughout the 1980s and continuing up to the present day. With that risk of higher inflation and lower profit sharing and the lower investment that goes with it, you lose the growth that you need to bring us to what remains a very achievable target of just five per cent unemployment by the year 2000. We can meet that target by creating 220,000 new jobs each year. That is a very achievable target of four per cent or thereabouts growth of the kind we averaged during our last three years in office.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        We can get there as a nation. As a country we can do it. But we can only get there through a sensible, intelligent, rational application of all the tools of economic management that are available to us. If you tear up some of those tools for no other reason than a Thatcherite, ideological preoccupation with small government and distaste for the trade union movement, distaste for the accord and a belief in letting the market rip in every available context and not doing that which is necessary to continue an enormously productive partnership of the kind that we have had over the last 13 years, that is the result that you produce—the incapacity to produce these kinds of outcomes.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        So it is a very high risk game that the government is now playing. For ideological reasons, as I have just said, not for rational economic reasons, it is putting at risk the whole future course of decent economic management in this country. It has already certainly denied an interest rate reduction here and now which would have been, as we all know, of enormous value to Australian home

         —I congratulate the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and member for Holt (Mr Gareth Evans) on his maiden speech, as one should do in circumstances like this, but of course the content of it was essentially flawed. The claim that here we are, two months after the 2 March election, and interest rates would have fallen but for the election of the coalition is preposterous. I suppose that, after suffering the humiliating defeat and after being held to account by the Australian people in the way that the Australian Labor Party was, one would have to think up some way of consoling oneself that the Australian people got it wrong and you got it right. Whatever consolation this may give you, it is not grounded in fact. It is a preposterous claim. Only somebody who is a fool or a knave would try to run it. It is easily disposed of, and I will dispose of it by referring to one media report. The Deputy Leader based his claim on the

         It goes on to say that Mr Beazley hedged on a new accord, pointing out the circumstances which led to the original deal no longer existed. That was a very interesting statement from the Leader of the Opposition and one which I congratulated him on making at the time. Plainly, he realised the failures of the accord.

         The accord was clearly and patently a failure and the Leader of the Opposition—I think on 20 March 1996—recognised that and tried to come to terms with it, as indicated in the

The Deputy Leader of the Opposition, of course, unable to break the symbiotic relationship and aware that the Labor Party fronts in this chamber as the political wing of the ACTU, comes into this chamber and runs nonsensical propositions that, if only we had the ACTU directing economic policy, how much happier it would be.

         Let me tell you: the ACTU directed economic policy for 13 years and the results speak for themselves. Thirteen years of the accord gave us the worst current account deficit in the industrialised world—worse than Mexico's. Thirteen years of the accord took net foreign debt from $23 billion to $185 billion. Thirteen years of the accord found that the average compound growth rate in the CPI was 7.2 per cent in Australia whereas it was 3.8 per cent in the G7. Thirteen years of the accord led to an increase in Commonwealth debt now approaching $100 billion. Thirteen years of the accord got Australia an $8 billion deficit after four or five years of economic recovery.

I know it is the opening of the parliament, but I was thinking of making this a bipartisan policy because there are 20 new coalition members on this side of the House who do consider Paul Keating to be a legend—because of the contribution that he made to their election on 2 March.

The reason the Reserve Bank says that it has a target for interest rates of around five per cent is its premise of a two per cent increase in productivity. A two per cent increase in productivity will bring the underlying inflation rate down about three per cent. But you can bring that underlying inflation rate lower if you can boost productivity—and the very cornerstone of our reform program is to boost productivity by having a new system of industrial relations which will allow employers and employees to agree. That will boost productivity. It will be a system of industrial relations in which there will not be third&amp;hyphen;party interference, one which encourages cooperation in the workplace and which, above all, can get the productivity gains which we need in this country.

The Treasurer (Mr Costello) failed to address the issue in this motion, which essentially is: a lack of wages policy in the economic armoury of a government keeps pressure on interest rates and monetary policy because you are limiting your options.

         get away from the fact that a government, if it is serious about addressing the economic equation, has to come to grips with having a wages policy. A simple reality in this country is that you cannot have a wages policy unless you have a dialogue with the people who set wages. There are no federal powers to do it.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In the absence of those federal powers and because of the role that the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission plays in setting wages in this country, based on arguments and pressures that the ACTU, unions and others pursue, what is needed for a wages policy is, first, a preparedness to engage them in dialogue and, secondly, a basis on which they can negotiate—not the gun at the head or take it or leave it approach, which the government have always accused them of doing and which they are now presenting them with, but a sensible approach.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In this debate there is no point the Treasurer making a segmental analysis about why we have problems. Any Treasurer worth their salt knows they need a balance between fiscal, monetary and wages policy if they are to achieve the improvement they seek. With no wages policy you get imbalance. It is impossible to get the balance that we were able to generate in our period of office. Lack of a wages policy simply means heavier reliance on monetary policy, which is why interest rates are not coming down, and heavier reliance on fiscal policy, which is why the government has a slash and burn mentality in the lead&amp;hyphen;up to this budget.

        The Treasurer squibbed two issues that were directed to him today by way of questions. Firstly, he was asked whether he would indicate when there would be a fall in interest rates and, secondly, whether his inability to do it was due to a lack of wages policy. What was his answer: `It is not the role of government to speculate on the movement of interest rates.' Yet when he was in opposition he constantly asked us as a government to speculate on interest rates, on when the next drop would be. What a hypocrite!

He was asked to release the costings associated with his prom ises and that of his government in the lead-up to the last election. What did he say? He said that we are not going to get them. In other words, the government will release something before an election but they will not give it to us after the election. They will keep that hidden from us. Even though they have the information, they will not give it to us. Some honesty! Some indication of the primacy of this place over the executive, where you will keep that information hidden amongst the Expenditure Review Committee and maybe amongst some of the other members in cabinet, when you will not let the parliament understand the basis upon which your fiscal challenge is really being directed!

         Mention has been made in this place of what the accord has not achieved. I remind the House that what we were able to achieve under accord mark VII, the one before last, over the last three years—not just the 13 years that the shadow Treasurer has referred to—is average economic growth greater than four per cent each year, the fastest of the OECD; inflation at 2&amp;half; per cent; wages growth in the order of four per cent to five per cent; industrial disputation two-thirds lower than it was when you left office; and the creation of 714,000 jobs.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In relation to those 714,000 jobs, I remind the House of what the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) had to say of the accord commitment to jobs. Three years ago he described the accord mark VII's jobs target of 500,000—it was 500,000 at the time—as `an insult to the intelligence of the Australian people.' What did we deliver? Seven hundred and fourteen thousand jobs. Some insult! The then Leader of the Opposition did not believe we could achieve it.

         But what did accord mark VIII have in prospect? It went a step further. There was a commitment from the trade union movement to this.

         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          wages policy would be delivered under the accord consistent with that objective. You have washed that away. I do not know how anyone can come into this place as a Treasurer and pretend that they have an objective of maintaining this underlying rate of inflation, yet wash away the very mechanism by which they would achieve it.

        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Accord mark VIII went further. It also said that the wage claims that the trade union movement would be making would be consistent with achieving a new target in terms of employment growth of 600,000 jobs over its life—in other words, at least 200,000 jobs per year, thereby taking us to that objective of five per cent unemployment which we had set ourselves.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The simple facts are that you cannot get wages policy in this country unless you get the cooperation of the trade union movement. You will not get the cooperation of the trade union movement for a ceiling on wages unless you are also prepared to guarantee a floor. The floor is made up of a number of dimensions, including underpinning award conditions. That will now be eroded by the changes to the Industrial Relations Act that the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith) will introduce, and it has always been underpinned by the social wage aspects—such as superannuation, Medicare and transfer payments.

        <para first-indent="16">
         If you are delivering distribution benefits to the trade union movement in ways other than money wages, then of course you can have more moderate money wage claims and outcomes. But if you cut away the ability to deliver benefits through that and indeed cut the benefits themselves, as we will see happen in this budget, then the trade union movement in this country will have no option but to pursue its claims through one avenue alone: money wages. There is no safety valve left.

        Jennie put it well; she said, `What the employers have got to understand is that they lost the election and we won it.' The unions won the election; the ACTU won the election. We did not have a wages policy; we had a self-interest policy in the interest of trade unions and their peak council, the ACTU. I have another source. The shadow minister for employment and training, Martin Ferguson, who is at the table, said:

        If we do not finally get around to doing a bit about this thing we call micro-economic reform in this country, we are going to continue to have interest rate problems, which go on to exacerbate our current account deficit and the huge, untenable foreign debt that we have accumulated after 13 years under Labor.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Today in question time the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) said that there are two facets of reducing the current account deficit; there are two things that we must do if we are going to get rid of this systemic problem. One of those is to try to encourage Australians to do more about saving, and that is in a personal sense. We on this side of the House will do something about the problem in a government
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         sense by reducing the Commonwealth's demands on public savings through reduced Commonwealth spending.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The other side of the equation is that we have to do something about industry in this country. We consume far too much from overseas. We do not produce enough of what Australians want to use. I remind the House that in 1992-93 the deficit of trade in manufacturing goods totalled $35 billion. I just recently produced figures for 1994-95 of an all-time national record of a $43 billion net deficit in trade in manufactured goods in this country. That is an outstanding record for a Labor government that was in power for 13 years!
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        This was a government that kept talking the entire time about employment. They talked about the needs of workers and the need for people to have jobs. What do we have? One of the highest unemployment rates in the industrialised world, the highest current account deficit in the industrialised world and this huge pall of national debt hanging over our heads every day.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The interest rate problem is significant because we pay high interest rates. We pay higher interest rates than we ought to because of our debt position, and that simply feeds upon itself. So we borrow money to pay interest on the debt that we have already accumulated. Somebody has to do something about that. Development of a wages policy of the kind adopted by the Labor government, which is beholden to the ACTU and the other unions, is not one that this side of the House will ever contemplate because it did not work.

       <para first-indent="16">
        The standard of living of Australians fell during those 13 years. You kept a clamp on wages so that the living standards of Australians could not rise. You did that because they could not contribute to productivity improvements and because the agenda was set by the ACTU. The agenda was set by the unions, not by the employees and employers working together to try to do things in a more modern way. Look at the nonsense we saw at Robe River. If five flavours of ice-cream were not provided at the canteen, everybody went home for the day. That kind of nonsense was written into comprehensive awards, as was
        <break page="179" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         demonstrated by the Minister for Industrial Relations (Mr Reith) during question time today.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Some of these awards encompass such archaic and antiquated provisions that they defy imagination. What we are talking about is simplifying those awards so that they become a core set of conditions that apply to a particular employment area. That is important because they will act as a safety net and they will make sure that people have, at base, a very reasonable standard of living. Beyond that, it is important that employers and employees work together to demonstrate and to prove up employment practices that actually lead to real productivity improvement. Then the gains can be shared amongst business, companies, industry and employees.

       <para first-indent="16">
        It is nonsense that our living standards have to fall in order to have what the Labor Party and the ACTU call a wages policy—a nonsense which must disappear from our vocabulary. I take the point that the Treasurer (Mr Costello) made today. The Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) is starting to distance this small opposition in the federal House of Representatives from the union movement. Why is he starting to do that? Because he knows in his own mind that every time they tried to implement good policy and good procedures the ACTU, which had a voice at the cabinet table, pulled the strings. The ACTU played the puppet and said, `No, you don't do it this way; you do it our way.' So the government was hamstrung frequently.

        Back in April of 1993, we had the so-called historic win that Labor never expected to have, where Paul Keating knocked off John Hewson. On 21 April the then Prime Minister went to Melbourne and spoke to the Institute of Company Directors. He said some very important things. In describing a new model of industrial relations that he was working towards, he said:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        It is a model which places primary emphasis on bargaining at the workplace level within a framework of minimum standards provided by arbitration tribunals.

        So what happened? The former Prime Minister, Paul Keating, got busy with other affairs of state. Bill Kelty and Lindsay Fox went out into the countryside looking for jobs for young people—which was an admirable exercise—but they took their eye off the ball. The unions went absolutely mad when they realised what their industrial relations minister was going to do. Even Keating had a vision of what might happen, but the unions said no and the ACTU said no. That is this opposition's idea of a wages policy. The unions now represent only 33 per cent of the entire Australian work force and only 25 per cent of the private sector work force in Australia. That has come down very dramatically over the 13 years of a failed Labor government.

        The purpose of this bill, and the associated Dairy Produce Amendment Bill 1996, is to introduce minor but necessary amendments to ensure consistency between the current industry milk payment practices and the dairy market support legislation.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Following the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations, Australia introduced new arrangements from 1 July 1995 which deliver assistance to dairy producers through a clearly defined and transparent domestic support scheme.
       </para>
       <break page="180" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
        <para first-indent="16">
         The market support arrangements involve a levy on market milk, paid by producers; and a levy on manufacturing milk, paid by manufacturers of dairy products which can be recouped from domestic consumers. Exports of manufactured dairy products are exempt from levy liability.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The two levies are appropriated to the Australian Dairy Corporation, which pays support to manufacturing milk producers. The Australian Dairy Corporation also collects the levies as the agent of the Department of Primary Industries and Energy.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The scheme centres around being able to distinguish between market milk and manufacturing milk at the point of receival from a producer. The distinction between market milk and manufacturing milk under the current legislation is based on actual usage. Current administration of the scheme by the Australian Dairy Corporation is on the basis of industry milk payment practices and is not consistent with the legislation as it now stands.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Extensive consultation with the dairy industry has established that it would be extremely difficult for the industry to modify its current milk payment practices without causing major disruption. Accordingly, this bill retrospectively aligns the market support legislation with the existing administration arrangements of the Australian Dairy Corporation.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         This bill provides for market milk to be redefined as that milk for which a producer receives a market milk payment. Manufacturing milk will subsequently be the residual of total leviable milk less market milk. These definitional changes will ensure that the legislative framework and the current method of administration of the dairy support arrangements are compatible. They have been developed in close consultation with the dairy industry.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <break soft-hyphen="1" type="COLUMN">
          Two additional modifications have been incorporated into the bill. The first involves removing the imposition of the corporation, promotion and research levies on milk which is consumed, disposed of or lost on&amp;hyphen;farm. In practice, the amounts of such milk are indeterminate and have consequently never in curred levy. The removal of the levy liability from such milk gives legal effect to industry policy and the reality of industry practice.
         </break>
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The second modification clarifies the levy imposition arrangements for modified market milk and manufacturing milk by emphasising that levy is calculated on the milk fat and protein content of milk as determined on&amp;hyphen;farm. Again this provision ensures consistency between established industry policy and the legislation.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The proposed amendments do not affect actual levy collection and support payments, as current industry practice will continue. No producer or manufacturer will be disadvantaged relative to the current operation of the scheme. Furthermore, there will be no effect on the annual amounts of revenue and outlays under the scheme. Most importantly, the market support arrangements remain consistent with the original policy intention of the scheme and with Australia's commitments to the World Trade Organisation agreement.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         There are a couple of other points that I want to make. The first is to acknowledge the unbelievable performance of the Australian dairy industry in recent times. It has become the very model of a success story in terms of Australia's value added export sector. Not only has its performance in Asia outstripped the average performance of any other sector within the Australian economy, but even within agriculture, as I hope is well known in this House, the primary industry sector has shown a clean set of heels to the rest of the Australian economy. We need to commend it for that.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         <break page="181" soft-hyphen="1" type="PAGE">
          The second point I want to make is to record my absolute delight at being able to carry through this place the first piece of legislation under the new administration. It is the first piece of legislation put through by a coalition government for 13 years. That is indeed an honour and something in which I take enormous pride, not only on my own behalf but on behalf of my colleagues as well.

        The purpose of this bill is to give effect to the government's pre&amp;hyphen;election commitments to repeal the International Shipping (Australian&amp;hyphen;resident Seafarers) Grants Act 1995 and the Ships (Capital Grants Act) 1987. These measures will save Australian taxpayers about $52 million over the next four years.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The coalition strongly opposed the International Shipping (Australian&amp;hyphen;resident Seafarers) Grants Bill when it was debated in the parliament last October. I remind the House of how this scheme developed from the deal made by the former Prime Minister and his senior ministerial colleagues, with the ACTU and the Maritime Union of Australia, to end the shipping strike called by the Maritime Union of Australia over the sale of ANL Limited and ANL's shareholding in Australian Stevedores.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        For its part of the bargain, the MUA undertook to give serious consideration to supporting the government's proposed sale of ANL and negotiating an industrial agreement with shipowners to deliver significant cost savings. Well, we all know the story on ANL: the MUA opposed the sale tooth and nail and forced the government to back off from selling the line to P&amp;O, the only prospective buyer. Needless to say, ANL made further losses which continued to be a drain on the Australian taxpayer.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        As for the industrial agreement, the so&amp;hyphen;called maritime industry restructuring agreement, or MIRA, was duly negotiated and was supposed to produce cost savings of some $200,000 per ship per year. However, the MUA has largely failed to deliver on its commitments, with the result that the promised savings have simply evaporated.
       </para>
       <break page="182" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
        <para first-indent="16">
         One of the key elements of MIRA was for the industry to reduce the crewing factor from around 2.13 seafarers per berth to 2.0 by changes in work practices, improvements in safety and cutting out workers' compensation rorts. However, the quarterly survey by the Bureau of Transport and Communications Economics shows that over the 12 months to December 1995 the crewing factor worsened rather than improved.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Another key element of MIRA was for a peace accord to maintain an environment to minimise industrial disruption. Yet late last year, at the behest of its mates in the ACTU, the MUA took national strike action in support of a few mining industry workers at Weipa. In short, the MUA, despite the peace accord, was happy to damage its own industry and the nation as a whole in a political gesture to the power brokers of the ACTU who would rather have the MUA flex its industrial muscle than use the proper processes in the Industrial Relations Commission.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The evidence is there for all to see. The international shipping grants package has not delivered its complementary MIRA reforms; it has simply provided a windfall gain of $19 million to existing operators.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         I now turn to the repeal of the Ships (Capital Grants) Act 1987. This scheme was introduced in 1987 with an intended five&amp;hyphen;year life. In the words of the then minister, the Hon. Peter Morris, when introducing the bill, the legislation was to assist Australian ship operators to acquire modern, technologically advanced ships which could be operated at lower crewing levels. The scheme was subsequently extended another five years to June 1997. Hand in hand with this grant scheme went a generous accelerated depreciation tax concession.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         In addition to these generous subsidies and tax concessions, there has been the financial assistance to the industry through the previous government's shared funding of early retirement and voluntary redundancy packages for MUA members. The total value of all these measures over the past nine years is estimated to have been in excess of $320 million.
        </para>
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         <para first-indent="16">
          While the crew levels on Australian ships are now equivalent to international standards, the crewing factor of around 2.13, which is largely accounted for by the most generous leave system of any maritime nation, is well above the international average of around 1.7. The industry is also saddled with a costly and inefficient pooled employment system for MUA members which gives employers no right to select the most suitable, appropriately trained ratings for their shipping operations. This pooled labour system, more fitting to the 1920s than the 1990s, also denies employers the opportunity of creating a strong company ethos among staff.
         </para>

          These factors, coupled with the high wages paid to Australian seafarers, means that Australian shipping is no nearer to being internationally competitive than it was nine years ago. The Australian taxpayer cannot be expected to continue pouring capital grants into shipping when it has failed to address the serious problems impeding its development as an efficient and competitive world&amp;hyphen;class industry.

          In addition to the winding&amp;hyphen;up of the ships capital grants scheme, a bill will shortly be introduced to repeal the related accelerated depreciation provisions under section 57AM of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936. However, consistent with established practice when tax concessions are withdrawn, transitional arrangements will enable those ships that would have qualified for the capital grant had the scheme continued for the further 12 months to still qualify for the accelerated depreciation concession. This is provided that they continue to meet the compliance criteria set out in the Ships (Capital Grants) Act 1987 and are delivered to the shipowner and registered in Australia before 1 July 1997.

          I now turn to the details of the bill. The key elements of the bill are contained in schedule 1 to the bill. Item 1 of the schedule repeals the International Shipping (Australian&amp;hyphen;resident Seafarers) Grants Act 1995. In accordance with clause 2 of the bill, the repeal of the act is to take effect on 1 July 1996.

          Finally, the government has already begun consulting the shipping industry on other elements of the shipping policy reforms foreshadowed before the general election.

         The purpose of this bill is to insert into the Excise Tariff Act 1921 the definition of `prescribed division' which is currently contained in an excise by&amp;hyphen;law. The definition is necessary for determining the periods of a year for the purposes of calculating the excise duty on crude petroleum oil under three sections of the Tariff Act. The need for this legislation has arisen as a result of advice received from the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General's Department in January of this year concerning the crude oil excise provisions of the Excise Tariff Act 1921 which rely upon the by&amp;hyphen;law definition. It was suggested for clarity to transfer the by&amp;hyphen;law definition into the act with effect from 1 July 1983, being the date the relevant provision which relies upon the by&amp;hyphen;law definition first appeared in legislation.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The transfer of the by&amp;hyphen;law definition and its retrospective commencement is proposed as a technical amendment pursuant to the Attorney&amp;hyphen;General's Department's advice, to ensure there is no doubt about the validity of past revenue collections under the definition—item 2 of schedule 1 to the bill refers. The bill also effects a technical drafting amendment to the Tariff Act relating to gender neutral language, consistent with continuing Commonwealth drafting policy to make appropriate amendments where necessary in Commonwealth legislation to achieve a gender neutral result—item 1 of schedule 1 to the bill refers.

        I represent the Country Liberal Party in the Northern Territory and I would refer honourable members to the fact sheet which was distributed by the officers of the parliament. When you see the breakdown of the members of this parliament, you will see that the Country Liberal Party is listed as a single item with a total of one member. I am the coalition member representing the Country Liberal Party in the House of Representatives. Of course, we do have a senator who is a member of the Country Liberal Party. I refer to Senator Grant Tambling who has been in the Senate for a number of years.

        I must advise you, Mr Deputy Speaker, that the Country Liberal Party in the Northern Territory is one of Australia's most successful political parties. It was elected to power at the first Northern Territory Assembly elections in 1974 and has been in power for those 22 years. At the conclusion of its current term in 1998 it will probably become the longest serving political party of any state government in Australia.

         The Country Liberal Party was very instrumental in my being elected to this parliament. Without the party's help and that of its members in the branches throughout the Northern Territory I would not be here today. I must thank each and every member of the Country Liberal Party who worked very hard to ensure my success. I would also like to take this opportunity to thank my electorate for having faith in me in terms of representing them at this very, very interesting time of Northern Territory constitutional change and development.

        <para first-indent="16">
         Obviously, I have had some previous experience in parliament by being a member of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. I was a member of what we called the class of 1974. I retired from that parliament in 1994 to take time out to recharge my batteries and to seek preselection and, hopefully, once I had preselection, to go on and win the seat. I am happy to say that I did receive preselection in May 1995. I worked very hard with a lot of my former colleagues in the Northern Territory. Obviously I was successful.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The important thing is the Northern Territory's profile in terms of where we are today. The Northern Territory is 1.3 million square kilometres large. It is the largest electorate in terms of electors in the Australian region. I have 97,000&amp;hyphen;plus on my electoral roll. That makes it the largest electorate in that sense. In terms of land mass, I know that the seat of Kalgoorlie—which stretches from the Great Australian Bight to the Kimberleys—is the largest electorate in Australia when calculated in land mass. But tonight, I would like to claim that the Northern Territory electorate, with its boundaries, is the largest in Australia by virtue of the fact that there is a water boundary from the coast of Western Australia to the Indian Ocean island territories which are part of the Northern Territory federal electoral boundaries.

         The aspirations of the territorians are really that we have security, growth, progress, new wealth, protection, an enhancement of our lifestyle, a good standard of living, a future for our children and a society that recognises the rights of individuals.

          At the same time, the Northern Territory has probably one of the best examples of multiculturalism. The Northern Territory is made up of many ethnic communities—totalling more than 60. When moving around the Northern Territory, it is not difficult to realise that 51 per cent of the population born in the Northern Territory are non-Anglo&amp;hyphen;Saxon. Considering that 25 per cent of Northern Territorians are Aboriginal and indigenous, it certainly does give us the best mix in what we would consider to be a rich mix of cultures in the Northern Territory.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          We also have a young population. Some say that 60 per cent of the population of the Northern Territory is under the age of 40, and some 70 per cent of that group is under the age of 25. So we must be mindful when we try to formulate our policies and we must make sure that the considerations of the young are taken into account.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          When we speak about the young, we obviously speak about the young people who are working in the Northern Territory and the two&amp;hyphen;income families who have great problems and difficulties with child-care places. I am told by constituents that, if you have two children in your family and you want to get those children into the same child-care centre, you have a better chance of winning Tattslotto. I think that is disgraceful.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          At the same time, we can identify with the fact that, within the next three to five years, some 500 people in the Northern Territory will require additional aged care facilities, whether they be by way of hospices, villages or clinics. The important thing, I believe, is that we need to establish more facilities for our senior citizens, and that is something that I will be working very, very hard to achieve.
         </para>
         <para first-indent="16">
          If we do not keep our senior citizens in the territory, they will leave and, because of the extended family situation in the territory, they will take their families with them to other parts of Australia. At the same time, I am aware that the Chief Minister, Shane Stone, is having very serious discussions with our Minister for Immigration and Multicultural Affairs (Mr Ruddock) to try to work out a particular program to encourage migration to the Northern Territory.

           A lot of you who were members of parliament years ago might have remembered when Ian Macphee was the federal minister for immigration. He tried to put in a scheme—which in those days was called the NUMAS scheme—to encourage migration to remote parts of Australia, including the Northern Territory, the northern part of Western Australia and, I think, even Tasmania. He tried to get more people to go to those areas. Without that sort of population growth, the Northern Territory would have obviously taken a lot longer to develop. My job is to use my best endeavours to make sure that the aspirations of the territory are met.

           That brings me to statehood. Of course, constitutional changes started in 1974 with our first fully elected parliament, of which I was a member. The first major constitutional changes started in 1978 when we were given self-government. We were then able to make determinations and decisions in the Northern Territory, because we were territorians elected to represent other territorians.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           In 1996, some 22 years later, the advent of statehood has certainly been deterred, I believe, by the last 13 years of Labor government. We were given some encouragement in 1975 when the Prime Minister of Australia, the Hon. Malcolm Fraser, said at that time that the Northern Territory could have statehood within five years. Of course, being new in terms of where we were going towards constitutional development, we said, `No. We don't think that timetable is a good timetable. We will need more time to establish our bona fides before we move into that final stage.'
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           We have been treated as a state in a financial sense since 1988, so that does not inhibit us from moving forward. Of course, economic development—which I hope to be able to speak about a bit more tonight—has certainly given the Northern Territory a great impetus for that final stage of constitutional change.

           The biggest factor that not so much confuses people but makes them hesitant is that they are asked, `If you become a state, do you want 12 senators?' With a population of 185,000 in the Northern Territory, it would be quite unrealistic to expect at statehood that we should finish up with 12 senators. At the time,
           <break page="186" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
            my predecessor in this place did say in his maiden speech that, when the territory becomes a state, we should not have fewer senators than the other states. I believe that he may have been wrong in that assumption.

          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           If we go back and look at when Australia became a federation in 1901, we see that each of the states were given six senators, and I believe that the Northern Territory should start by having at least six senators. The reasoning behind that idea of our forefathers was that, by granting six senators to the smaller states with a smaller population base, the bigger states would not be able to kick them around.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           In 1996 there is talk about a constitutional change and statehood for the territory by the year 2001. I believe that is too far away and we could put programs in place before then. I am told that section 121 of the constitution will allow this parliament to give the Northern Territory statehood, provided we can reach an arrangement in Senate representation.
          </para>
          <para first-indent="16">
           I believe that the territory should not start with fewer than six senators. Then a timetable—whether it be gauged on growth or population—could be put in place to allow the territory to reach its full maturity in representation. It is not a matter of if; it is now a matter of when. I certainly hope that the timetable is accelerated before the year 2001.

           In terms of the legislative process in the Northern Territory, we are subject to the power of veto by the Commonwealth. We have been since 1974. I am happy to say that in the last 22 years not one piece of legislation passed by territorians has ever been rejected by the Commonwealth. In 1901 the states all had six senators. We were part of South Australia in 1901. In 1910 the South Australians could not handle the development of the north and they gave it back. The territory was formulated in 1911 and we have been under Commonwealth control since then. The Northern Territory, with one&amp;hyphen;sixth of the Australian land mass, should be a state before the year 2001. I would be very proud if I could be the House of Representatives member who tabled the constitution for the Northern Territory.

            Land rights, obviously, is a very important issue in the Northern Territory. My position will be to influence policy development and to have a legislative program in favour of economic and social development in the Northern Territory, remembering that 40 per cent of Australia's export income is generated north of the Tropic of Capricorn. I was very pleased to see that the Governor-General in his speech yesterday said that the Commonwealth government would make sure that our indigenous communities are part of that development.

I acknowledge that during the election campaign the coalition foreshadowed that it was going to amend the Native Title Act. I am pleased to say that in the Governor-General's speech it has been foreshadowed that amendments are going to take place to native title. That is very important because there is a lot of confusion in the remote parts of the Northern Territory and in other parts of Australia. People are looking for a finalisation of this matter.

            We have two land councils in the Northern Territory—the Northern Land Council and the Central Land Council. It divides the territory in half. I think it is wrong. It is now time to establish smaller land councils. Aboriginal communities want smaller land councils so they can determine their own future and wellbeing. A large land council in the Top End dictates what happens in half of the Northern Territory. I invite honourable members who have never been to the Northern Territory to come and see for themselves first-hand the implications of the very large areas we have. Aboriginals in some parts of the territory cannot talk about land in another part of the territory which is not part of them. Land, for Aboriginals, is their mother. If I live in one section of the Northern Territory and I am part of a land council I really should not be talking about other parts of that land as far as they are concerned. Smaller land councils will ensure far greater development in terms of land ownership.

             I turn to Kakadu and Uluru. Obviously I am not going to have time to finish what I have set out to do today. I will probably use the grievance debate to pick up other points that I do not get through tonight. With Kakadu and Uluru we are talking about management of those two parks. We are not talking about ownership. The Northern Territory Parks and Wildlife Service have good management models. I believe they have done an excellent job since 1978. Katherine, which is the major national park, is on Aboriginal land and the Katherine Gorge is managed by the Northern Territory Parks and Wildlife Service. Territorians do not understand why Canberra wants to run our parks. Can't we be trusted? We believe we can. We know that we must consult with traditional owners both at Kakadu and Uluru.

             There are 4.7 million hectares of park in the Northern Territory and 2.1 million of those are just Uluru and Kakadu. There are 12 other parks in the remainder, which the Northern Territory government controls and runs very well through its parks and wildlife service. The maintenance of these large parks is an enormous problem. My advice is that Kakadu is deteriorating under federal supervision. Some waterways are becoming polluted with an introduced feral aquatic plant, salvina molesta. There is also mimosa pigra. A feral pig program also needs great attention.

             The Northern Territory government has its own programs. Kakadu, with its area and waterways, and other waterways are controlled by the Northern Territory government. If they are working on these problems in our waterways and if at the same time that is not happening in Kakadu, then everybody is wasting their time. There needs to be a coordinated approach.

             Mr Deputy Speaker, you may remember a headline about my wanting to go out to the tollbooth with a sledgehammer. Symbolically speaking, that is what I wanted to do because tollbooths in the parks, as far as we are concerned, are not the way to go if we are going to encourage tourism. But let me talk about ANCA. In 1975 ANCA started in this country with a staff of six and a budget of just over $1 million. In 1996, expenditure on
             <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
              Kakadu and Uluru is some $8 million—just to run those two parks. The total budget for the territory, as I understand it, is about $23 million. The whole budget for ANCA in 1994-95 was $75 million, and plus the $11 million that it collects makes a total of $85 million. It now has some 460 officers, of whom 349 are full-time. In regard to the aid spent on those parks, the Northern Territory could do a far better job with its National Parks and Wildlife Service than ANCA.

It was in the South Alligator Rivers Region and the park came afterwards. ERA has been there since 1974. Kakadu was not declared until 1979.

        The Namadgi area has a very rich heritage. A rock shelter just north of the Namadgi National Park contains evidence that Aboriginal people were living in the region during the last ice age around 20,000 years ago.

         I have a long association with the Namadgi area, both professionally and at a personal level. As a result, I have had the privilege in participating in the growth and development of one of the fastest growing urban areas in Australia. My electorate is like any other urban electorate in the country. It shares the same problems and its residents have the same aspirations for themselves and their families. I believe that the Namadgi electorate embodies the spirit of modern day Canberra. It was not so long ago that Canberra was limestone plains, but now in a relatively short time Canberra has developed into a modern and diverse community. The Namadgi area has likewise developed in this fashion. It is part of the whole, but a very distinct part.

Its tallest mountain, Bimberi Peak, is only 318 metres below Australia's highest, Mount Kosciusko.

          The Tuggeranong Town Centre is beginning to develop into a healthy work base for the electorate.

As a direct result of this strong public sector growth, the electorate now has a variety of retail, commercial and community facilities that meet the demands of an ever&amp;hyphen;growing population.

           through reducing Public Service numbers. It may be politically expedient to talk about cutting back government spending by reducing the number of public servants, but, as the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) has pointed out on many occasions recently, the Public Service wages bill makes up only a very small component of total public sector outlay. So the scope for significant savings is minimal, but the impact of those savings is widespread. The government has offered no explanation of the link between public sector cutbacks and national prosperity. It seems to believe that one person's job loss is another person's tax cut.

          Whilst I am not advocating protection of the Public Service for the sake of it, I strongly believe in the need to maintain a Public Service which is efficient, professional and driven by a high standard of service delivery. The Labor government undertook significant reform of the Public Service, increasing productivity and efficiency. The Service is to be congratulated for the way in which it adapted to meet the former government's reforms. In contrast, the coalition's approach appears to be driven by a narrow focus on that dollar bottom line. The result of this approach will be inefficiencies and a diminution of the previously very high standards. Morale in the service will be severely affected.

         <para first-indent="16">
          I have always believed that whenever there is a need to reduce job numbers it must be done with levels of service delivery as the paramount concern. The question I put to the new government is this: at what cost to the community are these public sector savings being made? That is the aspect of the equation that the government appears to ignore. There is no doubt that the cost will be increased workloads and excessive demands on individual public servants. But what of the reduction in the quality and type of community service, that is, the service to our community? Surely any responsible government would see the absolute arrogance of making substantial cuts to the Public Service without even publicly acknowledging their impact. Implementing destructive policy in complete isolation of the consequences typifies the sort

          This government must also publicly recognise that people will be directly affected by these cuts. When we speak of these effects, we are not referring to a list of undefinable values in the middle of an equation or a balance sheet. We are not simply talking about proposed targets for a departmental head to meet. We are talking about thousands of men and women throughout the country who will no longer have a job to go to because the government of the day believes that the only way to meet a budget target based on inexact forward estimates is to simply throw people out of work.

          With all the attention on Canberra, people fail to realise the impact these cuts will have in regional Australia. Contrary to popular belief, the government of Australia is not all in Canberra. In fact, only about one in five Commonwealth employees is based in the ACT. Quite often, the Commonwealth public servants employed in regional areas help to form the backbone of their local community. They are the ones who actively participate in their local community—the school fetes and the sporting events. They spend their incomes in their local region. I wonder whether three of my colleagues on the other side—the Leader of the National Party of Australia (Mr Tim Fischer), the Minister for Transport and Regional Development (Mr Sharp) and the honourable member for Eden&amp;hyphen;Monaro (Mr Nairn) are aware of the social and economic effects on their electorates if, for example, the local CES or DSS offices are closed.

          It would be cynical to suggest that the government's silence on the ramifications of its approach to the Public Service indicates a lack of ideas on its part as to how to deal with the effects of such a decision. I take it as given that a responsible government would at least be prepared to deal with the consequences of its actions. I hope, for the sake of the people in my electorate and others who will suffer the inevitable effects, that my cynicism is unfounded.

        Mr Deputy Speaker, I address you today with humility, aware that a great responsibility rests on my shoulders. The mighty seat of Dawson, a rural and regional seat in North Queensland, the largest sugar seat in Australia, has chosen only its fourth member since the seat was proclaimed in 1949.

It takes in the mining towns of Collinsville and Glenden. The principal centre is Mackay, followed by Ayr, Home Hill, Bowen, Proserpine, Sarina and the glorious Whitsundays. Dawson pays its way. With only 0.7 per cent of Australia's population, it has four per cent of Australia's exports. A Dawson person is six times more effective in producing exports for this great country than is the average Australian. Dawson is the sweetest seat in Australia. Half of all Australia's sugar is grown in my seat and 80 per cent of that is exported.

If you have not had a holiday in North Queensland, do yourself a favour and come to the Whitsundays. It is absolutely magnificent there. But we have a difficulty because we do not have access to the tourist areas in Dawson. That is something that I have pledged to rectify while I am the federal member.

No matter where you travel around Dawson, you hear the same thing: Ray is honest, he works hard and he has great integrity. He made what I think is the greatest sacrifice any federal member can make for constituents: he gave up his personal ambitions for his electorate. In 1992 when Ray was the shadow minister for aged care, the coalition had a policy of reducing the sugar tariff to negligible levels by the year 2000. Ray resigned his shadow ministry for his electorate and set a standard of representation that I and many others can aspire to.

It is important to remember that democracy has, however, its own capacity for tyranny. The existence of democracy does not indicate liberty among citizens. It is unfortunately the case that some of the most menacing encroachments upon liberty invoke the democratic principle and assert the right to majority rule.

In chapter 39 of the Magna Carta is found the famous phrase `by the law of land'. Chapter 39 states:

That decision was made after the Minister for the Environment (Senator Hill) granted an exemption from the need for an environmental impact statement, which was otherwise required under the provisions of the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974. Those administrative procedures involved in the EIS process would have facilitated constituents with the opportunity of presenting argument as to the detriment they are suffering, and will continue to suffer, from the re-opening of the runway, and measures which should have been taken by the government before any such action was taken.

         —Thank you, Mr Deputy Speaker, and congratulations to you on your appointment. I appreciate the chance to make this speech at the first opportunity. Mr Deputy Speaker, you would be hard pressed, as most members here would be, to name the most widely known Aboriginal name in politics. Although for some time many could not pronounce the word, it became a household talking point earlier this year. The word you are all thinking about is also the name of a suburb of Australia's largest tropical city, Townsville. It is the name of a Queensland state electorate. The word, of course, is now part of my state's history—Mundingburra. Mundingburra and its new state member, Frank Tanti, will be remembered for a very long time.

        Mundingburra, too, is very special to me. As a Townsville city councillor, I have represented that suburb for the past 11 years and I now represent Mundingburra at the federal level. As you all know, Mundingburra recently changed the government of Queensland. It focused the national spotlight on the capital city of northern Australia. Today, I again direct the national spotlight to Townsville.

Ministers and members alike need to know and understand that Townsville will be Australia's brightest star for some years to come. Its future is supported by mineral deposits of world significance, by marine science, earth science and tropical medicine research of world significance, and by a government infrastructure such as Australia's largest defence base.

The President of the Townsville Chamber of Commerce, Mal Missingham, has provided me with a list of 12 projects committed for completion over the next three years. Together, these 12 projects represent nearly $1 billion worth of investment flowing right now in the Townsville pipeline.

        Townsville already has a nickel refinery and a copper refinery. A start on a major zinc refinery is only a matter of months away. When completed, the Korea Zinc project will be a $1 billion development in our city—probably the largest single Korean investment outside of Korea. There is a clear message here for both the government and the people of Townsville. In a sense, Korea Zinc is an acid test for North Queensland. The success of this major development will, in effect, be

         Locally, the Townsville and Thuringowa city councils have the prime responsibility to immediately address the issues of availability of suitably zoned land, the timely provision of water and waste water services and the giving of attention to waste disposal issues. In particular, water and land issues need immediate attention. In addition, I have asked both local authorities to consider establishing a sister city link with Korea. I have advised the mayors that federal funds are available to assist with this. It is an inexpensive `must do' project.

        The state government, for its part, must urgently approve the construction of a base load power station for the city, and it must also ensure that rail and port infrastructure will meet the needs of the coming development. The federal government can contribute through customs and immigration policies that reduce red tape and through contributions to national infrastructure to serve the region. This government can also take the lead in organising local high&amp;hyphen;level trade missions to Korea. I have already spoken to Australia's ambassador in Korea in this regard. There is, for example, also the potential to export cattle feed from the Burdekin to Korea.

        The new projects I speak of will provide thousands of jobs—thousands of jobs—new road and rail access to the Townsville port, many new secondary industries and value added production generating many more export dollars for our country.

         As well, Townsville is on the doorstep of the Bowen Basin gas deposits and the Pentland coal reserves.

         I now turn to the need to improve port access. It is clear that a new road-rail access servicing the industrial developments south-east of the city must be provided. The current favoured proposal is to build a new dual link, crossing Ross River near its mouth and extending south-east out of Townsville. This $75 million project provides direct access to the port with minimal impact on existing residential development.

         However, there are several matters our community needs to think about. For example, if the fishing fleet were relocated lower down the river, the need to provide an opening rail and road bridge would be eliminated thereby reducing the costs and river traffic delays. Secondly, a strong case could be made to return all port authority land—except for a dedicated road-rail corridor—on the southern bank of the river to an environmental park. Thirdly, I believe that the existing port access for Queensland Nickel and the northern beaches needs to be preserved.

         Townsville is also looming as a centre for major advancement in airfreight operations, particularly of perishable goods.

         There is a business opportunity for the establishment of cold storage export facilities at Townsville airport.

Of course, all this takes money, but the benefits extend well beyond airfreight.

         Improvements would also be a perfect stepping stone to better international airport facilities at Townsville airport. The major jump-off points for international airlines have always been Brisbane and, in recent years, Cairns. The standard of air service, however, between Cairns and Townsville and between Brisbane and Townsville should be seriously re&amp;hyphen;evaluated and money invested in feasibility studies for these necessary upgrades for Townsville airport. In this respect, the tourism industry in the Townsville region would also benefit enormously.

         Moving on to live exports of another kind, Townsville stands to benefit from the great progress made in recent years in the area of live cattle exports. Live cattle exports are the only shining light in an Australian beef industry that continues to suffer from drought and low prices. This growth has been directly linked to growth in the demand for beef in South&amp;hyphen;East Asia—specifically, Indonesia and the Philippines. As Asia's taste for beef grows—and it has been growing rapidly—the demand for packaged, processed and frozen beef will also increase. In areas of Australia where live cattle exports are made from, this has also resulted in growth in frozen and

         With the new port access in place Townsville residents should have no fear about issues of amenity. Cattle can be railed directly from the Charters Towers district to the port without having to be held in the city. A North Queensland live cattle export enhancement program, initiated by the North Queensland Beef Research Council, is nearing completion. NQBRC have been working closely with the North Queensland Economic Development Board, the Queensland Department of Primary Industries and the Australian Meat and Livestock Corporation on that project, the aim of which is to improve grazier and buyer live cattle market education and initiate direct trade delegations to South&amp;hyphen;East Asia. The program will help pave the way for further growth in North Queensland for live cattle exports, and Townsville is perfectly situated to capitalise on this growth.

Townsville's celebration attracted thousands of veterans, visitors, official guests and media from around the world, and was recognised as the centrepiece of the nationwide Australia Remembers campaign. Indeed, it proved to be the genesis of the campaign.

One constant theme clearly stood out in those speeches and that was that it was high time that Townsville, Herbert and North Queensland received the recognition and due attention from the federal government that they deserved.

         It was a Friday morning and the phone rang—as phones tend to in members' offices—and it was an elderly lady in quite a deal of distress. Her sister—a lady in her late eighties—had fallen ill at home while caring for her bedridden spouse.

        Science has always been critical to the development of Australia. I think anyone who understands the nature of the Australian continent—we have a very large resource base and a large land mass but a relatively small population by world standards—will understand the importance of science to this country. Science has always underpinned our place in the world. A very creative and innovative approach to basic science has always underpinned the mining activities in this country as well as agriculture, manufacturing and environmental management. Science is one of our greatest national assets. It helps us to exploit the many other natural assets which this country has and, in doing so, it uses one of our other great natural assets: the people of this country and their skills.

        How are we going to continue to maintain this very innovative and creative approach which Australians have always brought to science and to the management of it in their country? We have always had a very strong commitment from the public sector. Our public sector science has always been very strong and it has specialised in basic and strategic research which, over the period of the Labor government, increased by some 60 per cent in real terms over that last decade. The CSIRO enjoyed an increase of some 23 per cent in that same period in real terms, and university research has increased by some 164 per cent since 1983. Those are the statistics. They underpin the very strong commitment of the Labor government to science in this country in its various guises and, in particular—as my remarks later will highlight—the importance of basic university research and the funding which has been provided to that in recent years.

If we are to continue to exploit the advantages which we have—those eminent natural resources on which this country has grown for the last century or more—then we will need to combine more innovation in our research and development, in our civilian science and in the way in which business applies those techniques to manufacturing, agriculture, mining and all of the other assets that this country has.

        Honourable members who served with me in the last parliament on the Standing Committee on Industry, Science and Technology of this House—I hope to see it re-established in this parliament because I think it performed a very valuable service in the last and previous parliaments—will be aware of the value of innovation to this country. Innovation has always been a very important part of our psyche and development, but we have failed in the past to adequately target and identify ways in which government and the private sector can contribute to innovation in this country.

        South Australia has a lot to gain from investment and research on water quality, as Australia generally does, and I know that the CRC which we recently opened in South Australia will return that investment by the public and private sectors many times over. I was certainly struck at the launch of that CRC by the significant number of private sector companies which were prepared to invest their own dollars in that research effort. I am sure that it will certainly repay them, as it will the people of Australia. But how did that process become established? How was that kicked off? Obviously by the very significant leadership and financial commitment of the government sector. Without that investment by the public sector, those private companies would not have had the opportunity to be part of a very exciting research centre.

        In May of 1988, 12 Sydney businessmen of Italian origin formed the Italian Affair Committee for the purpose of assisting the Spastic Centre of New South Wales in providing services for babies, children and adults with physical disabilities throughout our state. What began as a very successful exercise in

         raising donations for the centre's work in general had by 1993 developed into a joint project with the Spastic Centre aimed at establishing a new branch of the organisation in south&amp;hyphen;western Sydney.

       <para first-indent="16">
        Known as the `growthpoint project', the Italian Affair Committee became responsible not only for organising the construction of a new centre for disabled people in the greater western Sydney suburbs but also for its financing. Without knowing it, the committee had embarked on bringing the largest community project ever undertaken in Australia to fruition. Of course, time has shown that they not only did so but did it with style.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        Firstly, they managed to elicit the donation of a parcel of land from Fairfield City Council for the building of the centre. Next, they coordinated hundreds of local businesses and tradespeople to give their time, expertise and materials for free in the construction of the building. Finally, the committee approached local clubs, businesses and community groups to donate money to assist in the financing of the project.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        By October last year when the then Prime Minister, the Hon. Paul Keating, officially opened the building, the Italian Affair Committee had not only been successful in getting the centre up and running for the hundreds of disabled people and their families who live in western Sydney but had also managed to raise approximately $3.5 million for the construction of the new regional centre in the process—this from a total of some $6 million raised by the committee for the New South Wales Spastic Centre over the last seven years.

        The centre has some 67 rooms specially built and designed to cater for young people with cerebral palsy. The building of the centre became one of the defining moments of my community. Ordinary Australians gave their time and effort to get the new regional centre off the ground. The Italian Affair Committee inspired people not only to give their physical support to the project but also to dig deep into their pockets in order to turn a dream into a reality.

        As someone very closely involved with the committee, I was determined to see that these individuals received some sort of recognition for their selfless and inspiring acts. I subsequently nominated the group for an Advance Australia Foundation award and am now extremely pleased to report that in February this year it was announced that the nomination had been successful and that the Italian Affair Committee would receive a foundation award for community service.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        That, unfortunately, is where my story begins to turn sour. The Advance Australia Foundation awards were introduced in 1980 to recognise publicly individuals and groups in the community for their outstanding contributions to Australia's people and its way of life. When the committee and I were informed of the honour to be bestowed upon them we were delighted. The award had been offered to these 12 men as a group and so we expected, once the arrangements for the awards ceremony had been made, to receive invitations for all of them. What a shock to find that only one member of the 12 and I received an invitation. I thought that there had to be a mistake.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        My office contacted the Advance Australia Foundation immediately and alerted them to the error. Only it was not an error. The foundation had deliberately decided to recognise the achievements of all 12 men by asking only one to the ceremony. Was it because there was no room at Government House? No. Government House informed my office that they were happy to have all 12 and their spouses attend. Did it have something to do with the New South Wales Premier and his recent changes to the role of Government House? No. The Premier's Department had no problem with the 12 attending.
       </para>
       <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
        <para first-indent="16">
         The finger ultimately came to point at the Advance Australia Foundation itself. It was the foundation that would not extend the hand of friendship to all of the 12 and to their wives to share tea and biscuits with the Governor of New South Wales. I even offered to pay for the tea and biscuits. And the reason? According to a letter I received from James Malone, chief executive of the foundation, the decision was taken to `keep the numbers attending the ceremonies to within a manageable limit'.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         The Italian Affair Committee is unique. It organises and works collectively—not as one chief and his 11 little indians. Decisions and responsibilities are equally shared and so it is entirely appropriate that any recognition of its work should be attended by the entire committee and not just a single officer. The foundation, with its head in the sand, still cannot see this and so I, and I hope the committee, will no longer be attending the ceremony.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         It was a shame that this chapter had to be written. But now, thank goodness, the chapter can finally be closed. The Italian Affair Committee will continue with its fundraising efforts while its legacy, the Spastic Centre at Prairiewood, will continue to thrive. It is the foundation's loss that these wonderful men and their wives will not be at the ceremony. It is a stain on the foundation's name that after giving the award to recognise the actions of 12 men it cannot stand the price of a few extra cups of tea and another packet of biscuits to honour them in the correct fashion.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Despite the bad taste that has been left in all of our mouths by this episode, I am still very glad that I nominated the Italian Affair Committee for its award and I am very pleased to know that it won. I am sure that members of this House would support me in congratulating the Italian Affair Committee on its fine work.

        I attended a meeting convened by a Bendigo family who invited a number of other parents from surrounding districts.

I raised this issue with the Keating government at the time and got very little response. That is why today's announcement by the new Prime Minister, the Hon. John Howard, that he would set up a prime ministerial youth homeless task force brought great appreciation from me. I am sure it will be appreciated by the parents who convened that meeting some years ago.

It is a very important task that they have been asked to undertake by the Prime Minister. I feel sure that we will come up with some answers. One of the issues that they will need to address is young people being encouraged by some organisations to leave home. They will look at all those departments that have been encouraging young people to leave their homes and the protectiveness of their families.

         , which was painted in 1856. The painting is one of the artist's earliest works and is very significant to Geelong's history. It depicts the area five years after the discovery of gold in Victoria. At that time Geelong was experiencing a surge in its economy, stimulated by the influx of people heading to Ballarat in search of gold and also by the export of wool from its productive western district hinterland through the port of Geelong.

        There are several issues raised by the sale of this work to foreign buyers.

         —I congratulate you, Mr Speaker, on your appointment. It is always a pleasure to come into this chamber as part of a strong, vital and youthful government and, as part of such, I will enjoy addressing you for the next three years. As my fellow members are quite aware, my electorate spans Perth's northern suburbs and is home to more than 100,000 people, all very dedicated to their local member. Although I do not presume to be in the same league as my electorate's namesake, Mrs Edith Dircksey Cowan, I do share many of her philosophies and her personal sense of motivation. Ms Edith Cowan is possibly best known to each of you, indeed to most Australians, as the face on the new $50 note, one of which I have just borrowed from my colleague.
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para first-indent="16">
        The new $50 note shows an open, honest and sensitive face accompanied by some smaller illustrations. However, this recognition is really only the postscript to a most remarkable story—a story which commenced on 2 August 1861 in Geraldton, Western Australia, with the birth of baby Edith; an event which was to have a profound effect on the shaping of thought, policy and legislation in Western Australia, if not Australia.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In 1897, nearly 100 years ago, Edith married James Cowan, the brother of one of her early teachers. It was during her husband James's appointment as police magistrate that Mrs Cowan became interested in social questions, the franchise for women, day nurseries and the boarding&amp;hyphen;out system.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In 1915, she was appointed as member of the bench of the newly appointed Children's Court—on which she was to sit for a further 18 years. In 1920, she became a justice of the peace and subsequently was given an OBE. By 12 March 1921, following the Western Australian state election, she had the honour of becoming the first woman member of any parliament in Australia.

       <break page="208" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
        <para first-indent="16">
         Considered a forceful speaker, Mrs Cowan was responsible for, and succeeded in, amending the Administration Act so that mothers were placed on equal footing with fathers when their children died intestate, and introducing the Women's Legal Status Act which aimed at abolishing the restrictions of entry of women to civil office, occupation and to practise law.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         After leaving parliament, Mrs Cowan channelled a great deal of her energies into the National Council of Women, became a freemason, had delegate status to the Sixth International Conference of Women in Washington, and was the first woman appointed to the Provincial Synod of Western Australia. Mrs Cowan was also a member of the Perth Hospital Board, and one of the founders of the Western Australian Historical Society.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Undeniably, Mrs Cowan was an amazing Australian, an amazing woman and an amazing humanitarian. I very much admire her dogged and spirited approach to the real issues, and I respect and support her overriding commitment to eliminating injustice in our community. It is somewhat ironic that these underlying values—in all her work—were established not in the materialistic 1980s, or even in the preceding few decades before this, but in the early 1920s!

        <para first-indent="16">
         Mr Speaker, I bring this to your attention not as a history lesson for my fellow members but to alert you first and foremost to the considerable efforts and talent of Australia's first woman parliamentarians and also to alert you to the fact that this year marks 75 years since Mrs Cowan was first elected to parliament. This is a benchmark of considerable significance and one which should be noted by this House on behalf of all Australians.
        </para>
        <para first-indent="16">
         Further, I believe that Mrs Cowan could rightly be considered as a catalyst to the reform process which today affords this House and state parliaments of Australia. Mrs Cowan recognised the fact that gender should not be a prerequisite for assuming ability, potential or wealth. This effort and thought has been translated into real terms in that today we have 46 women, in all, represented in this parliament. Simply put, this represents
         <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
          20.5 per cent of this parliament. This figure, although less than I would personally prefer, recognises the fact that these women have entered parliament not through some arbitrary figure, fact or formula, but through hard work, solid personal performance, a commitment to excellence and a strong skill base.

         This year we celebrate the largest contingency of women parliamentarians ever to enter any Australian parliament. This year we celebrate 75 years of women's participation in public office. This year we celebrate the 75th anniversary of Edith Cowan being the first woman to enter parliament in Australia.

         —I would like to join in some of the comments made by the honourable member for Bendigo (Mr Reid) about the tremendous work of the Salvation Army because, as he quite correctly remarked, very shortly there will be the Red Shield appeal which is their major annual fundraising exercise. As the City Chairman for Wanneroo, closely involved with the Red Shield appeal in my region, I take a great deal of pleasure in acknowledging some of the key people in the Wanneroo City appeal team. Of course, I look forward to a successful outcome in my second term as the City Chairman for Wanneroo.

        First of all, I acknowledge Captain Neil Venables from the Heathridge Citadel of the Salvation Army. Neil and his family are tremendous community people. The Heathridge Citadel serves a very large area that has a large number of families in which there are, in some instances, financial hardships and social problems. They do an extraordinarily good job of making sure that they play their part in assisting to alleviate the sorts of common social problems that go hand in hand with these types of things.

       <para first-indent="16">
        I might add that during the last financial year they suffered some quite significant problems in their government funding. That is something that occurred as a result of the fudging of the unemployment figures, because the funding was based on the unemployment for the region. Of course, as the previous
        <break page="209" soft-hyphen="0" type="PAGE">
         government tried to conceal the unemployed through various schemes, then they in fact artificially lowered the threshold for the Salvation Army's funding. That meant in Heathridge they had a shortfall.

I would also point out that Lieutenant Paul Hately is at the Merriwa Citadel in Merriwa looking after the needs of a very fast growing community. My electorate is one of the fastest growing regions in the country, and in Merriwa, Clarkson and Butler, the brand new suburb developments in my electorate extraordinarily large numbers of new families with children, many of whom are in lower income brackets, are coming into the electorate, coming into these areas needing that sort of help.

        Secondly, Mr Speaker, I would like to support the comments made earlier today by the Prime Minister (Mr Howard) and the Leader of the Opposition (Mr Beazley) in relation to gun control. As somebody said in the last few days, one can make knee&amp;hyphen;jerk reactions. But as a former policeman in Western Australia, someone who had a job in the supervision and regulation of firearms licensing and the like, I am conscious of the fact that although in Western Australia we had a very tight and quite strict firearms licence regime, we found it very difficult from time to time when we came across people who had come from other states—in particular, Queensland, where it appears that firearms are much easier to obtain.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I give the example of when I was a uniformed constable at Subiaco. A young fellow of about 22 or 23 arrived in the station. He was doing the right thing, he was being a
        <break soft-hyphen="0" type="COLUMN">
         good citizen. He had actually driven across from Queensland in his ute with a semi&amp;hyphen;automatic firearm hanging up in the back of the ute all the way from wherever he had come from in Queensland. He brought the gun in to get it licensed. Of course, we immediately seized it and pointed out to him that, in fact, he had committed an offence ever since he had arrived in Western Australia. Obviously having done the right thing and brought the firearm in, we were conscious that he had done his citizenship bit or duty to try to get himself licensed in Western Australia.
        </break>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        In this particular case, when we asked him why he wanted to have this firearm in the future, he said he was travelling in Western Australia and he needed it just in case he got into trouble. We were not quite sure exactly what sort of trouble he was likely to get into. But, quite clearly, as the Prime Minister has indicated, with a council of police ministers coming up shortly there is a need for not only uniform national gun laws but also a national register of firearms—that is quite clearly now a very important element—and a comprehensive ban on semi&amp;hyphen;automatic firearms.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I cannot, for the life of me, see any reason for anyone in Australia, other than a member of the armed services or the police or someone in some other emergency capacity, to own and possess a semi&amp;hyphen;automatic firearm. It is, quite clearly, time for all semi&amp;hyphen;automatic firearms to be banned and probably time for an amnesty to allow those people who still have them to hand them in without fear of being prosecuted.
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        I conclude by saying that I subscribe to the bipartisan views of the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition. Quite clearly, the national government now has a fundamental role in ensuring there are uniform national firearm laws.

        In the address&amp;hyphen;in&amp;hyphen;reply debate, one of the most important segments of my speech was to be economic factors; but, unfortunately, I did not get to it. When we think about the economic sectors of the Northern Territory we have to think about the mining sector, the tourism sector, Asian trade, the gas pipeline, defence, primary industry and the horticulture industry.

         —And motherhood, yes. We will get to statehood at some other stage. The important thing is that the Northern Territory cannot be quarantined from the Commonwealth cuts that are likely to happen. It would be unrealistic to think that we could be. I believe, in light of the deficit which the coalition has inherited from the previous government, we have to be very cautious in terms of what the expectations will be for the Northern Territory. I remind honourable members of the arguments for the Northern Territory to be considered for special funding needs, especially in areas of health, education, housing and roads in smaller remote communities. Land rights and native title have an impact on development, as does the duplication of services by the Commonwealth in the provision of state&amp;hyphen;like functions.

        The economic factors cover many sectors—uranium, gold, bauxite, manganese, copper, natural gas, zinc, Timor Gap oil and other products, which represented $1.49 billion worth of exports from the Northern Territory in 1994&amp;hyphen;95. With tourism, in the early 1970s our figures were 50,000 tourists a year. In 1994&amp;hyphen;95 over one million tourists visited the Northern Territory. Present investment in tourism ventures and infrastructure is over $200 million and the estimate of revenue from tourism in the Northern Territory is $645 million for 1994&amp;hyphen;95.

        The territory has been at the forefront in developing trade links with Asia over many years.

        Concerning primary industry and live cattle exports, the honourable member for Herbert (Mr Lindsay), in his maiden speech, spoke about the live exports that were evolving from the Townsville region. When the Northern Territory started its live cattle export program some 10 years ago, southern producers thought that they were not on the right boat, but in 1996 we can assume that about 300,000 head of cattle will be exported through the port of Darwin and the indications for 1996&amp;hyphen;97 are that, hopefully, as many as half a million head of cattle could be exported through the Darwin port.

        Horticulture and aquaculture industries are expanding all the time. I understand that in the pearling industry, which is one of the major fishing industries that we have, exports are totalling in excess of $100 million a year. Defence spending was about $54 million per annum in the territory last year. Obviously, defence has become a very important part of the economic factors in the Northern Territory and all indications are that the coalition is going to maintain the current defence infrastructure and spending in its budget. As I said earlier in the address&amp;hyphen;in&amp;hyphen;reply debate, one per cent of the population of Australia produces exports to two per cent of the GDP.
