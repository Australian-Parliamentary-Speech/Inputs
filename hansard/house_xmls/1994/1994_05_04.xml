         —I am not happy to be speaking on this child sex tourism legislation. It is a moment of shame for our nation that we need this kind of legislation. We have all known for years that the child prostitution racket is very widespread in Asia and that it exists in Australia. This legislation is long overdue and I will be pleased to vote for it. My view is a basic, common one: sex is an activity for adults. The coercion of children in this world—coercion by drugs, force, or poverty—is against all the mainstream values that Australians hold as sacred. It is fitting that this parliament should respond to the rising tide of objections from our Asian neighbours and use an Australian law to try to curb the gross behaviour of some Australians in Asia.

         Whilst I support this legislation, I am not especially confident that it will be effective on a day-to-day basis. We should not be discouraged by this. We need the law as a backstop. Australians should always know that this law exists and that it will be used. Whilst it may not be perfectly effective, an offending Australian will never be sure whether or not it will suddenly be effective towards him. This fear is a good thing and hopefully will give some benefit to abused children in Asia.

         Of course, Australians are not the only offenders. Many of these children are literally sold for cash money by their parents to brothel keepers in the cities. I know that cultural differences exist between Australia and other places, and we must be sensitive to these cultural differences. However, there must be a limit to how far an act can be described as culturally different before it becomes anti-human. I suggest that selling one's children into prostitution is anti-human.

         That Australians would exploit this tragedy does great damage to our international standing. We are very quick to sit in judgment on the moral failings of others. It is therefore appropriate that we should give legislative backing to our professed high moral standards. In recent years, the United Nations has taken an ever greater involvement in the question of children's rights. This is to be encouraged. I have served on the national board of UNICEF Australia for the past seven years, and I applaud the work that it has done in regard to the protection of children.

         I note that the legal basis for this legislation arises out of the external powers provision of the current Australian constitution. The opposition in recent weeks has been attacking these powers in relation to the Tasmania case, yet soon it will vote in support of this bill, thus agreeing to the use of the external powers provision and the UN declarations. Australia would be well served if the opposition could get its act together and decide whether it approves or disapproves of the external powers provision and then act consistently.

         The main provisions of this amendment are quite complicated. As gaol terms of 17 to 14 years are very serious, we need to look carefully at the amendment. The offences being legislated against fall into two categories: those involving children under 12 years of age and those involving minors between 12 and 16 years. In Australian law, absolute precision surrounds these ages. We can achieve such precision because we have birth certificates which are kept accurately and which are available as a public documents. This is not the case to the same degree in Asia. In Australia, to provide a birth certificate that shows that a minor turned 16 the day before the charged offence would see the charge collapse. This level of precision does not operate in Asia. Where a sentence of 14 years is pending, it is a very serious problem. Section 50FA of the amendment bill gives a jury the right to estimate the age of a child where the court is satisfied that there is insufficient evidence to establish the matter otherwise. I think that this section should require a jury to hear an opinion from the court appointed doctor and take that opinion into consideration when deciding on this vital issue of the age of the child in question.

         The defences that can be brought forward by defendants are basically two: the defendant believed that the child was aged 16 years or older, and the defendant believed that the child consented to the relevant sexual conduct. These defences are reasonable and in line with Australian practice. Indeed it is difficult to see what defences other than these could be allowed. Again I would stress the problem of determining age and consent.

         A great deal of the child sex business in Asia, as in Australia, is big business and big money. In those circumstances the question of consent becomes very difficult. A way out of this problem may be to simply turn the whole prosecution on determining the age of the child and declaring a child under 16 legally incapable of consenting to any sexual relations outside a valid marriage with any Australian. I note that this bill does not take this option.

         The idea of taking evidence by video link from outside Australia is fraught with peril. What is to stop the substitution of a younger child for the actual child who had sexual relations with the Australian defendant? What is to prevent a blackmail attempt by interested parties outside Australia? Perhaps, as Australian embassies are actually Australian territory, it would be better to convene a Federal Court in an Australian embassy on any occasion when this legislation is the basis for a prosecution.

         I notice that the age of 16 years is used as an age of consent for both males and females outside Australia. This is not the case within Australia. I can see a legal challenge to state age of consent laws when this legislation is passed. Perhaps the Attorney-General (Mr Lavarch) should attempt to obtain a uniform age across Australia for both males and females. What the age is is the question for negotiation. What is essential is that the age be uniform and applicable to all Australians, male and female, in or out of Australia. It would be most unwise to have convictions overturned on appeal due to conflict within laws. These matters should be ironed out before the laws are used to deal with this problem.

         This legislation should become the law of Australia. This parliament should say to Australians that our public norms apply to them no matter where they go. We have a duty to maintain our international reputation. I am fully confident that we are doing the right thing in passing this legislation. It may not always be able to be used but its existence will add a note of fear into the degenerate Australians who molest children in Asia. This fear is a good thing. I am pleased to vote for this bill, and in doing so give some hope and encouragement to those in Asia fighting the good fight on behalf of Asian children.

         —We are debating the Crimes (Child Sex Tourism) Amendment Bill because of the concerns of Western countries over the sexual exploitation and abuse by Western nationals of children overseas and in Asian countries in particular. Similar legislation has already been introduced in several European jurisdictions, including Germany, Sweden and Norway. Our obligations to take action are further highlighted as Australia is a party to the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, which was ratified by Australia on 17 December 1990 and came into force in Australia on 16 January 1991.

It is also important that I support the views expressed by my learned colleague the honourable member for Tangney (Mr Williams) in calling for this bill to be referred to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs. Closer scrutiny now will result in better legislation to enforce the law against these ugly Australians who abuse children in other countries. We need to ensure that when this legislation becomes law it will impose a standard of behaviour on Australians visiting other countries in relation to sexual contact involving children.

         In considering the legal arguments we also should be prepared to look at the same picture as the international community sees when it examines child prostitution in countries like Thailand. We cannot legitimately argue that the problem of child prostitution in Asia is not ours or that the Australian legislation can have no meaningful impact on the situation and, therefore, is futile and pointless. I accept that the primary cause of child prostitution in Asia stems from the problems in the countries in which it exists. Children in Asia become prostitutes because of their poverty. The impoverished guardians of these children may be tricked, but are more usually forced, into delivering them into prostitution. Alternatively, street children become prostitutes by an act of free will. However, I use the term `free will' advisedly since the options available to street kids are probably limited to destitution or prostitution.

         Australians are not solely responsible for the demand which the impoverished of the Philippines and Thailand in particular are driven to supply. In the bars and on the streets where paedophiles go to buy young children, there can be found a mix of nationalities. Child prostitution in Asia exists to satisfy not only Australians but also Americans, Europeans and other Asians. These are factors which limit the impact we can have on the problem in its entirety but should not deter us from action.

         Looking at it from a different perspective, perhaps we cannot afford to leave it to other governments to punish those in our community who are creating the demand that is the lifeblood of the child sex industry. The government in Thailand has pledged to end child prostitution but the police seem to have made few inroads. By its very nature prostitution among street kids defies policing, yet even when prostitution is organised through established institutions police have had little permanent impact. It has been suggested that many police are closely bound up with prostitution through bodies and part ownership of establishments that profit from the sex trade.

         Perhaps the reluctance of the Thai police to pursue child sex customers and profiteers may also be attributed to the ease with which such offenders once arrested can secure their freedom. While Thai offenders can escape a gaol sentence through the payment of a small fee, foreigners can simply call in their embassy and seek deportation. Amongst the customers and the profiteers there is the belief that the sexual exploitation of Asian children carries immunity from the law. At present this belief does not seem entirely unwarranted.

         Both principal and practical realities demand that Australia develop the legislation that will make it a criminal offence for Australians to engage in sexual relations with children overseas or to organise or promote child sex tourism. By ratifying the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child, we have committed ourselves to the principle of protecting children from exploitation.

         Thanks to the bravado of those involved, perhaps one of the worst kept secrets in this country is that many Australians travel to Asian countries for the primary purpose of buying sex. Although there are approximately 300,000 Australians visiting Asia each year, it is estimated that only about 200 of these are undertaking sex tours. The media coverage of Australia's paedophiles in Asia has been extensive and damaging, blasting any comfortable perception we may have had of loud but generous Aussies in Asia for a bit of harmless fun. The participation of Australians in the Asian child prostitution industry is anything but harmless; it is destructive, and even when it leaves no physical scars it is no more than an act of violence.

        There are other stories of elderly and middle-aged Australian men procuring boys as young as 13. It is claimed by Mr Robinson that the Victoria Police and Australian Federal Police have closely monitored the activities of travel agencies and more than 15 known paedophiles after the detection of several organised sex tours to Asia. The Victoria Police have successfully infiltrated one travel agency owned by two men whose home is in the northern suburbs of Melbourne. The targeting of travel agencies follows revelations by Philippines authorities that they have banned at least 10 Australians for allegedly molesting Filipino boys.

         Mr Robinson further claims that an unpublished Victoria Police report on child prostitution in Asia completed about two years ago, which was a joint police-customs operation, has already uncovered a number of prominent Australian male offenders involved in an international boys association. They were travelling to both Thailand and the Philippines for sexual liaisons with boys of the same age who would normally be committed to their care in their organisation.

         The demand for prostitutes grows daily as sex tourists to Asia increasingly want sex with children rather than adults, whom they may previously have targeted. This shift of preference is widely attributed to the misguided perception amongst sex consumers that the young are AIDS free, which is surely a rather twisted implementation of the safe sex principle.

         The exact number of child prostitutes in Asia is not accurately known, but it is conservatively estimated to be about 200,000. Some argue that it could be 800,000. The prevalence of AIDS amongst young child prostitutes in Asia is extremely high. One organisation which rehabilitates child prostitutes has found that 40 per cent of the children it rescues are HIV positive. Other authorities put this figure at 50 per cent. On the one hand, it is tragic that the lives of these children will be cut short by AIDS. On the other, our population is put at greater risk when Australian paedophiles, sometimes family men who are nearly always sexually active when in Australia, engage in sex with AIDS infected children overseas.

         The bill before the House raises interesting issues of morality and culture in the very large worldwide industry of prostitution, be it male or female prostitution or adult or child prostitution. It raises questions as to why, for example, when the industry thrives everywhere in the world, countries are still refusing to regulate it. It is a nonsense to suggest that we are going to control the sex industry anywhere in the world by this legislation, by pretending that the industry does not exist or that it can be, in health terms, controlled by keeping it an illegal activity. Prostitution in Thailand is illegal; prostitution with children in Thailand is illegal; and prostitution in Australia is still largely illegal.

I support fully the comments of the previous speaker, the honourable member for Adelaide (Ms Worth), that health is surely now one of the major concerns about this industry. If we are going to have an effect on that industry, it can only be achieved by recognising this point and imposing some regulatory control over the industry so that those engaged in it, be they adults or children, get health coverage and are taught to use hygienic methods that reduce the health problems associated with their activities. I for one call on all Asian governments, not just the Thailand government, and Australian states to recognise that very simple fact.

         I guess that, as a normal, healthy male, having travelled widely through Asia over a number of years, I have been more than aware of the nature of the sex industry. It really is grotesque to think that young boys and young girls, particularly from the northern parts of Thailand and Burma, are purchased as slaves. We really are talking about a white slave trade. They are taken away from the area which they know. Usually they are quite illiterate and uneducated. They are not even used to the ways of larger cities like Chiang Mai, let alone the megalopolis that is now Bangkok. They are taken to a place where they are sold, primarily to westerners, as virgins for quite enormous sums of money.

I do not think that, until there is a will in the countries concerned to take their own actions to regulate their industries and to impose their own controls upon them, this legislation will reduce the sex industry or the availability of young boys and girls for western tourists in those countries.

There are more people addicted to serepax, rohypnol and valium than there are to heroin. We need to look at that problem rather than to waste a lot of money trying to control the heroin trade.

         As a traditionally trained English common lawyer, I do have some concern about the nature of the extraterritoriality of the legislation. We are here in Australia saying that an act committed in another territory over which we do not have jurisdiction will be a criminal offence for the purposes of Australian law if committed by an Australian resident or an Australian citizen. That is an extension at common law of the jurisdictional rights of Australian courts. It is a very fundamental and very wide extension. It also raises very big questions about the nature of the evidence which will be required to successfully prosecute such a case in Australia.

         Quite properly, we are not going to change the evidentiary burden which would be placed upon any prosecution. Hence, in order to be successful in a prosecution, the prosecutor would first need to establish the age of the victim. That would be the first and the fundamental evidentiary burden placed on the prosecution. Are we then going to pay to bring people from Thailand to Australia to give evidence, or are we going to establish other means whereby the evidence can be taken in Thailand, subject to Australian evidentiary burdens of proof, and then accepted in an Australian court?

         Questions arise of whether or not the victims would be willing to be part of such a prosecution process and, if they were willing, whether their lives would be put at further risk. Let us make no mistake about this. Organised criminality does not hold human life very dearly. The people who are involved in organised criminal activities and who use child prostitutes in an Asian country are not going to take very lightly attempts to bring them to justice by using the children as witnesses. So in some senses, understanding the way these things operate, I have some concerns that if we are indeed going to try to use young children from other countries as witnesses in an Australian prosecution we may be placing them at some degree of risk. In that sense, I believe this country is going to need to provide adequate financial assistance to enable the children to structure a life away from criminality and to ensure that their lives are protected in the country where they want to live.

         —At the outset, I would like to say that I am in strong support of the intent of the Crimes (Child Sex Tourism) Amendment Bill and certainly in general support of the wording of the bill. In saying that, I recognise there are many technical difficulties associated with the bill, particularly in gathering evidence in other countries and in prosecuting people for acts that are perpetrated overseas. It is estimated that something like five million tourists worldwide visit Asia each year. Something like 300,000 of those come from Australia and, of that number, something like several hundred to several thousand visit centres like Bangkok and Manila to have sex with children, something that the great mass of people in this country do not find acceptable.

         These people partake in acts that, if they were perpetrated in Australia, would lead to prosecution and gaol here. I think these acts on child prostitutes overseas are despicable. They are condemned by something in excess of 99 per cent of the people who live in this country and contribute to harming these children overseas, both mentally and physically. I will have something more to say about that later. The Australians who do this damage our reputation overseas, and the term `ugly Australian' which grew out of the 1950s is now taking on a new and more sinister meaning.

         There have been reports that Australians have owned up to one-third of the brothels in the red-light district in Manila at one stage or another. Ron O'Grady—a New Zealander who is the director of ECPAT, End Child Prostitution in Asian Tourism, which is a non-government agency working in 25 countries—has said that many brothels there have Australian themes. You only have to walk down a street in the Manila district of Ermita to see that every second bar is The Happy Kangaroo, The Jolly Swagman or The Drunken Wombat. Mr O'Grady says that among the worst offenders in these areas are Australian tourists. That is something that this country certainly cannot be proud of.

         A number of countries overseas have already introduced legislation or taken measures to ban their citizens from engaging in child prostitution in Asian countries. Amongst these are Germany, France, Norway, Sweden and other Scandinavian countries. Of the five million tourists from countries around the world who visit Asian countries each year, the worst offenders engaging in child prostitution come from Australia, Germany, the United States, Japan and Britain. Some travel agents openly organise sex tours to these countries. Though, unlike the honourable member for McEwen (Mr Cleeland), I have never been to any of these particular Asian countries myself, I am told that just to sit in a plane going from Australia to, say, Bangkok and witness the lurid behaviour and expectations of the travellers on that plane, especially amongst those in the 50- to 60-year-old age bracket, can make one ashamed to be an Australian citizen.

         The reasons why children engage in prostitution are many and complex. They are usually a combination of many things, not the least of which is poverty. Parents often deliberately put their children into these positions or, in some cases, are actually tricked into putting their children in these situations. The parents may be told that the children will be paid big money to act as models or to wash dishes or whatever and find out later that the children end up being child prostitutes. Once trapped in this profession, it is very hard for the children to get out of it until they become too old or clapped out at what we would still consider the tender age of perhaps 20 or 25. Once in this profession, the children are exposed to many detrimental things, not the least of which are things detrimental to their health profile. Something like a quarter to half of the child prostitutes in some countries are HIV positive. As tourists wanting to avoid getting AIDS demand younger and younger children, so the pressure on younger children to become prostitutes escalates.

         There is also a physical danger to these children. The anal and vaginal tissues of young children tear much more easily than those of adults, and this makes them more prone to infection. In many cases, paediatricians have to sew them up. There have been many horrific cases. One highlighted recently was a case of a 10-year-old Filipina who died after being vaginally abused by a 33-year-old Austrian or German doctor who, after finishing doing what he wanted to do with her with his own body, put an electrical vibrator into her which broke and caused her to bleed. He left her and she ended up dying.

         The doctor was charged, but I believe he was released afterwards on a number of technicalities, not the least of which was a dispute over her age.

         There are also mental dangers to these children. They feel betrayed by the adults who manipulate them, and in some cases it is their parents. They are exploited by the pimps who take virtually all the money earned by the children who engage in these sexual acts. These pimps force more and more customers on the children. They charge these young girls and boys, in some cases, for food and board. Often these charges end up being more than what the children are being paid for the work that they do; therefore, they are in perpetual debt.

         Asian countries are starting to crack down more on child prostitution, which is a trend I think we would all welcome. When adults who engage in these crimes are caught, there is often a reluctance in these Asian countries to commit money, scarce resources and time to prosecute these people fully. If people are alerted that they may be charged or if people are charged and then let out on bail, they usually end up fleeing the country, and I am sad to say that that is often in compliance with the embassies in those countries.

         Nit, a peasant girl from the north, was sold for the price of a television. In the Bangkok shelter where we met, she sat politely on the edge of a sofa, fidgeting with her hair. At 13, she still looked small and guileless enough to play with dolls. And she talked only in whispers. Five months ago, an agent paid her father 8,000 baht (about $320). The agent, a soldier, told her she would wash dishes; instead he took her to a house with 15 other girls.

She says they bury their feelings and hide their experiences even when they visit the doctor, sore with venereal diseases. Some girls so effectively block out the past that they forget their home address or even their parents' names. Sister Michele says she is only just learning how troubled the children are, how much attention they need. "We have to talk things out very, very slowly," she says.

Once this legislation is passed, I believe we will stop the majority of Australians from engaging in this type of activity. That in itself makes it very worth while.

This legislation seems to cover every angle—not just engaging in sexual activity. If a child is induced to commit, submit to or participate in, or be present while a third person commits acts of indecency in the presence of the person but they are not committed by or on him or her, 10 years imprisonment applies in the case of children under 16 years old and 12 years imprisonment in the case of children under 12 years old.

I am pleased to see that the Minister for Justice (Mr Kerr) has agreed to that, and an advisory report will come back from that committee by 30 May 1994.

         People in my electorate might wonder why the Australian parliament should involve itself in drafting new laws to protect children from a neighbouring country from sexual abuse. Why can these countries and why will these countries not ensure that sexual exploitation of their children is stopped? A visit to these countries would show that many of them are trying to curb this awful trade in children, but they are faced with many other daunting political, social and economic problems which tend to dominate their governments' thinking, planning and strategies. These countries are welcoming Australia's involvement in curbing the sexual exploitation of young children in countries to our north.

Far too many Australians salve their consciences in the yearly gift to overseas aid organisations and then forget to press their elected representatives to address problems such as this. Child exploitation is a problem which many of us find too difficult to discuss. We need to address in a very real sense the lot of children in overseas countries. As I said before, I commend the minister for taking on the issue of child exploitation as I believe that will encourage Australians to discuss the issue rather than neatly tuck it away out of sight and out of mind, creating a further advantage to those sick and twisted people already exploiting children for sexual pleasure.

         I remember an attempt in the 1980s to discuss the issue of child exploitation in Australia. Unfortunately, the discussion of this important issue was initiated by an organised paedophile group. This group justified the act of sex between adults and children, using the spurious argument that children are capable of making up their own minds about whether or not they want to have sex and that other adults have been impairing these children's rights. What a spurious argument that was—one which was totally rejected by the Australian community. Of course, children do have rights in this country but they are also protected from adults whose experience and cunning may be used to take advantage of the natural naivety of young children.

         I support this bill wholeheartedly. I am genuinely disgusted with abuse of children, all children around the world, regardless of the form that abuse takes. I am particularly incensed that some adults use their power to exploit our children. This bill will impose substantial penalties, ranging from 10 to 17 years imprisonment or, correspondingly, high pecuniary penalties if a company is involved. I suppose, personally, I would go a lot further than that. But we must at least have a beginning. Important too is that the defendant's rights to fair and proper hearings are ensured, given the difficulties in using overseas evidence and, of course, child witnesses.

         But I reiterate here in this House: protecting children is of paramount importance. The appalling stories of sexual abuse of our children are many and varied. I know that many honourable members, in speaking to this bill, have brought up examples. Of course, various media reports have attributed the gravitation to children for sex to the fact that adults fear the catching of AIDS. Presumably, these exploiters do not feel concerned about transmitting AIDS to our young people or perhaps naively they believe that children are immune from catching or transmitting AIDS.

         I know that recently in one country it was estimated that 1,000 young boys and girls are now selling their bodies. In the case of those boys and girls, it is to feed themselves. That is a significant increase in recent years—and the country to which I refer is not an Asian country. According to another recent report about sex tours, men questioned about involvement believe that they are contributing to the country's economy by visiting and exploiting young girls in that particular country. With that kind of attitude, obviously today's legislation is more than timely.

         That report, which I read also, stated that sex tours now have become part of accepted and entrenched business practices. It has been mentioned already by the previous speaker, the honourable member for Franklin (Mr Quick), that some corporations are now using sex, just like alcohol, to service their clients and to socialise with their colleagues. Young impoverished girls come from vast squatter areas offering sex services to business and other foreign tourists. It is critical and crucial that countries like Australia—I understand that Germany is also introducing similar legislation—persist in stamping out these abhorrent practices of exploiting young children. If we are blase and continue to be complacent, then any action or publicity about the subject will just dissipate.

         For instance, in January of 1990 the arrest and subsequent conviction in Bangkok of a well-known American paedophile on charges of molesting teenage boys made local headlines for a whole two weeks. Angry letters appeared in Thai language newspapers expressing shock and disgust about the incident and the condemnation of paedophiles, but after the initial outrage the story just died down and became just another item to be filed away and forgotten by all. Despite media reports that scores of other foreign paedophiles are arrested in Thailand, many people do not realise that Thailand now is the major destination for international paedophile tour groups.

How disgusting to think it is young children that these people are hunting. According to ECPAT, paedophiles set up regular sex tours in which children, some as young as eight and nine, are used to satisfy customers. ECPAT has also stated that paedophile groups are the base of a highly profitable international market for child pornography produced in various Asian countries.

         Reading various publications and articles on child prostitution truly is a revelation. Reports are common of westerners regularly visiting Asian countries where `they have a warehouse full of young boys and you can do whatever you want with them.' Tourists actually purchase a slave for their own use. For a few hours that slave can be required to do whatever the tourist-master desires and that child ceases to have any rights whatsoever in that relationship. The power imbalances and exploitation are obvious.

         Aligned with sex exploitation is the highly exploitative practice of child pornography. On a worldwide scale child pornography is already a lucrative business and the demand for it is increasing. Unfortunately, in many Asian countries it is easy to exploit the poor and to buy children because the laws of their countries do not provide adequate protection for them.

         Child abuse is a multidimensional problem. It is caused by many factors impacting on families across a wide variety of our social structures. Alarmingly, statistical information on the subject of the abuse of children even within this country has stated that there were some 49,721 cases of child abuse and neglect reported to our welfare departments between 1 July 1990 and 30 June 1991. That is only one year. Child abuse or neglect was substantiated in 45 per cent of the 46,769 cases finalised in that financial year. This is here within Australia and does not take into account what is happening overseas. Even within our own country, in 64 per cent of substantiated cases of abuse of children, a parent or guardian was identified as responsible either for the abuse or neglect of that child.

We hope through that strategy to raise the awareness of the nature and extent of child abuse and encourage adults to relate to children in a positive way. We hope to teach parents, service workers and children about child abuse prevention skills. We need to encourage other programs to take account of children and to develop efforts which contribute to preventing child abuse.

What we are essentially talking about is one of the most vile forms of colonial exploitation.

        Tourism is the selling of dreams. It gives ordinary middle class people from Western nations the chance to live like royalty.

        The meaning is clear. The tourist is purchasing a slave for his own use. For a few hours the slave can be required to do whatever the tourist master desires and the child ceases to have any rights in the relationship. This form of modern slavery naturally opens the door to all forms of sadism. I think this is one of the worst forms of exploitation of foreign children in that because of ignorance and racism it allows an absolute abuse of power, which these people know is not tolerated in their own country.

One of the girls had been bought from her parents for $200.

        This sort of shocking abuse is happening all over South-East Asia. It will do nothing to forward the economic future of those countries or our reputation if Australian nationals are, as they are—and it is well known—taking part. I quote further from the material:

        There are villages in north east Thailand where it is hard to find any children at all. Parents in some cases are selling their children from the earliest years.

        This is not an indictment on this particular woman; it is an indictment on the alarming poverty in these countries which leads to such situations. I refer back to the speech of my colleague the honourable member for McEwen (Mr Cleeland) on the involvement of Thai culture in this tourism. O'Grady suggests that widespread prostitution really developed as a consequence of the Vietnam War. O'Grady says that by the end of the Vietnam War in 1975 the sex industry had become firmly established. But the end of the war also raised questions about the future of several million people whose livelihood had been built around the inflow of American war dollars.

         Two things started to emerge at this time. The first was the growth of a large indigenous sex trade. Thai men who had not been particularly avid customers of brothels in earlier history suddenly began to cultivate a new lifestyle. Tens of thousands of out of work prostitutes became available to Thai men, even in the poorer suburbs. Older and handicapped prostitutes began to sell their bodies for as little as a few cents. Now it has been claimed that 450,000 Thai men visit a prostitute every day. So it would appear that this is a relatively new historical phenomenon in Thailand and the result of a very unfortunate episode in Western history in Asia; one of the side effects of one of the last colonial exploitations in South East Asia, the Vietnam War.

         With the recent visit of the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to Asia and the opening of the new friendship bridge we have a very important opportunity to gain a significant reputation as a friend to our Asian neighbours. This legislation sends another clear signal into Asia that we respect Asian people, that we regard them as our friends and that we will not tolerate our nationals exploiting Asian people, who are going to be our friends and colleagues in the future.

         —I rise to support the Crimes (Child Sex Tourism) Amendment Bill 1994. The amendments to the Crimes Act clarify the government's position, which is to ensure that Australian citizens and residents who sexually exploit children overseas will face prosecution under Commonwealth law if apprehended in Australia. It will also be illegal for members of the tourist industry to help those exploiters achieve their sick objectives. It appears that although Australia ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child in 1990 to fulfil Australia's domestic obligations, now there is a need to respond to the appalling behaviour of some Australians overseas.

         Studies have shown that Australian tourists have been identified as significant sexual abusers of children overseas, particularly in Asia. In the Third World there are an estimated 800,000 underage prostitutes in Thailand; 400,000 in India; 250,000 in Brazil; and 60,000 in the Philippines. The newest areas to become involved are Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos and China.

         While in the Philippines last year the Australian ambassador spoke of the `ugly Australians', as he called them. He told me how they arrived in Manila with the sole purpose of exploiting young women and children of the area. Sometimes it was in the disguise of taking a wife, but when the same person has been back three or four times it is hard to feel anything but disgust and shame for our fellow Australians.

         Prostitution is an age-old profession and provided there are strict rules to ensure the safety, health and dignity of the women involved there is little that can be done to prohibit the activity in some countries. It may be the only way uneducated women can find some form of employment to feed their families. However, when it comes to selling children from poor families into slavery and these kids then become objects for sale to tourists, it becomes sick and alarming. It is hard to imagine that we have ordinary Australians from all sorts of backgrounds setting off to buy child sex from agencies in such countries as Thailand, the Philippines and other parts of Asia. So much for our image as a clean, green country, as reliable business partners or as a socially just society. This shows our other side as Western dominators, our suspected superiority over other cultures, our racism that lurks beneath our benign exteriors. We are really kidding ourselves.

         I am sad to think that this legislation is needed in Australia, but I know that it is from hearing from our ambassadors and trade people oversees, from reading the exposes in various magazines and newspapers. We are no better than the Japanese, western Europeans or the Americans when it comes to child prostitution. People both in this country and overseas are making a fortune out of it, leaving the youngsters involved with little or no money, sick and dying, and slaves to their own poverty. Once the young are in the business there is little or no way out, except in a coffin.

         Similar laws to this one, I understand, are being considered in Germany and may have only a limited effect, but they are important from a moral point of view and say something about us as a country. This law will mean we are taking responsibility for our own citizens' behaviour overseas. It will act as some sort of deterrent and will be the first step towards solving the problem of people targeting children in less developed countries.

         But we need to do more. We need to assist these countries to provide better working conditions for their people, better pay and training, better health and education so they can break away from having to sell their children to survive. Ron O'Grady, international coordinator for a Bangkok based campaign to end child prostitution—my colleague the honourable member for Capricornia (Ms Henzell) quoted him on several occasions in her speech—seems to have a lot of information and seems to be one of the leaders in this area of understanding the situation. He stated in an article:

        Incidents are becoming increasingly prevalent in Asia but only in certain selected countries. Tourists are obviously careful about the places they visit for sexual purposes and their choice has been governed to a large extent by the reputation of the country for tolerance in sexual matters. Poor countries have an obvious attraction for paedophiles from affluent countries.

         Children and their parents are more desperate for money and are therefore easy targets for procurers. The government has greater priorities than the fate of a few thousand street children and police will often turn a blind eye to events in exchange for a supplement to their meagre wages.

        Hence one of the major problems that I saw in Asia: lowly paid and poorly trained police forces. While there is a market and the police are part of the pay-off, there will be no great change. Everything becomes a commodity, even the human beings. This situation has to change and these amendments to the crimes law are only one way that Australia can take responsibility for its own citizens. I hope Germany goes down the same path and that all other countries who are known to have tourists seeking this sort of gratification also seek to change their laws to give the same recognition as we have.

It requires external territories to which the universal service obligation does not extend to be prescribed. The universal service obligation provides that access to and supply of the standard telephone service and payphones must be provided throughout Australia. Currently the obligation specifically does not apply in the external territories to which the act extends. The amendment will ensure that the universal obligation applies to the Indian Ocean territories.

         This is an issue that I have had a long and genuine interest in over the five years that I have been looking after this portfolio on behalf of the federal coalition. It brings me a great deal of pleasure to see the parliament of Australia, the government of this country, moving in the direction that we are moving in, and have been for some time now—that is, to try to tidy up a number of important issues relating to our maritime industries. These are issues that relate to the safety of ships at sea and to the protection of our marine environment. All of them are terribly important to Australia, our being a major maritime trading nation.

         I think we have the fifth largest maritime task in the world. Of course, we have one of the largest coastlines in the world, and that needs to be protected. In particular, we have some of the most famous parts of the world's coastline around the Great Barrier Reef. All of them are very important tourist income earners for Australia, and they need proper protection. This bill adds to those bills that have preceded it in this House over the last year or two. It further protects the Australian maritime environment, our coastline, and tightens up some areas of ship safety.

         I now turn to the aspects of the bill that relate to my portfolio. The first is the Navigation Act 1912. There are some minor amendments tidying up the act. The industry regards these as sensible, and so do we. The second aspect of the bill that is pertinent to me involves the Occupational Health and Safety (Maritime Industry) Act 1993. There is a minor amendment enabling the Governor-General to make some regulations. As has often been the case in recent times, it raises the question of why it was omitted from the original act, which was passed through this parliament just last year. We so often see legislation introduced into the House and within a matter of months or a year or so it is brought back for some tidying up. Whilst we cannot get everything right all the time, it does raise the fact that we need to be more careful in the drawing up of these bills to ensure that we do not have to take up the time of the parliament, which is at a considerable cost to the taxpayer of Australia, in overcoming minor amendments like this which reflect shortfalls in the drafting of legislation.

         The third aspect involves the Protection of the Sea (Civil Liability) Act 1981. This provides for recovery of loss, damages, costs or expenses incurred by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority in the combat of pollution. The Australian Maritime Safety Authority is the body that looks after all of Australia's maritime regulations. It looks after navigation equipment, navigation aids and all those things that are important to the maritime industry in Australia. It operates through a cost recovery process. Whatever costs it incurs on behalf of the government, the government has to pay for. It runs like a normal business, but it has a very important task. In light of that, this amendment will now enable it to recover any costs or damages incurred by it through its role of combating pollution at sea. This is very important because any pollution caused at sea can run into very large dollars.

         As people will remember, probably the most spectacular pollution at sea incident in Australia in recent years was the break-up of the ship

The cost of cleaning that up and rescuing the crew and all those other things can be and should be recovered. This legislation ensures that is so. It can run into tens of millions of dollars and in some instances even hundreds of millions of dollars. Probably the most spectacular internationally known oil pollution incident occurred with the
         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">

         The Australian Chamber of Shipping, which primarily represents foreign flag vessels, was concerned that AMSA's right of recovery would be limited to recovery from parties proven responsible for a pollution breach under legislation and that this would obviate the need to draw on funding through the oil pollution levy. It was concerned to know whether this was the case. In fact, it is the case.

         Not so long ago, this parliament, supported again by the opposition, passed legislation enabling Australia to contribute to the international compensation fund. Funds are paid into this international fund by all ship operators around the world. If there is a major oil spill or some form of pollution at sea, the cost of cleaning it up can be recovered from that fund. What we are doing here enables us to bypass calling on the international compensation fund and go directly to the person who it is proven is responsible for the cause of that pollution and charge him or her for the cost of it. This means that the cost of cleaning up pollution at sea can be focused right back onto the people responsible rather than being a burden on the international shipping community at large.

         The fourth aspect relevant to my responsibilities is the Protection of the Sea (Prevention of Pollution from Ships) Act 1983. This provides for the detention of foreign flag vessels suspected of violations within Australian territorial waters.

          Some representations from the Australian Chamber of Shipping expressed concerned about some aspects of this. We referred the matter to a Senate committee. Our colleagues in the other place established a committee to look into this particular concern, and the Australian Chamber of Shipping representatives had a chance to outline their case there. It was properly heard and the committee made its judgment. But the chamber felt that the legislation unfairly discriminates against foreign flag vessels by preventing them from sailing whilst Australian flag vessels are free to trade on. The Chamber of Shipping made it clear that it did not seek to protect disreputable shipping operators but, rather, to ensure that the powers in the legislation were not used to detain foreign flag vessels while investigations were carried out to determine the cause of a pollution incident.

         It is worth noting that, whilst foreign flag vessels—if they are suspected of causing pollution in Australian waters—could be detained at port whilst tests are carried out to see who is actually responsible for the cause of pollution, Australian flag vessels are not detained. There is a good reason for this: Australian flag vessels technically never leave Australian jurisdiction, whereas a foreign flag vessel within a couple of hours steaming time of a port can leave Australian jurisdiction and never return. Hence, if it is responsible for that pollution, we have no opportunity to recover the costs incurred in cleaning it up or to penalise those people for causing that pollution in the first place. Whilst it does seem on the surface to be unfair to foreign flag vessels, on balance, when one considers that Australian flag vessels never leave Australian jurisdiction whereas foreign flag vessels can, then we would consider this aspect of the legislation to be reasonable.

         The Australian National Maritime Association, which is the body that represents Australian flag vessel owners and operators, pointed out that Australian flag vessels are already subject to stringent legislation domestically, and this legislation makes foreign flag vessels similarly liable. In the view of the Australian flag operators, this legislation puts Australian flag ships and foreign flag vessels on an even footing. ANMA argues that no responsible shipper would object to measures to protect waters from ships poorly maintained and staffed, and that is a view that I have confirmed from my own experience. Most Australian shippers are aware of the down sides of bad publicity if some pollution occurs at sea, and they generally act very responsibly. It is not the case with every single shipper, but I think it is fair to say it is the case in general. The Chamber of Shipping agreed with that sentiment. Its concern was that undue delay not be imposed, and it wanted to ensure that any delays to the movement of member ships were avoided and to remove any inequity.

         It is worth noting that the legislation being brought into the House today is in line with provisions of the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea. About 80 countries around the world adhere to this particular law making Australian vessels subject to the same provisions and the same supposed inequities in non-Australian ports. So, on balance, my colleagues in the opposition and I think that this is a fair amendment to the legislation and that it is the only way to maintain jurisdiction, since none applies to a non-port state flag vessel once it has left the jurisdiction of a port state.

         The Senate committee shared ACOS's concerns that unnecessary delay should not result.

I think the Senate committee probably reflected the general view in the community.

         The committee said that AMSA will have to put in place a very efficient system for the collection and analysis of samples. In the case of vessels that have departed port, this could mean intercepting ships to obtain samples. The committee also said that AMSA must streamline the system of securing financial responsibility through P&amp;I clubs and that it should be possible to arrange for samples to be obtained without having vessels return to port. Interestingly enough, the AMSA witnesses at the committee confirmed that return to port would be required only in an extreme case. The committee observed that this should be the case even where a number of ships are being investigated for a breach, even if they are still in port. So delay need not occur and, indeed, in most cases should not occur.

         The committee found that there was no basic inequality in the provisions of the legislation. The committee did, however, say it would watch the progress of investigations under the legislation and would respond to any industry representations that are made about unusual or lengthy delays resulting in ships being detained. So it is a matter of saying, `Let's try it and see how it is works and, if unreasonable delays are being incurred by foreign flag vessels, perhaps that will be a chance to look at it again.' But, given the assurance that AMSA has offered us, we are satisfied at this stage to let AMSA prove that it will detain vessels only in extreme circumstances. If that is the case, then we will be very happy with that.

         This bill is a piece of legislation which we think, on balance, is worth while and, therefore, we will be supporting it. Ultimately, it will only add further to Australia's excellent reputation as a maritime nation. The Australian flag industry is renowned throughout the world as being a reputable one. We are fast gathering a reputation for being tough on ships of shame, as they are now commonly called; and AMSA is gaining a reputation for being able to pick up a number of these ships that are not up to standard, although from time to time ships do sneak through the net. Indeed, even the

I think all of us would like to see more inspections undertaken by AMSA to ensure that as many vessels as possible are inspected to enable us to be satisfied that few ships slip through the net.

         As I have said, we have a very high standard here in Australia but it is worth making the point, as I have made on other occasions, that safety and proper operating procedures are only the product of a viable shipping industry. It is  absolutely important that, whether we are talking about shipping, aircraft, road transport or whatever, safety depends upon the viability of the industry. One of the craziest things that I have seen go through this parliament in recent times was the decision made by this government in the last budget to increase the excise on fuel. This particularly hit hard for the Australian shipping industry. Bunker oil had the excise on it almost, but not quite, doubled. Some late negotiations reduced the proposed new excise, but there was a huge increase in cost to the Australian shipping industry.

         If memory serves me right again, there was an increase of about $287,000 per vessel per year as a result of the fuel excise increase, when on the same day as the budget the shipping industry had just completed its latest round of reforms reducing crew sizes, saving it $217,000 per vessel per year. So here we have Australian shipowners making a genuine attempt to reduce their costs, to make them genuinely internationally competitive, to enable them to have an industry with a future, to enable them to offer people who work within that industry a job in the long term—all being done by the industry in a most satisfactory fashion—and the government in its budget statement taking away all of that advantage the industry had just created for itself, and some, by loading an extra excise on bunker oil, whacking up the cost of running the average ship around Australia to the tune of about $287,000 a year. That is stupid and I think my colleagues on the other side—particularly those who take an interest in this area, like the honourable member for Throsby and the honourable member for Shortland (Mr Peter Morris)—though they may not agree with me publicly, would agree with me in their own hearts that that is a silly thing to do and the government should be condemned for doing it.

         It is worth making the point in these sorts of debates that, if we are to be talking about ship safety, occupational health and safety and proper operating procedures on Australian vessels, then we must take into account the ability of Australian shipowners to operate their businesses viably. Decisions like the one we saw in the last budget hinder that process and only harm Australia's capacity to have a world renowned high standard of safety within its shipping industry. They therefore also reduce our ability to protect the Australian coastline because, if we cannot afford the best safety procedures and the best operating procedures, one of these days one of our ships will run up onto the reef and do a great deal of damage to the reef, our tourism industry and our international reputation.

Given that we are an island continent with thousands of miles of coastline and a nation more dependent than most on sea traffic for our imports and exports, we have been remarkably free of marine pollution. I have said before in this chamber that this is more through luck than anything else, especially considering that much of the trade to and from Australia is currently traversing through our prime tourist attraction, the Great Barrier Reef.

If we as a nation are short-sighted enough to sell off the ANL, we will need this legislation much more than ever before. By selling off the ANL, we will be opening our sea lanes up to the rust buckets of the world. Much has been written in recent years about the threat to our coastline by oil spills. We have seen dramatic film footage of the

So what is Australia's response to the economic, social and environmental challenge of the world's ageing fleet? Some are proposing that we opt out; that we sell off our national line. Honourable members can be assured that, as soon as we sell off the ANL to overseas interests, other Australian flags will also opt out. For example, the BHP fleet could be owned by Hong Kong interests, registered in Cyprus and flying the Cyprus flag, with Greek officers and a crew which is a mixture of Burmese and Filipinos.

         Are we prepared to put the future of our trade in the hands of foreign shipping interests? Make no mistake: if we sell off the ANL, this is what we will be doing. Instead of talking about selling off ANL, we should be talking about investing in more Australian ships. If we were really serious about protecting the Australian maritime environment, there would be no talk of selling off ANL. We are more likely to be able to protect our environment if we are dealing with our own registered flagged and crewed ships.

         I note that there are recommendations in the proposed legislation about payment for the maritime damage. I have some worry about who would actually pay for the damage. I know the legislation makes specific recommendations. These recommendations are fine as long as the money is there. When we talk about a major environmental disaster, many millions of dollars are involved. Today, with the international markets as they are, it is often difficult to find out who owns a ship or a cargo. Ships and cargoes are traded on the international exchange like anything else. We often find that someone might own part of a cargo or a ship or have an interest in part of a ship for a journey or part of a journey.

There has already been danger. There has been great damage done to the oysters in Twofold Bay in New South Wales where the ships come in from Japan to pick up our woodchip and take it back. In Twofold Bay they dispose their ballast water, which was picked up from Tokyo harbour or from wherever they picked it up, carrying all sorts of organisms which get into the oysters. People have told me about the conditions of the oysters now in Twofold Bay. It is yet another example of why we should not be exporting our woodchip. I do not think that as a nation, as a parliament, or even as a government, we have given enough attention as to how ballast water is disposed of and the dangers that it is posing to the Australian coastline and to the marine environment.

         It was on 12 February 1992 that we decided that we should introduce a scheme of multi-designation on Australia's scheduled airline services. There are bilateral arrangements which govern Australia's rights to designate Australian carriers for scheduled services. Each bilateral arrangement, to which Australia is a party, in fact includes a clause under which substantial ownership and effective control must be vested in the nationals of the country designating the airline or airlines. Under that particular clause the country to which a designated Australian carrier operates has the right to withhold, revoke or even suspend operating permission if Australia cannot demonstrate to the other country's satisfaction that its designated airlines meet national ownership and control tests. The object of these amendments is to enable the government to ensure that any Australian carrier seeking designation, or already designated on an international route, can demonstrate its compliance with bilateral requirements that it is substantially owned and effectively controlled by Australian nationals.

         This amendment in fact gives the minister the power to require information as to the shareholding of Australia's international airlines and the power to require a vesture of foreign airline shareholding in an Australian international airline where equity held by foreign airlines and aggregate exceeds 35 per cent, or where equity by a single foreign airline exceeds 25 per cent.

         It is probably timely that this particular piece of legislation be passed by the House. I say that for a couple of reasons. Firstly, we have already seen the sale of 25 per cent of Qantas Airways to British Airways. We are looking forward to the ultimate, although highly delayed, float of Qantas. The privatisation of the remainder of Qantas Airways does give foreign investors the opportunity to come in. That is where the 35 per cent shut off point comes in.

         We were also interested to read in the last few days of a possible arrangement between Ansett Airlines and the German carrier Lufthansa. It has been suggested in some press reports that Lufthansa might be taking some equity in Ansett Australia. If that happens, we will also have that double problem: we will have some foreign ownership of both major carriers, Ansett and Qantas. There is also the possibility of a third international airline in Australia soon—if and when the funds can be arranged for that carrier to get off the ground and meet its obligations under the arrangements that have been made by the International Air Services Commission—to service China.

         We have also seen evidence that some countries hold up the provisions of these arrangements very strictly indeed. The case comes to mind of the situation that developed with the privatisation of British Airways. Some major negotiation went on between the British government and the United States government on the rights of British Airways to operate into the United States; at one stage the foreign shareholding had slightly exceeded the 35 per cent mark. Also, there were major negotiations regarding the British Airways acquisition of a percentage of the US domestic and international carrier US Air. While I suppose one could suggest that they might have a little more to do with the bartering of air rights between the United States and Great Britain, British Airways could have been denied access to the United States if these procedures had not been under control.

         If we look around the world at the arrangements that are being made at the moment with the grouping together of airlines, at the commercial arrangements that are being made between numbers of foreign carriers, obviously there is room for some countries to object to the access of particular carriers into their country if these provisions are not met. Therefore, the opposition welcomes these amendments to the Air Navigation Act so that we can make sure any Australian airline operating overseas has the capacity to meet those obligations and thus avoid any situation where an Australian carrier is denied access to a particular country, otherwise we might be subjected to protracted negotiations. The opposition welcomes and supports these amendments.

         Firstly, though, I agree with what the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) said of the ANL shipping line. To sell off Australia's only shipping carrier would be ludicrous. I think it was the Bruce government which tried to do that back in 1929-30. It got nowhere then, and I do not believe it will get anywhere now. We need our own shipping line. We are an island nation and it is important that we have our own ships, at least to know exactly what is going on in the shipping world with the transportation of our goods. We would be held to ransom if we did not have our own shipping line.

         The Shell-Mobil Crib Point terminal handling facility at Western Port Bay is used by many Australian or ANL boats.

        Approval of the project rests almost entirely with the Victorian Government, the only Commonwealth role being in the initial approval of the foreign investment for acquisition of the site.

        Ramsar, of course, is the agreement we have with overseas nations in relation to migratory birds. Briefly, what is happening at Crib Point is that Shell and Mobil are proposing to significantly increase the importation of heavy crude oil for the refineries at Geelong and Altona. They intend to do this in tankers—not their own—of around about 150,000 tonnes. Those tankers will be brought into Crib Point, which is a deepwater port. There they will offload half of the oil and transport the rest of it up Port Phillip Bay to their Altona and Geelong refineries.

         The tanker traffic in the area will increase quite significantly.

If this proposal goes ahead, it will mean there will be an extra 180 tanker passages between Western Port and Port Phillip Bay. Given the increase in the number of tankers that will be used, the risk of an accident happening must also increase.

We are heading towards a 93 per cent risk of something happening. Just imagine what would happen if one of these tankers went aground at The Nobbies at Phillip Island at the entrance to Western Port Bay.

         Just around the corner from The Nobbies is a major Australian tourist attraction—the penguin parade.

If it were wiped out—it could happen; we have had examples of hundreds of penguins being killed by oil spills just off the Otways—it would ruin this magnificent tourist attraction. It would destroy the economy of many people on Phillip Island and around Western Port Bay. I believe that it would even destroy the economy of Melbourne, because the Japanese tourists who flock to those particular penguin parades of a night would no longer go there.

         That is why I am so adamant that this expansion by Shell and Mobil should not go ahead.

Those groups have done a tremendous job, pointing out the dangers to this huge conglomerate of two oil companies. They are continuing to point it out and I think they are winning.

         I believe there should be a transportation levy placed on Shell and Mobil for shifting this fuel around. If they do go ahead with this proposed development and they shift fuel from Western Port to Port Phillip Bay there has to be a problem. There is a higher risk and therefore an oil levy should be placed on them, based on the amount of oil they transport. That would go into some trust fund, perhaps capped at a certain amount, say, $14 million or $15 million. When the contributions reach that level, then maybe the interest on that amount can be used for the Environment Protection Agency or for some research or something on the two bays.

We have plenty of oil here in Australia; we are finding it all the time. It is to do with export dollars and our balance of payments, and so on.

Recently in Victoria there have been outbreaks of various red algae in Port Phillip Bay. We are particularly concerned about the starfish that have appeared in Tasmania. The larvae of these starfish were taken there by ballast water.

         <emphasis font-slant="ITAL">
          Australian Magazine
         </emphasis>
         of 26 March 1994 relating to oil spills. I read it and thought, `Who is actually paying for this?' It was written in such a way that one would think those who produced it were having a go at the oil companies. But when I looked a bit closer I found that the people who actually paid for this are the Australian Petroleum Exploration Association; AMSA, the body set up by the oil companies to correct any spills; the Australian Marine Oil Spills Centre; Caltex; and the Department of Industry, Technology and Regional Development. All of that goes to putting up this fairly neutral story on how oil spills are not really that bad, how they can be fixed and how we all should feel warm and fuzzy about them.

At the time the court case was under way, Shell was up for a fine of $125,000. Shell probably has a turnover of $125,000 a second throughout the world—I do not know; it is huge—so that fine would have been nothing. We have to have some decent teeth.

         Companies claim that they are doing these things and that they are spending some money, but I do not believe it is enough. A separate fund should be set up which puts a levy on all these oil companies. This will ensure that when they do breach regulations and there is a spill they pay for it. How much is one penguin worth? No-one can put a price on it. According to this article, it is worth a few hundred thousand dollars.

         As already mentioned by previous speakers, while these amendments will ensure that foreign flag polluters or so-called ships of shame are held accountable while in Australian waters, I also wish to highlight today the ship safety anomaly which, if rectified, could stop polluters from being allowed to operate along our coastline in the first place. I appreciate what the honourable member for Dunkley (Mr Chynoweth) said about the need to have some sort of trust fund. I understood that there was one in place. If we get to the root of the problem, rather than trying to fix up the mess at the end, we might be more effective.

         The amendments to the Protection of the Sea (Civil Liability) Act 1981 provide for the recovery of losses, damages, costs or expenses incurred by the Australian Maritime Safety Authority in the exercise of its duties to combat pollution of the marine environment caused by a discharge or disposal from a ship. AMSA's right of recovery would be limited to those parties which have been proven responsible for a pollution breach. Quite rightly, ship owners should be responsible for all forms of discharges from their vessels, from ballast waters, which, as the honourable member for Dunkley said, could contain harmful micro-organisms, to garbage and waste disposal and to fuel oil spills—all of which have a damaging impact on sensitive marine environments.

         The second set of amendments deals with the Protection of the Sea (Prevention of Pollution from Ships) Act 1983 and provides for the detention of foreign vessels suspected of causing marine pollution within Australian waters. The need for such detention powers over foreign ships can be seen in that the act allows legal action to be taken against Australian ships wherever they are. However, Australian jurisdiction over foreign vessels is limited to Australian waters only. AMSA should be given the power to detain foreign vessels that pollute, as Australian ships already face similar measures in foreign ports, including most EEC countries. Often the detention will only see the offending ship post a bond or security before sailing on—a sort of guarantee, if you like, until investigations are complete. I support the thrust of these matters.

         It is, I believe, all about responsibility and making sure that the culprits pay. There is too much at risk, particularly in my electorate where there are busy ports operating on the doorstep of the Great Barrier Reef. As an example, let us take the port of Gladstone in Central Queensland, one of the most efficient and modern ports in Australia. Last financial year, 1992-93, it handled a record cargo throughput of 33.1 million tonnes valued at $2.8 billion, including 23.9 million tonnes of exports to 32 countries valued at $2.1 billion and imports from 12 destinations totalling 9.2 million tonnes worth $700 million.

Legitimate foreign vessels should not be made scapegoats for the government's failure to enforce its own maritime safety standards.

However, returning to the matter before the House, we must take greater responsibility for the protection of our coastline. Tightening the permit system to include foreign bulk carriers is a positive step. I am disappointed that the government has decided not to act more positively but rather to rely on the existing inspection regime, the same system which allowed the

I am conscious of what the honourable member for Dunkley said about an efficiency audit. At the very least, if we are going to maintain the current practice of only inspecting 25 per cent of these vessels on average we should add extra resources to AMSA by way of intelligence gathering facilities and staff so that we can be ready for such vessels when they come to Australian waters.

As has been mentioned by previous speakers, the bill encompasses amendments to a number of acts. A number of changes relate to the way the Protection of the Sea (Prevention of Pollution from Ships) Act 1983 applies in the exclusive economic zone. It clarifies provisions which require foreign vessels to provide information to determine whether a pollution breach has occurred. It also clarifies the powers to inspect vessels in the economic zone and the express power to bring people into port, and generally tidies up some of the legislation that has already passed this House.

         That has led to the question of the inspection of vessels operating under single-voyage permits. We are looking at that in the current resumption of the inquiry into substandard shipping. We have had some information about that. I think it is fairly clear to most members of the Standing Committee on Transport, Communications and Infrastructure that vessels operating under single-voyage permits must be subject to inspection, preferably a mandatory inspection. The Australian Mining Industry Council has called for the mandatory inspection of all vessels operating on the Australian coast under single-voyage permits, so what I have just said is not something that is radical. It is not something that is tougher for Australia than what is being put forward by the organisation that represents the major users, the Australian Mining Industry Council. That is something we are going to come back to later as we proceed through the consideration of the evidence being brought before the committee.

They were particularly concerned about vessels carrying hazardous cargoes travelling their waters.

They discussed a further amendment to the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea to provide that ships carrying oil, harmful substances and dangerous goods follow predetermined routes. That is, the route to be followed by the master of a vessel in completing its journey would not be one of his selection but would be a prescribed route, similar to what we have on the Australian coast in some areas.

         It touches also on the question of crewing of ships. It was said before that a good crew will save a bad ship in a time of crisis but a bad crew will destroy a good ship in a time of crisis. No matter the condition of the vessel, priority one has to be the competency of the crews.

It was not the structure of the vessel or condition of the vessel; it was the performance of the crews on both vessels. So surveyors will seek to ensure, when they carry out these port state control inspections under these new proposals for Europe, that crews comply with minimum training standards and are aware of their duties on the master list.

         That goes to the core of the problem: the training agencies themselves are a motley collection. We know that the Philippines is a major source of recruitment of seafarers. But many of those seafarers carry phoney qualifications. A few of the training agencies do have world standing and do meet competency standards but many of them do not. There has not yet been sufficient response around the world to this question of ensuring that crews meet competency standards. We made recommendations in our report that there should be a standard set and approved by the International Maritime Organisation.

Until the major trading nations of the world face up to this question of ensuring that crews are adequately trained, we are still going to have an extremely serious problem. I am very pleased to see that the European Commission in its recommendations to its ministers and to the European parliament is proposing that the competency of crews be taken into account.

         Another issue that enables much of this substandard operation to survive and the dangers to continue to be created is the conspiracy of silence, as I like to describe it. I think it is most regrettable that in recent weeks the Salvage Association of the United Kingdom has determined that it will no longer release publicly the results of its inspections. It gives some reasons for that, saying that the number of vessels that it now inspects has declined considerably over the last decade. It expresses some reservation about the use to which that information is put. But to me, and I hope to this parliament, those excuses can be seen only as excuses. The effect of it will be to help cover up the abuse of seafarers, the exploitation of seafarers and the dangers of what is going on.

Much of this abuse can happen only because peculiarly in the shipping industry everything is to be secret; it is commercially confidential. It is that conspiracy of silence, that cloak, that enables these abuses to go on. So it is great to see that the European Community, hopefully, will pick up this recommendation from the European Commission and move now to publish that information. The US Coast Guard already makes that information available on a regular basis. It does not have any problem with it.

Let the cargo owner who wants to use a substandard ship, a ship of shame, stand up, identify his or her business and product, and say, `I am prepared to create these risks and to endanger the lives of the seafarers on board that vessel to get the cheap rate that it offers.'

The US Coast Guard is also moving to categorise those flag states which do not carry out their responsibilities as flag states. We know there are flag states that stand out as the home of substandard shipping: Malta, Cyprus, Panama. We could go on through the range of them. But what the US is going to do is to look at three-year averages on the number of vessels detained under those flags and publish that information. That will help put focus upon what is going on with a flag state and put pressure upon the flag state to carry out its responsibilities.

You can tie a substandard ship to the buoy, park it by the wharf, and it cannot do very much harm. Admittedly, the vessel can leak oil or whatever but, in relative terms, it can do little harm. It becomes a danger to those who work on it and it is a danger to the waters in which it travels when a cargo owner says that he wants to use that vessel. There are plenty of instances where the same cargo owners use the same type of vessel, obviously because it is the cheapest vessel that they can get.

          This whole issue of competition is very important in aviation. It comes from a broad government agenda about competition; it comes out of the Hilmer report. In telecommunications and the whole range of infrastructure provision around the country there are important gains to be made in productivity from having competition between infrastructure providers, particularly in the aviation industry. It is important to understand not only do we need good legislation to provide competition between airlines but also we need a commitment to competition between airports.

         Last week the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) in a landmark speech in Melbourne outlined his important framework for achieving those goals. This is an issue that is very important to me as the member for Werriwa. When I contested the by-election, my leading promise was to establish an international airport at Badgerys Creek. It will be a very important competitor for the large aviation market currently serviced at Kingsford Smith in east Sydney. I mentioned this in my maiden speech. I cannot explain how flattered I was to have faxed through to my office later that day a press release from the shadow minister for tourism and aviation, the honourable member for Fadden (Mr Jull). The headline of the press release said `Latham shows Labor the way on Badgerys Creek'.

The shadow minister might also have to reconsider the matter of public importance he has listed about government administration of civil aviation, because there is no better way to administer the aviation industry than that being pursued by the Minister for Transport.

         I note also that there has been some media speculation about how feasible the international airport in Sydney's west will be. The argument fed by the FAC is that it has done a survey of all the existing operators at Kingsford Smith. Many have said, according to the hypothetical survey, that they want to stay at Mascot, defend their existing investments and downplay the role of a second international airport in Sydney. Of course, that is what they are going to say in hypothetical circumstances. The existing operators, posed that question, will always say, `We will defend our interests and our large investment at our existing location. We will downplay the role of the second airport.'

         A study in November 1993 by Economic and Energy Analysis and the National Institute of Economic and Industry Research in Melbourne showed that, by the year 2000, 26 per cent of air passengers in Sydney will live closer to Badgerys Creek than Mascot. That means there will be a catchment area for Sydney West international airport of more than five million passengers per annum. As well, one-third of companies exporting air freight out of Sydney will be located closer to Badgerys Creek than Mascot. That is, 48,000 tonnes of air freight per annum will be exported out of the catchment area for Sydney west international airport.

         These are quite significant figures because this will be the third largest aviation market in Australia after Kingsford Smith and Tullamarine. Quite frankly, no airline and no freight forwarder can ignore such a market. If they do turn their backs on that sort of market, they run a very high risk from new entrants in a competitive airline industry locating at Sydney west international airport, tapping into the third largest—and fastest growing—aviation market in Australia, and making substantial profits. Once the hypothetical surveys are put to one side, the truth is that according to basic market forces those operators must follow their customers to the very large catchment in Sydney's west and south-west. It is an outstanding initiative for the government and the Minister for Transport to introduce competition across the board for aviation and airports, and for the government to recognise the importance of these reforms, as part of the white paper process.

         For my region, in the south-west of Sydney—which has had high unemployment for a number of decades now, under governments of all persuasions, and a high proportion of long-term unemployed—this is a very significant day. It is the first time a national government in Australia has not only attempted to make the long-term unemployed jobs ready but also attempted in regions with high unemployment to make jobs available, to match up both sides of the labour market.

         With regard to the benefits to employment, a report by the national institute in 1991 detailed the substantial employment benefits of the new airport through competition, with the creation of at least 36,000 new jobs in the region over the next 20 years. That means much more than jobs coming out of airport construction or out of airport operation. It is a major regional economic development opportunity, because of the cluster of industries that will locate around the airport site. That is, the government is using infrastructure policy and competition policies at a national and regional level to achieve jobs in a region that badly needs them.

         The FAC has developed a flawed model about aviation movements in Sydney. It is called the residual development model, and it is something like a glass of water overflowing. The unrealistic assumption is that there will be no demand at Sydney west international airport until such time as Kingsford Smith has saturated its capacity. That is to say, when they cannot fit one more plane on the runways at Kingsford Smith or deal with one more freight forwarding opportunity, then—and only then—will these operators look to Sydney's west and its aviation market which is bigger than Adelaide or Brisbane, and bigger than any airport in Australia other than Kingsford Smith and Tullamarine.

         The changes that Minister Brereton has put forward, and which will come into effect, will ensure that we get a bit of competition in the airport industry in Australia. Surely this other monopoly, the Federal Airports Corporation, should be opened up to competition, if the airlines tell us they are in favour of competition and if the government has told other GBEs that they should be open to competition. It has told Telecom that it should be forced into competition. As part of that forced change, there are some amendments to Telecom's legislation in this bill that are directly related to Telecom having competition.

         The opposition is not much better. Its answer is to sell the Federal Airports Corporation; this replaces a public monopoly with a private monopoly. That is just as silly. What we need in this area is proper competition. One of the most competitive regimes that could be put together in Australia would be created if there were one owner for Badgerys Creek and Tullamarine. It could get into competition with this large government business enterprise which has been busy spreading half-truths around the country for so long. We would then see the proper development of Badgerys Creek and the movement of an asset to the people in the industry who can use it.

         If it is good enough to have airports in markets that are smaller than that market, it is certainly good enough to have a proper airport that can take international traffic at Badgerys Creek. It will ensure that the airport industry in Australia reacts as it has in the rest of the world, with a smaller, inner city airport, dealing with some international traffic but mostly with domestic traffic, and a bigger international operator out on the city rim.

         The people of my electorate and the electorates around the airport have no problem with Sydney airport being involved to a greater extent with domestic traffic. Domestic passengers tend not to want to fly at midnight or at 5.00 a.m., and the curfew can work safely there and not be of detriment to the operators. It can be a positive boon, in fact, to the people who live around the airport. Domestic jets are in the main not as heavy as and are less noisy than those of the international operators that are coming into Sydney airport now.

Although this Transport and Communications Legislation Amendment Bill contains mainly machinery measures, honourable members have taken the opportunity to express some fairly strongly held views in a range of areas in which they are, in many ways, quite expert.

         As I stated in the second reading speech, the bill does not introduce any substantial new policy measures and can be summed up as follows: some amendments to the Air Navigation Act will ensure that Australian airlines that are designated as international carriers under international agreements are substantially controlled and owned by Australian nationals. In fact, they have to continue to be that in order to be the designated national carrier. That comes about through the government's decision to float the ownership of Qantas. It means that Qantas, in fact, must have at least 65 per cent Australian ownership to continue to be described as the national carrier.

         The bill also contains some amendments to the Telecommunications Act, which simply change the name to reflect the new trading position of Telecom and Telstra—as it is called in its international operations. There are some amendments to the Navigation Act which tidy up the validity of some exemptions to the act and particularly—and I think this is a very important one—give the maritime authority the power to collect the costs of cleaning up the pollution that is caused particularly by foreign vessels operating in Australian waters. We do not have any difficulty through our various schemes in dealing with Australian shipping in Australian waters, but the ability to collect the costs and force contributions to the fund from foreign vessels is tidied up in this legislation.

         Part 2 of this bill amends the Disability Services Act 1986 to provide for the recovery of costs incurred by the Commonwealth in the provision of rehabilitation programs. It has been a longstanding practice in the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service to serve notices in relation to the recovery of rehabilitation costs on insurers prior to the settlement or conclusion of litigation between the insurer and the insured person. The amendment will provide legislative backing for notices to be served in time for the debt to the Commonwealth to be considered as part of the negotiations prior to the settlement of the compensation claim. Under current legislation there is no requirement for the party deemed liable to pay compensation to discharge the debt to the Commonwealth before paying the person receiving the compensation. This has led to situations where the Commonwealth has had to recover moneys from its rehabilitation client. The amendment will ensure that the insurer pays the debt to the Commonwealth before award moneys are disbursed.

         The Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service is responsible for the delivery of rehabilitation services to workers compensation authorities. These services account for 32 per cent of CRS service delivery and are revenue raising for the Commonwealth. The Disability Services Act 1986 does not allow for the CRS to claim payment for rehabilitation services prior to service delivery. In the past CRS has encountered problems attempting to recover moneys from workers compensation authorities after services have been rendered. As a result, this has often led to cost recovery from CRS rehabilitation clients rather than from the relevant authority. The amendments before the House today will overcome the past recovery difficulties and administrative delays by allowing CRS to claim funds from workers compensation authorities prior to service delivery for clients.

         The coalition supports this concept as the outcome will be a step towards better accountability of government revenue. The question of government accountability has, of course, a familiar ring to it. Already in this first week of a new parliamentary sitting we have heard much about the need for greater accountability in relation to the spending of public moneys. Yesterday's matter of public importance debate about the fraudulent use of funds expended under the Department of Employment, Education and Training programs highlighted the government's accountability problems. It is yet another demonstration of the government's inability to monitor programs and account for disbursement of funds. In the last parliamentary sitting it was its famous sports rorts affair. In the spring sittings it is a question of watch this space for the next example of extravagant waste of taxpayers money by a government which has lost the plot.

         The Keating government's lack of regard for the contribution made by parents caring for their children at home is demonstrated by the yawning gap between the child-care cash rebate—which is worth $61.20 per week for two children—and the home child-care allowance, set at a maximum $60 per fortnight. The 840,000 families across Australia in the latter category have a right to feel cheated. Their caring for their children at home is deemed to have about half the value of child care received by the 230,000 families who will receive the rebate.

Unfortunately, with the cashing out of the dependent spouse rebate, the government has done nothing to extend support to those parents whose family priorities result in one parent staying home to care for their small children. This cashing out of the dependent spouse rebate and turning it into the home child-care allowance will not make a jot of difference to the ability of the average single income family's ability to provide basic necessities and to meet the cost of raising children.

         Work by the Social Policy Research Centre has demonstrated that families earning between $20,000 and $40,000 a year have been the big losers under Labor. Research by the Department of Social Security has shown that since 1983 when this Labor government was first elected a single income couple with two children on average weekly earnings is now nearly five per cent worse off in real terms. Other research studies have shown that there is no net assistance from government to families with dependent children. These families enjoy a real standard of living about three-fifths that of the rest of the adult working population.

         The message back in the late 1960s and early 1970s was one of the right of choice for women of not being put into a particular mould, of rejecting the assumption that once they married they must have children and they must stay at home and look after those children full time or else they were unnatural women. The situation now seems to be a 180-degree turn which indicates that the arguments that were being put forward in those days have never been understood in all the intervening years. We have it encapsulated by those child-care financial provisions.

In fact, it advocated it in the 1984 federal election and has done so in every election since. It would make fascinating reading indeed to go back over the statements of various Labor Party ministers and private members in the intervening years to find out why there could be no rebate where there were two parents in employment.

She is on the record time and again, particularly as Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for the Status of Women, as saying why one could not have a rebate for child-care costs when those child-care costs were related to earning an income. The statements are legion. Those statements are, of course, now flicked aside and not referred to at all by the government. There is no attempt at justification of why it has taken over 10 years for this government to recognise that child-care costs can be a necessary expense of earning an income.

         I repeat, the coalition has long since recognised that need in its policies and went to the election 10 years ago on policies to that effect. So we are not opposed to the rebate. What we are opposed to is the situation the woman who chooses the other option—which was the so-called traditional option—is now put into, and how she is treated in contrast to the career woman.

         It is highly relevant that we have this debate at the moment, because there is a lot of debate also going on about the subject of women in politics. I have really been itching for the opportunity to say this. The trouble we have with the subject of affirmative action or encouraging women into parliament is that, to this very day, the contribution of the full-time wife and mother is still regarded as zero by this community. That is the problem that women have at preselection councils. One of the government members opposite is nodding her head in agreement; it is the honourable member for Bass (Mrs Silvia Smith).

         If we were to look at the profile of the women in this parliament, we would find the following facts. A number of those women are not married and have no children. A number are married and have no children. A number of the rest married, had children, and—when their children were of a certain age, an age of independence—came into parliament. That tells you something. I came in comparatively young, and childless. All the women who have come in here at an age on a par with men have come in childless. The honourable member for Canberra (Mrs Ros Kelly) is the exception: she had children after she became a member. A profile of the women in parliament will also show that very few of them came in here without having subsequently pursued a professional career of some kind.

This is indeed the real struggle. Such women are not regarded as professional people by their political parties. Their backgrounds are considered to be irrelevant in terms of a recommendation for service in the nation's parliament. That is the issue that the parties must address, whether through quotas—in the Labor Party's case—or through the leader's support, in the Liberal Party's case. It is an issue, furthermore, that society must also address.

         The really sad thing about this child-care funding change is that it has only taken the step of recognising that caring for children is important in our community. If a decision to work means that children must be put into paid child care, then it certainly should be recognised that that expense is a necessary part of that parent's going to work and it is recognised through the child-care cash rebate. However, what it still has not recognised is that child care by a parent, usually the mother, is as valuable to society. Until that is done, then none of us women, whatever our background—whether professional women, childless, or whatever—has made real pro

         As I said earlier, what women were reacting against, starting in the 1960s and through into the 1970s, was being shoved into a mould where a woman was not considered normal if she did not marry and have children, and then stay home and look after them full time. We pushed for the right of choice and we said that, in the case of certain families, the option of the second parent—the mother—going to work could be better for a family, and that each family had the right of choice. What I have objected to here today is the financial penalty when the family decides that the better decision is for the second parent—usually the mother—to stay at home and look after the children, but does not then have the equivalent financial support.

         This principle was established some time ago. Back in 1977 or 1978, the Fraser government abolished the child endowment payment which went to the mother, and replaced it with the family allowance, a very much upgraded and higher income for the mother. At the same time, it abolished the dependent child rebate. The rationale was perfect: the dependent child rebate had been paid to the parent who did not have prime responsibility for the rearing of the family's children; it went to the taxpayer, the father. Abolishing it, and moving it across to the family's child rearer—cashing it out, as it were—to supersede the child endowment payment meant that the parent who was doing the child caring and rearing got the benefit of that rebate thereafter.

         This bill, of course, cashes out the dependent spouse rebate with the same rationale. I have no difficulty with that rationale. The rationale is the same.

         Firstly, the big winners were those on low incomes because the actual amount paid to them was not linked to income. It was the same for all families. People were not rebated according to their rate of taxation; they were rebated a set amount. So there was some financial equity there. The benefit paid did not depend on the amount of income earned.

         The second point of equity was that the family allowance recognised the economic contribution to this nation of child rearing. In those days, children were looked after much more in the home than through the child care arrangements that we have these days.

         These are very important principles. They are principles that were broken by the Hawke government when it means tested the family allowance. I objected to that means testing at the time, as did the opposition. Family allowance thus became the only benefit—other than Austudy—that was means tested according to the income of somebody other than the person receiving the benefit. It was an offensive principle. The wife's payment—the mother's payment—was means tested according to the husband's income. As I said, the only other case where that happens is Austudy, which necessarily incorporates principles of dependency. The Fraser government's family allowance never incorporated principles of dependency. It was a principle of contribution. It acknowledged the principle of doing something worthwhile—child rearing—being recognised through the government revenue system. The Labor government means tested it, however.

How would the men here feel if their salaries were set according to what their wives' salaries might be outside parliament? It is not a principle any one of us accepts as individuals. We all expect to receive remuneration according to the job we are doing and by an objective measure, and that is what the family allowance used to be.

         However, Labor means tested it and decided that, because some women had husbands of an income of a certain level, those women's contribution in the full-time mothering role was to no longer be recognised, or was to receive less recognition. That is utterly obnoxious on principle. Family allowance was never a welfare payment under a Liberal government. I repeat that it was a cashing out of the dependent child rebate, a transfer of child endowment into what was at the time stated, in words of one syllable, as a recognition of the value of the child-rearing role.

         Of course, if a parent wanted to then put the children into child care—the family allowance was not paid only to people who were full-time parents—and use that money to pay for child care, that was their choice. And that was the correct principle. All speeches by Liberal, Labor and National party parliamentarians at the time recognised and supported that principle. It was the Hawke government that moved away from it and got us into this real muddle of principles that we have at the moment.

         The family allowance has gone. It is now the family assistance supplement, which is means tested, and goes only to families in need. I have no problem with special payments to families in need. The Fraser government brought in the family income support payment, which was additional to family allowances, to assist low income families. That payment was also put into the family assistance supplement. We no longer have the family allowance. We no longer have a recognition that child rearing benefits everyone, and should be supported by this community. That recognition has gone under Labor.

          Instead we have a child-care rebate, which we support, and the cashing out of yet another rebate—the dependent spouse rebate—for the home child-care allowance, which is not good enough. Whilst I take no objection to government members, men or women, saying nice things about the child-care cash rebate—we support it and it should be supported—it is incumbent on members of the government, particularly women members, to go back to the government and ask, `Are we fair dinkum about the importance of child care? Why is it so much more important when someone other than a parent does it? Why is it that we will give this sort of recognition to someone who is paid to do it as a job, yet we give such puny recognition to a parent who does it? Is child care of value or is it not? If it is of value, why is it financially downgraded when it is done—usually—by the mother?' Let us face it, 90 per cent of the time the value of what we do in our community is measured in money. The contribution we are making for the work we do is measured by the financial return we get.

         I repeat: a parent who stays at home to look after the children and who gets an income—not necessarily earns it—from, say, shares or a savings account starts to be financially penalised when that income exceeds 78c per day. Either the job they are doing is of value and is therefore financially recognised, without a means test, or it is of no value. The child-care rebate to parents who work outside the home is not means tested. I would certainly support neither of the payments being means tested.

         As I said at the beginning, the coalition supports the bill because it approves of what is happening in the area of rehabilitation in terms of proper financial administration and recoupment of government expenses, and approves of the child-care rebate. However, we differ on some very significant points which go to the principle and the detail of the government's child-care provisions—not least how they reflect on the real status of women in Australian society.

Firstly, it will amend the Disability Services Act 1986 where it talks about recovery of costs of rehabilitation programs provided by the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service. The amendment to section 23 of the act will cover the capacity of the Commonwealth to recover compensation.

         An amendment to section 23(5) brings this legislation into line with what has been common practice in the government for many years. It has been the practice to serve notices in relation to the recovery of rehabilitation costs on insurers prior to the settlement of the litigation between the insurer and the insured person on the basis that the insurer is the person liable to pay compensation referred to in the act. It is accepted that no payment would be received until the court case has been settled.

Once more, she has been guilty in her comments of only selectively outlining some of the provisions of the Commonwealth in support of families. She has indicated that she feels there is a yawning discrepancy between what we are paying in the home child-care allowance, which is a $30 per week payment, to the spouse remaining at home for the care of children and what we will be paying in the child-care cash rebate system, which is up to a maximum of $61. She claims that this shows a huge discrepancy and discrimination against those families where one spouse remains at home and cares for the family.

         However, the honourable member failed to talk about all the other components of the government's comprehensive program of support for families.

         The government recognises the important contribution to society and to the economy of the unpaid work undertaken by those people who remain at home caring for children. It is recognised that in the vast majority of cases those people are mothers. The government also acknowledges that the skills of women with work force experience are also extremely valuable in an economy dependent upon the training and flexibility of the work force. So it is a question of getting the correct balance between the two competing needs within our economy.

         In properly assessing the impact of Commonwealth assistance for families, it is important to consider all of the allowances that we provide to families. The honourable member for Moncrieff talked about the home child-care allowance. What she has outlined is correct: it replaces and increases the dependent spouse rebate for families where one parent is caring for the children. Instead of the previous tax rebate being a tax concession that goes to the working partner, the taxpayer, we have now changed it to being a weekly payment to the carer of the child or children in the home. It will assist those families whose tax liability was previously too low to get the full value of the dependent spouse rebate.

         The home child-care allowance and the Commonwealth child-care cash rebate, which we are ensuring is implemented through this amendment today, will assist families with children, whatever their employment status. They respond to work force participation patterns, which suggest that today most women will spend some time in the paid work force and some time at home caring for their children. The child-care cash rebate will be of great assistance to many women seeking to re-enter the work force through retraining or education. The home child-care allowance will be claimed by women leaving the paid work force to have children.

         Since 1983 the government has substantially improved assistance to low income families with children, including single income families. For example, between 1983 and 1993 additional family payments for children in low income families increased in real terms by 75 per cent for a child under 13 years and 147 per cent for a child aged between 13 and 15. Rent assistance has also been extended to low income working families. In particular, these payments go to those families where there is a single income. They are very much a direct cash contribution and cash support to those families where one member of the partnership has remained at home to care for children. This support is paid to families with incomes under $60,000, with greater assistance targeted to lower income families with incomes less than $25,000.

         Let us examine a family earning $35,000, with both partners working—one earning $20,000 and one earning $15,000—renting privately and caring for one child under 13. If that family had another child and the partner earning $15,000 withdrew from the work force, that family would receive nearly $123 per week in tax-free family payments.

         It is quite incorrect for the honourable member for Moncrieff to make out that the only payment that this government makes to those families where one partner withdraws from the work force to remain at home caring for children is the $30 a week home child-care allowance. A much larger amount of money is paid through the family payment system. In addition to that $30 a week home child-care allowance, these families would qualify for $123 in family payment, making a total of $153 per week, tax free, in child related assistance.

         The home child-care allowance is expected to assist 840,000 families, at a total cost of $1.13 billion, which is $230 million more than we currently pay through the dependent spouse rebate. That is an additional $230 million a year that the Commonwealth will be providing to support those families where one partner remains at home to care for children. About 55,000 families who were not eligible to receive the dependent spouse rebate will now be eligible to receive the $60 per fortnight payment of the home child-care allowance.

         The home child-care allowance is also much more responsive to families whose circumstances change during the year, since it is based on current income rather than on income in the previous financial year, which was the way in which the dependent spouse rebate worked.

         When combined with the home child-care allowance, family payments make up a comprehensive package of support for families with children. The government will continue to provide access to child care for parents out of the paid work force for respite and occasional care. In addition, the government has increased child-care assistance, formerly known as fee relief, for occasional care. These forms of care are an essential service for women caring for children, as they allow them time to go shopping, to involve themselves in community organisations, or to attend to important family commitments.

That is certainly the position of this government. But we are trying to achieve effective choice where, if people wish to re-enter the work force, we assist them in doing that. We are doing that in a whole range of measures, not just in the support that we provide in our child-care programs.

They had the opportunity to introduce some of these measures and failed to do so. From 1949 to 1983, apart from three years of Labor government, coalition governments were in power. They did not move to introduce any of these alleged new major improvements, as coalition members are now urging the government to do, to support families in the home.

         The honourable member for Moncrieff also expressed her strong disagreement with the government's policy of introducing a means test on family payments. She made much of the fact that she believes family payments should go to all families regardless of their income because, by introducing a means test, we are making the carer—the partner who has no formal source of income—answerable to the partner who has a source of income when the carer seeks to get family support payments from the government. She is suggesting that we should not put a means test on family payments.

         Family payments are designed to assist families in meeting the additional costs of bearing children and raising them to adulthood. They are designed to bring about some equality between those families which have no children and those that have children, and to assist them with the additional costs of raising children. But, as a government, we have not got an unlimited pool of money and we cannot provide those family payments to every family regardless of their source of income. If we did that, we would have to raise taxation levels, which would impact negatively on low and middle income families and take away a lot of the benefit that we gain from family allowance payments. It is a nonsense to suggest that families that earn $100,000, $200,000 or $300,000 a year in income should be eligible for family allowance payments. Family allowance payments are designed to assist families that do not have sufficient income to meet the needs of raising children.

I wish the honourable member would work out exactly what her position is on this matter. When we introduced the child-care cash rebate, she attacked us for not putting a means test on it because it is a much more limited program targeted at a much more restrictive audience. We did not impose a means test on that, but she is now saying that it is wrong for us to impose a means test on family payments. So I do not know what she expects us to do. She attacks a means test in one area and then says that we should have imposed a means test in another area, both concerning family payments and designed to support families in the costs of raising children.

         —It gives me a great deal of pleasure to support my colleague the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) today. Any study of Australian families today shows that there has been a significant dramatic difference compared with the families of twenty years ago. Many more women are in the work force. They are either part-time or full-time employees or running their own businesses. Women today are much more orientated towards a career that will take them through their full working lives.

         Over the past five years, the growth in women's labour force participation has been about 4.5 per cent. Now more than 50 per cent of women with young children are in the work force. More importantly, the future growth of the Australian economy and the living standards of Australians will benefit from women's participation in the labour force. However, most women have different work force patterns from men. They can expect to have periods of their lives where they are out of the paid work force or working part time. Many women also need time to retrain or upgrade their skills because the nature of our work force changes as industrial needs change.

That is why it is absolutely vital that children receive quality care in these important formative years and that parents do not have to worry about how their child is being cared for.

         This government's record in building new child-care places is outstanding. It is important that the pace of growth is continued so that women have the confidence that they can find a child-care place when they need it. The government has also introduced a generous fee relief system which now assists two-thirds of families who use Commonwealth child-care centres. It is appropriately targeted to lower income families. We have a needs based planning system to make sure new child-care places go where they are needed most. Over three years $5.3 million dollars is being allocated to support an industry based national accreditation scheme for child-care centres. When this is fully operational, extra funding will be available for training and resource centres participating in the scheme. There are also initiatives which encourage employers to assist with the child-care needs of working families. The government already provides child-care assistance to almost 10,000 employer sponsored child places and existing tax benefits have encouraged the provision of many more.

         Research shows that children are likely to be sick as often as nine or 10 times a year, with the period of illness usually ranging from three days to a week or more. This load falls particularly on working mothers. The provision of child care for employers supports demonstrable productivity benefits, including the reduction of absenteeism and the retention of skilled staff. Employers are thus the major beneficiaries of child care.

An innovative new neighbourhood occasional care concept has also been introduced.

         In my own electorate hundreds of working families have benefited from this range of excellent programs. Our government also recognises that the cost of child care is a legitimate expense for women earning an income. That is why the child-care cash rebate is a great initiative. It will help families with the cost of child care associated with employment, training, education or job search. A feature of this support is that it is not income tested and will provide up to $61.20 per week for two or more children. Unlike a tax concession, the cash rebate is claimed as the cost is incurred, rather than up to 18 months later. That is why it is a fundamentally fairer system.

         It is fair to say that Western Australia joined the national corporations scheme of all the Australian jurisdictions I suppose with most reluctance and with most concern as to how the ASC would operate. I am pleased to be able to say that in the almost three years since the ASC has been an active operation in Western Australia it has built up a great deal of confidence in the local business community. The regional commissioner there, Murray Allen, I think has a good reputation amongst the local business community. That initial point should be made: the ASC is held in high regard among the users of the organisation.

         In terms of the allegation that not enough has been done to prosecute outstanding offences flowing from the excesses of the 1980s, again the facts do not coincide with what the Premier's allegations are. Since 1 July 1991, in Western Australia alone there have been 13 successful prosecutions in major criminal matters. Some 19 major civil actions are currently before the court. There have been some 41 prosecutions of major criminal matters and three prosecutions of major civil actions. Obviously, this does not include far more numerous more minor matters.

         Clearly, some investigations are still under way involving activities in Western Australia. We await with interest the outcome of those investigations. The reality of the situation in the west indicates that the ASC is operating effectively. It is well respected by the business community there. Premier Court's utterances can be dismissed for what they are—the simple rantings of someone who goes on with state rights rhetoric on any issue. He just pulls out the next page. It does not matter what the heading is; he just goes on with exactly the same line. It is not supported by the users of the organisation in Western Australia.

As late as the last 24 hours, I have received an assurance from the Civil Aviation Authority that it is proceeding with absolute haste to guarantee that the remaining 20 recommendations—bringing it to 58, that is the total number of recommendations—are implemented by the end of June this year.

I think that is entirely appropriate. I will also await the outcome of the coronial inquiry, which will be conducted later on this year.

That represents 2,000 workplace agreements finalised before the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, and all of them finalised since October 1991. Indeed, this year the rate has picked up and half of those 2,000 agreements have been registered in the last 12 months. All told, federal agreement making now covers 45 per cent of all workers under the federal award system.

         The spread of enterprise agreement making in the federal system leaves the performance of the state systems absolutely for dead. Let me indicate to the House just how well we have performed in comparison with the states. In New South Wales all they have managed is 579 agreements covering 43,000 workers, that is, 11 per cent of all of the New South Wales workers covered under state awards. This is the much vaunted New South Wales system. We have achieved 45 per cent penetration; they are back at 11 per cent. Indeed, all of the independent studies of the quality of agreement making indicate that, by and large, federal agreements are the higher quality, high productivity outcomes as well.

We are particularly interested in looking at the non-union or lightly unionised sector. That was one of the principal purposes of the Industrial Relations Reform Act. Already in its first four weeks of operation we have seen the first agreements put forward. Indeed, we have seen agreements registered without union involvement in terms of the arrangements that prevailed up until this year.

         Until now, workplaces in Australia did not have the opportunities that they should have had to negotiate these flexible agreements. The new act allows that to happen while at the same time reinforcing the award safety net for those people fortunate enough to move into the enterprise bargaining stream. This revolution in the federal workplace—a revolution that will continue as a result of this year's act—has been achieved at a time when the opposition has contributed nothing except a long debate about whether Jobsback should be dumped along with Fightback and the GST.

         The fact is that the safety net that we provide through the social security system is the key instrument for poverty avoidance and alleviation in this country. Our system has been reformed and improved over the course of the 1980s and the 1990s. We now have a system which has been carefully studied and found to be highly effective and efficient at its poverty alleviation and avoidance objective, to the point that around 90 per cent in net terms of payments made through the social security system goes to people who would otherwise be in poverty.

         —The evidence is that major improvements have been made over the course of the last decade. For example, very substantial improvements in family payments and rental assistance have meant that payments to an unemployed couple with two dependent children under the age of 13 have doubled in real terms over that period. A sole parent with two dependent children renting privately at the beginning of this government's term of office was nine per cent below the poverty line. That person would now be four per cent above the poverty line. A single pensioner renting privately is now 15 per cent above the poverty line. Pensioners who own their own home are 49 per cent above the poverty line. A pensioner couple who own their own home are 62 per cent above the poverty line. In all these areas, there have been marked and major improvements against the Henderson poverty line, which itself has increased by 16 per cent over that period. So the increase in absolute terms is even more substantial against the increase in the Henderson poverty line.

         The most recent example of that is the opposition spokesman on foreign affairs, the honourable member for Kooyong, who called on the Prime Minister to intervene in the budget process to have Australia's overseas aid budget increased. In the last election he ran on a policy of reducing by $200 million over the next two years the amount devoted to Australia's foreign aid. He is one of those who appear to have been liberated so that one side of the opposition can perambulate about the place talking about the need for budget discipline and another section of the opposition can stand up and perorate on the need for more expenditure in particular areas.

         As it happens, of course, the public generally, and members of this House, will know what the government intends to devote to the area of foreign aid when the budget is announced, but I think it is worth pointing out these facts. Australia has a better record, in terms of the percentage of our GDP assigned to foreign aid, than the United Kingdom, Portugal, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Austria, Spain, New Zealand, the United States and Ireland. It is in pretty good company, looking through the bulk of those nations. There is a very substantial number of respectable countries among them, including some who are noted for a degree of generosity in the area of foreign aid, such as the United States and Japan; and the United Kingdom has not been regarded over time as niggardly.

         I might point out one or two other things about these nations. We have about 38 per cent of our GDP in the public sector. All of those nations which have a better performance in percentage GDP terms in foreign aid than Australia have much higher percentages of their GDP in the public sector. They include the Scandinavian countries. They do come up with very good figures on foreign aid—such as 0.7, 0.8 and one per cent of GDP—but, for example, something like 72 per cent of Sweden's GDP is in the public sector. It is obviously in a position where, devoted to government attention each time its budget is considered, there is a very considerable amount more resources available for disbursement for any particular purpose, including foreign aid.

         I do not think there is any country with a public sector the size of ours—and there are only about two with a public sector smaller than ours, including the United States and Japan—that does better on foreign aid. So what consideration there is of foreign aid in the budget needs to be contemplated against that background.

         I will go to the basis of your question on the better cities package that has been put in place to this point. The sorts of figures that you are talking about sound, off the top of my head, roughly of the appropriate dimensions. It has to be said that those propositions in the better cities program are basically aimed at ensuring that we optimise the use of public utilities to ensure that our cities, which have a very substantial tendency to spread expansively, have that process somewhat corrected. It is natural, in those circumstances, that where there are the greatest centres of population there is likely to be a strong tendency in the program to recognise them. I would have thought that the sorts of figures that the honourable member referred to, which were figures related to where the bulk of the Australian population lies, would be the sorts of areas that would be likely to pick up programs.

         I think that is a sad thing, because the Victorian parliament's own report into the construction industry flies in the face of the Victorian government's cooperation with the Commonwealth government over reform of the construction industry. That is the most disappointing aspect. So under the Commonwealth process—where we have the Construction Industry Development Agency—the Victorian government, along with other conservative governments, has seen the light and the need for cooperation in order to improve the construction industry. But not so the conservative elements of the Victorian parliament. That is the most objectionable part of the report that was handed down yesterday and, as I say, brought to my attention by the honourable member for Corio.

         One of the so-called important conclusions of the Victorian report is `the Victorian building and construction industry is critically divided on what the basic productivity objectives are and how to achieve such objectives.' That ignores the fact that there are dozens of enterprise agreements in the construction industry which themselves define productivity and which themselves have produced greater productivity in the construction industry. So the report is outdated and does not understand the sorts of processes that are taking place now between construction agents and the building unions.

         They appear to be unaware that, in the years between 1989 and 1992—for which we have figures—on the aspect of industrial disputes, for instance, an average of 38 days were lost on projects started in 1989 compared with 17.1 days lost for projects commenced in 1992. In a recent survey of 50 projects in the construction industry, 85 per cent of those projects met or bettered their cost targets. So here it is: the conservative elements of the Victorian parliament are at loggerheads with their own Victorian government, which has cooperated in our process in the reform of the construction industry, and have ignored the very practical processes of reform in that industry.

Having, along with many of my past colleagues, suffered under trial by innuendo and, since the corridors of this place's inside players have been all morning naming a certain person, that person is owed, in my opinion, a speedy and public denial by yourself. If, on the other hand, these allegations constitute, as they appear to do, a prima facie case of corruption at the highest levels, can the Attorney-General advise what were the quid pro quos for such generous, non-taxed fringe benefits? Further, if such is the case, can the Attorney-General assure the House that Mr X will be brought to judgment and given a fair trial—I might add, a courtesy he never extended to thousands of ordinary, working-class north Queenslanders?

It is true that there have been a number of media reports. It is also true that, as a result of a 1992 Auditor-General's report which was critical of the veterans compensation system, my predecessor, John Faulkner, commissioned an independent review by a committee chaired by Professor Peter Baume and assisted by Air Vice Marshal Richard Bomball AO and Ms Robyn Layton, an Adelaide QC. The committee was asked to consider the Auditor-General's report and the High Court case of Bushell. The committee reported to my predecessor on 18 March 1994.

         I turn to the assertions made on ABC radio in Queensland by the honourable member for Wide Bay, as mentioned by the honourable member for Lilley, and also to an article in his local newspaper headed, `Veterans' pensions may face government threat—Truss'. The honourable member for Wide Bay is not a bad fellow; he is quite a good fellow. But on this occasion he has been a very naughty boy. He is out there scaring an older section of our community by making people think they are going to lose entitlements which they will not lose.

That has occurred in the past and will occur in the future. In conclusion, I inform the House that any new initiatives arising from the government's response to the Baume report will not result in the reduction of any existing pensions.

        It has come to my attention over a period that members from the other side have asked very broad, generalised questions which have led to ministers announcing policy in their responses. As members of the opposition try to be vigilant in seeing that the standing orders are in fact enforced, how can we ensure that that particular standing order is enforced when, clearly, you are ruling that once the minister has started answering a question by announcing policy then obviously the question cannot be ruled out of order? Will you also consider being more vigilant in ensuring that questions are in order under that particular standing order?

         —This white paper reflects the collective concern of Australians and their collective ambition. Their concern for their fellow Australians, their ambition to make this a good society and a great and successful country. It is a statement about the two imperatives of a decent society—compassion and strength. About the bonds which exist between all Australians—and the premium this country places on the talent and energy of every individual. It is about the desire to extend the safety net and basic services which expand equality of opportunity and go to make a truly civilised society—and the ability to pay for them.

         Unemployment is without question the greatest problem we face. Unemployment saps the confidence and self-esteem of our fellow Australians—which in turn saps the nation's. It damages the social fabric. It has profound consequences for our social cohesion. As we have seen in other countries, ignored and neglected as a social problem, left to a fate to be decided solely by `market forces', unemployment threatens to create a permanent underclass. It threatens to create the conditions for social decay. We are not alone among nations in this—it is endemic to the Western developed countries. This government for one is determined to deal with the problem.

But success will not come easily: with this white paper we cannot say that the battle has been won, but we can say that it has been joined, and we sincerely hope not just by the Commonwealth government.

         The white paper is a statement of policy on employment and growth. It takes the view—the incontestable view—that economic growth is the key to employment growth. The evidence is very plainly there in this recovery—we have already seen 230,000 new jobs created in the past 12 months. That is why a substantial part of the white paper addresses itself to the means by which Australia can achieve higher levels of competitiveness. One of our great goals in these last years of the century must be economic efficiency, and the micro-economic reform and other measures described in this paper are no less important than the training, labour market and social security reforms.

         Australian business and industry will need to be increasingly flexible, innovative and responsive to customer needs. It will need these qualities to succeed in the increasingly competitive markets of the world. As these companies grow, jobs will grow with them.

         As the green paper indicated, even with strong economic growth, without intervention of the kind we have decided to undertake in this white paper, by mid-1998 there would still be some 290,000 people in the pool of long-term unemployed. This is not only profoundly unfair, it is profoundly inefficient. It is a waste of our greatest resource—the talent and energy of our people. Returning the long-term unemployed to the productive process of the nation not only returns them to the income, social interaction and creativity which work provides, it taps their potential for the good of Australia. As the white paper says, when we employ these otherwise wasted human resources we are made stronger.

         Large numbers of long-term unemployed people demand large outlays on social security and other assistance. Furthermore, having so many people effectively disqualified from the work force reduces the efficiency of the labour market. In this recovery the complement to skill formation in the labour market is not going to come from migration. This time it has to come from training our own people, including those who are presently unemployed.

         Central to the government's strategy for getting the long-term unemployed back into work is the job compact. The job compact puts new obligations on both the government and those receiving unemployment benefits. The government will provide to those who have been on unemployment benefits for 18 months or more individual case management, training and support and the offer of a job for six to 12 months. Individuals will be expected to take the job or lose their benefits.

         We will also introduce measures to identify people at risk of becoming long-term unemployed. Together with those who have been continuously unemployed for 12 months, these people will be given individual case management, including remedial action in such areas as literacy, numeracy, language and vocational training and access to relevant labour market programs. It is expected that over half a million people will receive individual case management each year.

         This is a radical program, a qualitative change in the way we approach labour market problems. The objective is to make long-term unemployed people ready for a job, and break forever the pattern in which the long-term unemployed become steadily more dispirited and unqualified for employment, while employers become steadily less inclined to consider them employable. In other words, the purpose of the job compact is principally to see that a substantial proportion of the new jobs in the recovery go to long-term unemployed Australians.

         A new training wage will be introduced to provide employers with extra incentives to hire long-term unemployed workers and invest in their training. The training wage encourages employers to provide training places in two ways. The award wage will be discounted for accredited training and the employer will receive a wage subsidy from the government at a level above what it would be if no training were involved. This represents a substantial incentive for employers to play their part in the national effort.

         An in-principle agreement on the training wage has been reached with a high level ACTU committee which will be recommending its adoption to the ACTU executive. The government will also be consulting with employers on the details of the training wage. To deliver case management and job placement services, the government will radically change the labour market by engaging community and private sector agencies. Job seekers will have a choice between these and the CES, with the competition between them regulated and encouraged by a new authority—the Employment Service Regulatory Agency, ESRA.

         As the white paper says, we are never going to return to a world where large numbers of full-time jobs are available  for unskilled young workers. As the keys to a successful modern economy are skills, ideas and innovation, the keys to employment are education and training. It cannot be stressed too much—in the modern economy skills are our greatest competitive advantage. Whether it is in global enterprises or local small businesses, it is on the ability of our people to add value that our standard of living depends. It is on skills that every individual's standard of living increasingly depends.

         The three principal elements of new government policy are: first, the government aims to encourage young people to stay in education and training by giving them appropriate financial support and more relevant courses run jointly by schools and industry. Second, we will be increasing the number and range of entry level training places for young people—by an estimated 50,000 by 1995-96. And thirdly, we will be introducing as a major policy change a youth training initiative for unemployed young people. The key to success is to provide help at an early stage in  the unemployment cycle, which means with the least possible delay after leaving school. The principal features of the youth training initiative are:

         Investing in skills of Australians, particularly young Australians, is the best investment we can make. This is recognised well beyond the realms of government. Industry is increasingly recognising it and increasingly indicating its desire to play a part. We are very well aware of industry's concerns about the relevance of current training and for this reason we are anxious to engage industry in both the design and delivery of courses. In future, Australian vocational training will be available through traineeships based in schools, TAFE, industry and labour market programs and will be available to adults as well. A training wage which offers a much simpler alternative to the multiple industry-specific rates currently applying will be available to employers who provide entry-level training.

         The social safety net was a term first used in the 1940s by Ben Chifley. He thought of it as the net under a trapeze artist, `to break the fall towards destitution and sustain a man and his family while they help him climb the ladder of opportunity again'. The basic principle of the safety net remains the same—and so does the basic necessity in a decent society to maintain it. But circumstances have changed and so must the way we design the net. The most fundamental difference is that no longer do families depend on the man alone to bring in the income.

         In general, the present social security system continues to assume that only one member of a couple, in most cases the husband, will be actively looking for work while the other will be a dependant. This ignores the increase in employment for women. It means that unemployed couples have not been encouraged to take advantage of the opportunities in the labour market. Over the last 10 years, the gap between income support for a married couple and income from lower paid jobs has also narrowed and the incentive to find work has been greatly diminished.

         There will also be a more generous income test for those who wish to combine parenting with paid work. By any measure, this is a major reform. The simplest measure is this—it will mean an extra $59 per week on average for nearly 120,000 low income families. The parenting allowance signals a new approach to income support based on the right of people to be paid as individuals, rather than as dependent partners. In this, and in the fact that it constitutes greater recognition of women's role in the work force and the growth in part-time and casual employment, the parenting allowance is consistent with the changes to income testing.

These reforms and initiatives necessarily depend on continuing economic growth. They depend on the ability of Australian enterprise to flourish and carve out a future in the world economy and especially the Asia-Pacific.

         A hundred years ago, the Australian colonies federated into a nation which numbered among its watchwords `the social laboratory of the world'. The Australia of a hundred years ago prided itself on advanced social policy. Just 50 years ago, with the white paper on full employment, another Australian Labor government codified and consolidated social policies which together formed the basis of the Australian social welfare system. That was a document of its times—in some essential ways, a much more modest document than this one. This white paper is a document for these times.

We should be proud that we now compete in areas we once thought beyond our capacity.

It detracts from democracy and the efficacy of members being able to fulfil their responsibilities. I accept the motion only because there have been discussions with my colleague. It would seem that the government is intent on preserving what I see as a ridiculous modification to the sessional orders to the disadvantage of this institution.

         The reality is that over the last five or six years the administration of aviation in Australia has become an absolute disaster zone. To give the House an indication of just how bad things are becoming, not only in the operations but in the administration, I will quote from the minister himself. He was asked a question in the Senate a few weeks ago and gave this answer on 14 March. The question concerned how many accidents and incidents had been reported in Australia in the three-year period to the end of November 1993. The minister answered that 10,000 accidents and incidents were reported in Australia for the three-year period to the end of November 1993.

         While it is true that some of them would not be regarded as major issues, the facts of the matter are that the second and third tiers of aircraft operation in Australia are areas of very great concern. In the 12 months from November 1990 to November 1991, 24 accidents were classified in category 2—namely, regional airline operations—and 22 incidents. From November 1991 to November 1992, there were 20 accidents and 10 incidents. From November 1992 to November 1993, there were seven accidents and one incident. Thank goodness that there have been no category 1 disasters and that our major carriers at least have a very safe level of operation.

We remember the tremendous efforts of Senator MacGibbon in the other place and the honourable member for Throsby (Mr Hollis) here in making sure that that was all exposed. Hundreds of thousands of dollars were wasted by the Civil Aviation Authority because it had to go back and redo the whole radar contract system.

         on Friday, 29 April 1994. The headline read `Row erupts over air safety'. Two different departments—the Civil Aviation Authority and the Bureau of Air Safety Investigation—had a go at each other because they disagreed with the violations of controlled airspace over a five-year period. BASI brought to everyone's attention the real dangers that were starting to exist in air space management. As usual, the CAA said, `Everything will probably be all right.'

         We have been through another situation. The department has insisted—probably rightly so—that beacons be installed in all operating aircraft. A row then developed as to what sort of beacon it should be. They should have been in place by now, but, once again, because of the dithering of this government, that project has been delayed. We will not see the introduction of those beacons until the middle of this year. It does not matter where you look in all the rows about safety, people are concerned at the obvious decline in safety standards in Australian aviation.

         On 28 April, a report from Australian Associated Press indicated that a Worksafe report had found that proposed changes to work hours for pilots might compromise pilot and passenger safety. The Australian International Pilots Association, one of the most responsible unions in the aviation industry, released a summary of the report which it will use to argue against a Civil Aviation Authority proposal to increase the maximum duty period for flight crews from 16 to 22 hours per day.

         The association is concerned that there is no other country that has those particular provisions. For some reason the Civil Aviation Authority has decided that they should be examined as a real proposition. The government is yet to make a determination on what is going to happen there. I think one of the great tragedies is that, while we can still proudly boast one of the safest aviation systems in the world, the plain fact is that it has been more and more challenged. It is being challenged because we have seen a decline in the capacity of governments and departments to administer safety standards in Australia.

The General Aviation Association and the airports people are all saying that it is physically impossible to make an appointment to discuss these matters of great moment with this particular minister. In the meantime we have a Civil Aviation Authority that has been charged with raising so much revenue that it would almost seem that that is its prime responsibility rather than determining the safety standards and regulations of Australia. We do have some very dedicated and very good people in those departments, but they are frustrated now to the point where the morale in the Civil Aviation Authority is at an absolute low.

Let us look at the operations of the Federal Airports Corporation. I was fascinated in the white paper from the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to see that we got a one line mention. The one line mention is the allocation of $73 million for some work to be done on the Badgerys Creek airport west of Sydney in the financial years 1995-96 and 1996-97. It is hoped that it might all be finished by then.

Of course, they were absolutely right. But does the minister honestly believe that the present allocations plus these additional allocations that have come in on this white paper have the capacity to present a full international facility for the people of western Sydney? The answer is obviously no. If I were the honourable member for Werriwa, after my commitment to making sure we were going to get the development of Badgerys Creek airport, I probably would have to go outside this place and either resign my seat or slash my wrists as a result of those statements in the government white paper.

There is some magnificent stuff going on there. At the moment we have a fight going on between Qantas and Ansett. The government, in its wisdom, decided to introduce a second carrier on international rights. Quite properly, the IASC awarded Ansett a number of international services. It is picking up the Osaka service and the Hong Kong service, and it is operating the Bali service. But it has rights to Malaysia—a huge source of tourism to Australia—that it is not going to pick up, and it is not going to pick up its rights over the New Zealand route. Qantas has rights that it has not used. On many of these services we have been asked to provide more capacity because the full development of Australian tourism is being wound down because of the lack of availability of seats on those routes at certain times of the year.

He commented upon debates earlier in the House today, he dealt with the International Air Services Commission and the question of Ansett flights to Bali and non-flights to Malaysia, and the fact that it is not taking up all the rights awarded to it.

I was pleased to obtain that assurance. We were able to talk further and to discuss this very question raised in the last few weeks about the circumstances in which a DC3 aircraft was allowed to take off—it did not get very far—and fly for seven hours across the Tasman Sea carrying no fewer than 25 people, the majority being the children who comprise the Scots College school band.

         If it is true, as has been suggested in press reports, that had that aircraft been built after 1963 it would not have been allowed to undertake that flight, I think there is something seriously wrong with the regulations. I have asked General Gration to make sure that that is addressed as a matter of absolute urgency. Let us not wait for any BASI inquiries into that crash; let us get on and tackle it now.

         In respect of the matters that have been of great concern to the honourable member for Hume (Mr Sharp), there is one big issue that I think requires attention over and above what we know of the circumstances of the accident to date—that is, the question of companies which might be in some financial difficulties, and whether there should not be a system of credit watch adopted by the Civil Aviation Authority where it is on a sort of red alert, as it were, to pay particular attention to companies that are fairly close to that viability line. I am not sure how we would go about that, but it is one of the things that I have asked General Gration to pay particular attention to, and I am hopeful that we can devise a system that will allow a lot more attention to be paid to airlines that fly in the future whose financial circumstances are similar to those sad days leading to the awful disaster of Monarch's aeroplane in June last year.

But I will not go out and pre-judge these issues. I know that, in the emotion of the moment when a member is representing an electorate where people have been touched by a great tragedy; where a community has been enormously affected by an accident such as the King Air, there is a tendency to race out and say, `This one is to blame and that one is to blame.' I will not be in on that. What I will do is pursue recommendations as they come from the appropriate authorities to make sure it cannot happen again and to make sure that, if those recommendations suggest that actions of a criminal or disciplinary nature should be taken against particular officers, that is pursued and pursued with all vigour. But I will not come out and act as judge, jury and executioner in this process. That will be for the proper authorities. But I will be—and this government will be—the facilitator of making sure that attention is paid by those authorities to all these issues.

         The fact is that the opposition has been at sixes and sevens about the question of the powers of the Civil Aviation Authority. There is no better way of illustrating that than to look at the various quotations of the honourable member for Fadden or, alternatively, the honourable member for Hume or, going to the other place, none other than our friend Senator MacGibbon. If honourable members read the things they have said—and I have had a chance to do so—they will see that they take a very different attitude as to how the Civil Aviation Authority should pursue its role.

         —I was interested to hear the remarks of the Minister for Transport (Mr Brereton) both in this matter of public importance and in question time earlier today. His response was interesting. For example, he mentioned the viability or credit watch of the airlines around Australia that provide a service to the travelling public. I think this is a critical issue. Had it been in place in Australia, as it is in the UK or the US, Monarch simply would not have been operating much beyond 1991, for the simple reason that Monarch was technically bankrupt at the time. The importance of this, which is learnt from investigating incidents such as the Monarch crash, is that, if an airline is not operating profitably, the first thing it does is cut corners. The corners that it cuts involve things such as maintenance and flying operation procedures. In my view, that ultimately helped contribute to the tragic loss of those seven lives at Young on 11 June last year.

         I was also interested to hear that the minister will pursue this matter as far as he possibly can. I was very pleased to hear that. But I will give the minister a little bit of an idea of the tiger that he will have to wrestle with. Over the years the CAA has run quite out of control. I have many examples of this, and I will talk about a couple of them today. The Monarch accident is one. This airline was technically bankrupt. The aircraft were not being properly maintained. Indeed, the aircraft that crashed had had the autopilot removed and several vital instruments had been made inoperable.

         I can highlight other instances. I draw to the attention of the House the incident involving Western Airlines that operated out of Wagga. That airline was a standing joke, particularly in Canberra. The joke was that, when a Western Airlines aircraft pulled up, drip trays had to be put under the aircraft to stop the oil spilling all over the apron. In Wagga the airworthiness inspector proposed to his senior managers in the CAA that that airline have its AOC, air operator's certificate, withdrawn and that the aircraft be grounded. Do honourable members know what ended up happening? The senior managers did investigate the claims made by the airworthiness inspector. They were all found to be correct. But, instead of punishing Western Airlines, they punished the airworthiness inspector. He was sidelined. His career is now doomed. But Western Airlines continues to fly. That is the sort of attitude that prevails within the Civil Aviation Authority.

         Let me give another example. Seaview Lord Howe Island Pty Ltd operates a Navaho that flies between Norfolk Island and Lord Howe Island. The Navaho can take nine passengers but, because of the length of the strip at Lord Howe Island and the 480-odd nautical miles that has to be flown between the two places, this Navaho is licensed to carry only six passengers because it has to carry a full load of fuel, taking off on a short runway.

The end result was that the chief pilot was sacked by the airline. The airworthiness inspector recommended that the aircraft and the airline be grounded. What happened? The airline continued to fly.

It was also breaking the law because life vests and life rafts were not carried when aircraft were flying over water.

         I have many other examples. I have a list as long as your arm that I could have given yesterday in my speech, but I am afraid that time did not permit me to do so. There are other examples of things going on in the Civil Aviation Authority that should concern the minister. Yesterday I mentioned the possibility of corruption. I cited the instance of flying operations inspectors, who are pilots, who are able to finesse a problem that air operators have on the basis and the understanding that, if they do it, there is plenty of free flying time for them in that airline company's aircraft. This has been suggested. I cited a particular example of it yesterday. But there are more problems than that.

         There is another activity that occurs with flying operations inspectors and it is called line flying: the CAA's flying operations inspectors fly with airlines. This is designed to give those pilots who work for the CAA flying experience to keep their licences up to scratch, and it also saves the CAA money. But many of those flying operations inspectors are abusing that system. One inspector in particular dons the uniform of one particular airline and flies every fortnight. As a result of this the people who are supposed to be administering, regulating or policing the law—whichever way we want to describe it—are working with and alongside the people that they are supposed to be regulating, resulting in a club-like matey arrangement. That is part of the problem because it is the flying operations inspectors who are overriding the recommendations of the airworthiness inspectors.

         Let me give another example. A CAA district officer recommended to the Director of Public Prosecutions that a particular airline operator be charged. The Director of Public Prosecutions looked into the matter and found that a prima facie case existed, so charges were laid. A flying operations officer based here in Canberra, who was at the time acting in what is described as a very senior position, intervened in this matter, spoke to the officer in charge of that district office where the original complaints had come from and demanded that those complaints be withdrawn. However, the DPP had taken those complaints to the point where they could not be withdrawn. But had that flying operations officer been successful, that case would never have gone forward. As it was the case did go forward and the air operator was found guilty of the charge. That would never have happened if that flying operations officer based here in Canberra had had his way. There is something awfully wrong with the way the Civil Aviation Authority is operating. If the minister is going to do what he says he is going to do, he has a big task ahead of him.

         There is another critical aspect to all of this which the Monarch Air crash and another crash that took place in Victoria down near Seymour two years ago highlight—that is, the matter of insurance. People are staggered when they realise that insurance for these types of airlines is not compulsory; it is an optional extra. That is absolutely wrong. I guarantee that all passengers who get in commercial airline aircraft in Australia would believe they are properly insured, but it is not the case. Many of the third level airlines do insure even though it is not required. But even if they do, as was the case in Victoria and has now proven to be the case with Monarch Air, the insurance company claims immediately there was a breach of the Air Navigation Act therefore the policy is voided, therefore there is no liability, and therefore there is no insurance for the victims' families. That is usually what happens.

         But if the insurance companies do not do that and they do pay out, there is a maximum payout of up to $180,000. If the Minister for Transport were driving his car, had a crash and was made a quadriplegic, he would expect to get $3 million or $4 million in compensation. But if the minister were flying in one of these aircraft, it crashed and he was made a quadriplegic, he could expect to get only up to $180,000—that is, if the insurance company ever paid up. That is downright unfair. It is inequitable and it has to be addressed. What the minister also has to do in the months ahead of him, as he fulfils the promise that he has given this House today, is to fix the problems of the Civil Aviation Authority and the aviation industry here in Australia.

         The starting point in this debate has to be the issue of general air safety in Australia. At the top level is the question of world envy of the fact that Australia has such an excellent air safety record, particularly with regard to the major commercial airlines and the major passenger traffic. There are lots of reasons for that, not the least being the very heavy and intense effort put in over many years by the Civil Aviation Authority and its predecessors requiring those standards, and the requirements instituted under the old two-airline agreement.

         Following the opening up of aviation to competition, and in this current climate of user pays and more and more intense pressure on the dollar in all industries, there are many more planes flying than was the case in the past. They are flying on much tighter margins and governments are under pressure from the industry, from taxpayers, from everyone, to minimise the bureaucratic costs involved with regulation and supervision. At the same time operators are under cost pressures that can lead to short cuts. Those short cuts can often be in the field of safety.

         There is nothing in the performance of the airlines or the statistics to date that gives us any reason to believe that this situation is any worse than it has been in the past. But that is not to say that we should not be seriously cognisant of it. I have to say to the honourable members for Hume and Fadden that in the kinds of policies they were coming forward with at the last election there was one little policy complication they got themselves into and have not yet, at this point anyway, jettisoned. In their Fightback proposals they were proposing that this industry bear the full cost of air safety charges: in other words, total user pays.

         The government maintains a regime whereby we finance the operations of the CAA in the field, and there is a subsidy involved because we believe in our commitment. Had that policy come into effect not only would the opposition have been adding a GST to the airline prices but it would also have been removing some of the assistance that is given in a financial way to the supervision of safety; in other words, there would have been a further direct squeeze on this issue of air safety. It is a little puzzling that too much is made of this issue in that context.

We came into this place together. He's very articulate and he delivers his views, but he is prone to stretch the point a bit and in fact is not always absolutely accurate.' That is a nice way to put it. On the radio this morning in respect of the Monarch incident—and I fully understand his close interest in and concern about this matter—I heard him say, `Here it is. It happened all this time ago and nothing has happened.' I do not believe that he really thought that nothing had been done. I hope that he is reassured by the answer given in question time today by the minister, who indicated that there has been extensive investigation undertaken in respect of that accident and there are a number of recommendations being brought forward right now. It is not true to publicly paint a picture that it happened and has been ignored or forgotten.

         It is also fair to say that the government shares some of the concerns about the capacity of the CAA, in the form that it was in, to deal with this air safety issue. That is why significant action has been taken to provide some restructuring and some separation of issues, such as the airworthiness section and the licensing section. It is my understanding that the structural changes that bring about those separations are already in place. If that is so, the honourable member for Hume was giving examples on radio this morning and again in this parliament about practices that no longer exist. They are colourful illustrations of the point, but the point needs to be made that they are no longer in existence. So, to the extent that that is the case, it is worth my making that point.

He has a track record of getting things done, and he has put this matter at the top of his priority list. I think we can expect some very prompt implementation of changes or assurances that a number of these matters that may cause concern are being and will be addressed.

         Having said those things, let me flag in this discussion something about which I think we all have to do some thinking. While we may have had these wonderful safety procedures and records, the fact of the matter is that flying around Australia is not all that difficult by world standards. It is basically a flat country and most of the major airports are on flat land near the seaboard. Whether it is by good management, good luck, good geography or whatever, we have enjoyed an enviable safety record, and the world acknowledges that. But the number of aircraft flying around in the skies over Australia is increasing. With population shifts and increasing wealth, lots of changes are taking place in commuter patterns and the pressure on airports is increasing. It is incumbent upon government and the industry to ensure that the infrastructure and the standards are in place, be they improvements in airports, in air traffic control, in training of the people involved or a higher degree of safety and responsibility on the part of the operators.

         I happened to be in south-west Tasmania last week and I flew back from a remote airfield to Hobart airport. As we approached the airfield, I had headphones on and was listening to the air traffic discussion between my pilot and air traffic controllers. As we were flying over Hobart, there were several aircraft in the sky. The pilot was told where they were and to keep his eye out for them. He was looking around everywhere, and so was I.

         However, the point is that maybe that is not satisfactory over time. Perhaps relying on pilots doing visuals under 3,000 feet will not be satisfactory in time, particularly if the equipment in the aircraft is not up to that. I think a lot of work needs to be done, as there are more and more of these aircraft flying around, to ensure that these standards are developed and maintained. I do not think the MPI is of substance, but I am happy to make that contribution.

          —On behalf of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, I present the second and third reports of the committee for 1994 relating to the refurbishment of the Australian Federal Police College, Barton, Australian Capital Territory, and the relocation of the Salisbury explosive ordnance testing facilities to Port Wakefield, South Australia.

          —by leave—I thank the House. The first report which I have tabled deals with the refurbishment of the Australian Federal Police College, Barton, Australian Capital Territory. The report recommends that the refurbishment should proceed, although there is a condition attached to this recommendation which I will explain later. The estimated cost of the proposed refurbishment is $10.5 million at July 1993 prices.

          The report mentions that the existing college building, although partially extended and later renovated, is nearly 50 years old and the standard of living-in accommodation and training facilities reflects this. If the Australian Federal Police is to have adequate facilities for the training of police officers and officers from other agencies, there is a definite requirement for better facilities.

          The AFP examined a number of options, including the use of a surplus school and the integration of the college with a new AFP headquarters. Neither option proved practicable or financially realistic. Accordingly, the AFP proposes to upgrade the building to comply with current regulations, fire safety and occupational health and safety; establish clearly defined functional zones and refine circulation and access routes within the complex; utilise existing courtyards more imaginatively; and upgrade the quality of work and residential areas.

          The committee's report concludes that the extent of the proposed refurbishment is necessary due to the age and condition of the building and a requirement to provide a modern, integrated training establishment offering facilities consistent with contemporary standards and expectations. Therefore, the standard of accommodation proposed is consistent with a need to cater for the diversity of personnel attending training courses. Similarly, the extent of the proposed upgrading of building services reflects the requirement to repair and maintain deficiencies in existing systems and to modernise them, where necessary.

          The committee has made recommendations concerning a number of design and consultative matters. On the question of fire safety, the committee recommends that the involvement of the ACT Fire Brigade should continue throughout the design and delivery of the completed project. The committee also recommends that an energy audit of the college should be carried out 12 months after completion of the project. The committee recommends that the Australian Council for the Rehabilitation of the Disabled should be involved in the design of refurbishment work relating to access and other facilities for the disabled. The committee recommends that the AFP should formalise arrangements with child-care centres aimed at providing certainty about the availability of child-care places.

          I said at the outset that the committee's recommendation that the work should proceed is conditional. This conditional approval stems from the impact of the law enforcement review, now completed, on the structure and functions of Commonwealth law enforcement agencies. The review had not been finalised at the time of the committee's consideration of the proposed work. We were very conscious of a case where a completed work previously examined by the committee was not required as a consequence of organisational changes occurring during construction. I am sure that the parliament would not wish to see a repeat of this type of debacle. The committee therefore recommends that the project should proceed, subject to impacts associated with the law enforcement review having no significant bearing on the scope of the proposal.

          The second report which I have tabled deals with the partial relocation of the environmental test facility from its current location in the Defence Science and Technology Organisation complex at Salisbury to Port Wakefield, north of Adelaide.
          <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
           In this place we all understand stress; indeed, it is an occupational hazard for us. But, for the benefit of honourable members, I will try to explain what environmental stress testing is all about. It involves subjecting items of ordnance to a variety of tests which simulate their handling, transport and storage. At present, this testing is carried out at Salisbury. The transportation of environmentally stressed ordnance from Salisbury to the proof and experimental establishment at Port Wakefield poses risks to the public and Defence personnel which could be avoided.

          The scope of the proposed work examined by the committee involves the construction of 12 test laboratory buildings, control and administrative buildings, four storage magazines and associated infrastructure. The estimated cost of the proposed work is $8 million. The committee has recommended that the proposal proceed. In arriving at this recommendation, the committee considered that environmental stress testing of explosive ordnance is essential to ensure the safety of defence personnel required to transport it and to ultimately operate the weapons system.

          The committee also concluded that there is a need for the stress testing to be undertaken at a safer location, preferably in close proximity to a proofing range. Defence examined a number of possible locations and concluded that Port Wakefield is the best one. I must say that, having inspected the proof and experimental establishment there, the committee agreed with this assessment. The committee concluded that the extent of the proposed work could be justified on the basis of the specialised functions which need to be carried out by or in the various buildings proposed.

          The committee sought assurances from Defence on a number of safety and environmental issues. The committee was assured that the location and size of the proposed site provides adequate clearance and room for expansion. Preliminary engineering investigations have indicated that the site is suitable for constructing the buildings proposed. There will be no significant deleterious environmental impacts from the proposed facility. There will be no additional firing and associated noise from the proof and experimental establishment as a consequence of the relocation of the ordnance environmental stress facility to Port Wakefield.

          Again, the committee sought assurances about the long-term viability of the proposed facility in the light of possible future policy changes. Based on the evidence presented to it, the committee concluded that, in the event of policy changes occurring in the future which may place the responsibility for all or some environmental stress testing of ordnance on Australian manufacturers, need for and the use of the proposed facility will remain. In terms of revenue from testing ordnance, the committee concluded that provision of a new purpose-built facility will provide considerable scope for Defence to undertake additional commercial work without the need for additional staff.

          A feature of the construction of the new facility will be the involvement of army engineers as the primary construction agency. The decision to use army engineers was made on the basis of the relatively remote site, the benefits to be gained from training and value for money. Army engineers are presently involved in the construction of RAAF base Scherger, near Weipa in Queensland. From all reports that I have received, it is proving to be a very successful exercise.

          Finally, I mention that the proposal has considerable local government support and, indeed, strong support from the local federal member. The proof and experimental establishment has been at Port Wakefield since 1928 and considerable goodwill exists between civilian and military authorities there. I commend the report to the House.

          There are two issues currently before the House on the question of testing ordnance. The first is that there exists at Port Wakefield, which is at the top of the Gulf of St Vincent, a proof and experimental establishment. It has been there since 1928. The proof and experimental establishment is there simply so that all of the service arms of the Australian Defence Force can test ordnances by firing them down the gulf. It may seem a little odd that anyone should choose to fire from Port Wakefield down the gulf towards the city of Adelaide, but Port Wakefield is in fact located at least 90 kilometres from the city of Adelaide. Even though the proofing range takes up about 30 kilometres of that stretch, the simple reality is that the firing occurs there because the Gulf of St Vincent is unique in world terms.

        <para first-indent="16">
         <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
          The gulf is unique in world terms in that it has lengthy and wide, sandy beaches and a huge tidal movement so it is possible for the proof and experimental establishment to fire from its location just south of Port Wakefield down the east coast of the Gulf of St Vincent and to have the projectiles land in what will be about two metres of water. They will then safely and without sustaining damage sink to the bottom. The tide goes out and the proof and experimental people retrieve the projectile.

        <para first-indent="16">

          The whole object of the proof and experimental range is to be able to take that projectile and, having tested it with radars and having tested its trajectory, determine whether or not, since it has not been damaged in the landing process, it is distorted in any way as a result of the firing. This procedure has gone on since 1928. Since 1928 it has been possible for Defence to test its barrels, its shells, the shell casings and the projectiles in this manner. So successful has this testing been that we have now attracted work from around the globe.

          Naturally, the firing process in itself causes a good deal of noise and some angst to the local community. Many members of the community are accustomed to it as it has gone on since 1928. During World War II the range was extensively used and the extensive use of the range in wartime conditions, when there was an urgency for all types of tests to occur, meant that there were occasions when ordnances that ought to have exploded failed to explode on impact and so sat on the bottom of the beach.

          As a South Australian I must confess that the beaches now occupied by some unexploded ordnances resulting from World War II testing are beaches that South Australians would like to use for crayfishing. Just to the south of the range, in fact, there is quite a vigorous little crayfishing port called Parham. It simply will not be possible, I regret, for South Australians to occupy this east coast of the Gulf of St Vincent because since World War II there has been all of this extensive testing.

          The controversy that has erupted over the relocation of the Salisbury facility to Port Wakefield is that there are people who believe it will result in additional firings from Port Wakefield. I want to pick up the point made by the chairman when he said that the committee was assured that `there will be no additional firing and associated noise from the Proof and Experimental Establishment as a consequence of the relocation of the ordnance environmental stress test facility to Port Wakefield.'

          The ordnance environmental stress test facility—it may seem a little odd to have an environmental testing facility involved with munitions—is a facility that exists at Salisbury and will be relocated to Port Wakefield. Prior to its relocation, all of the testing done on ordnances in Salisbury were nothing more than environmental testing, hence the name. That is, the ordnances were either frozen or heated as the case may be. As the chairman and members of the committee and I witnessed, they are dropped off pallets to simulate what would happen if in the loading of a vessel, for example, the forklift or the pallet slipped and these munitions then fell onto the deck of the ship. Clearly it is in the interests of the Australian Defence Force and of all personnel that they explode in the barrel of a gun and not on the deck of a ship.

          This sort of test goes on and it goes on at Salisbury in what is now a metropolitan area. Having been tested at Salisbury, the ordnances are then carted to Port Wakefield for firing.

I just want to put on record in the parliament the simple reassurance that I offer those few people who have since become apprehensive about this work: there is no proposal, nor is there any need for additional firing from Port Wakefield.

I restate that the area is already, as it were, polluted by World War II firings. No pollution occurs now, since the projectile and the trajectory are always monitored when it is fired. Defence knows precisely where the projectile has landed. It can be marked on the map so it is easy to locate or at least Defence knows the general area where it is if it cannot be located. Currently, because we have guns that now fire over a much larger distance, some firing occurs from the west coast of the Gulf of St Vincent across to the east coast. I know that has caused some dislocation, some concern to Defence and some concern to my constituents over the past two weeks.

I am sure that no-one in the House enjoys having a debate disturbed, particularly over a three-hour period. However, I suppose when we consider that the debate is all about something that we on this side of the House are extremely proud of, it is fortuitous or symbolic that it was delayed to allow the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) to advise us of the nature of the white paper and its issues, which we on this side of the House will be proud of for a long time to come.

         At the time the debate was suspended I was in the middle of explaining why the child-care cash rebate is such a great initiative. This initiative will help families with the cost of child care associated with employment, training, education or job search. A feature of this support is that it will not be income tested. It will provide up to $61.20 per week for two or more children. Unlike a tax concession, the cash rebate is claimed as the cost is incurred rather than up to 18 months later. That is why it is fundamentally fairer than a tax concession. It does not favour high income earners.

         The cash rebate will make sure that women with low incomes also benefit, including women in part-time work or studying who have no taxable income. It will not force low income women unnecessarily into the work force. An estimated 230,000 families will benefit at a cost of $149 million a year over the next four years. The child-care rebate legislation which establishes the child-care cash rebate was not opposed by the opposition. I thank the opposition for that. I urge honourable members to support this current legislation, which will implement changes to the Human Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill so that the child-care cash rebate scheme can be administered by the Health Insurance Commission.

With 1994 being the International Year of the Family, such an initiative is indeed timely, giving added financial support to families. It is not only timely—it is indeed appropriate.

         —It gives me great pleasure also to speak to the Human Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill 1994. In doing so I support my colleagues the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson) and the honourable member for Paterson (Mr Horne). I was also very pleased to hear the honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan) say that some very good points are contained in this legislation. I commend her for those comments. But as is often the case, the honourable member for Moncrieff was rather selective in some of her comments. At one point the honourable member for Moncrieff actually claimed that she had been misrepresented by the honourable member for Moreton. I would like to take up that issue.

Back in 1993, on 20 October, the honourable member was the first person to speak for the coalition—therefore leading the coalition discussion—in demanding that a means test be imposed on the child-care cash rebate. She was, I reiterate, the first speaker from the coalition on this bill and therefore in the lead. I would like to quote a couple of passages from that speech on 20 October 1993. The honourable member for Moncrieff stated:

For many years there has been increasing community recognition of the expense and the inequity of open-ended government assistance and the desirability of targeting those in most need. The coalition believes that this approach would be an appalling misuse of scarce public resources and unnecessarily limits the capacity of government to provide adequate assistance to those in genuine need.

        We are talking about assisting those in genuine need. The amendments here that we are discussing today are largely, as we have heard, of a minor procedural nature. They provide for the recovery of costs incurred by the Commonwealth in the provision of rehabilitation programs. The amendments in section 23, as we have heard, will serve to strengthen legislative support for the recovery of costs by the Commonwealth for rehabilitation programs provided to clients with compensation. The bill further goes on to require decision makers under part 3 of the Disability Services Act to notify persons affected by their decisions of the making of those decisions and of the right of appeal.

         Part 3 of the bill relating to the Health Insurance Commission Act 1973 is consequential on the passage of the Child Care Rebate Act of 1993. The amendments will provide that, consistent with the existing scheme of operation of part 5 of the HIC Act 1973, part 5 makes adequate provision in relation to the child-care cash rebate functions of the commission. Part 5 of the Health Insurance Commission Act deals with financial matters. So accordingly the HIC will be required to prepare estimates of receipts and expected expenditures related to the performance of its child-care cash rebate functions; to expend its moneys in relation to those functions only in accordance with approved estimates of expenditure; to apportion its assets and expenditure appropriately and to open bank accounts required to enable it to properly handle its moneys.

         What is most noteworthy about this bill is that the Labor government has recognised that it is difficult for women to participate on an active basis in the workplace. We have had that come to our attention on many occasions. Women are often constrained by access to affordable child care. I reiterate here something that has been often stated by the women members of this parliament: women are over 50 per cent of the population and have a diversity of skills and abilities to offer which are extremely valuable to the economy. Yet, in many instances we are unable to make use of that incredible pool of knowledge. The limited access in the past to affordable child care has been part of the problem. The cash rebate will substantially increase the ability and the affordable opportunities of women who wish to work or undertake further education and/or participate in training programs.

         The child-care rebate forms part of the Labor government's child-care policy, which is an extremely comprehensive package that recognises that most parents, at some stage of their working lives, will require affordable access to quality child care. In 1983, when this government was elected, there were approximately 46,000 child-care places available. By the end of the 1993-94 financial year—10 years later—that will have increased to approximately 237,000 places. This government promised to meet all demand for work related child care by the year 2001. From the results to date, and with the implementation of the child-care rebate scheme on 1 July 1994, this promise is well on target.

         that the child-care rebate recognises that the cost of child care is a legitimate expense for parents earning an income. As with other expenses incurred when earning an income, it will not be means tested. The introduction of this scheme recognises at long last the costs that are borne by parents—I reiterate `parents'—and particularly mothers in earning an income. This bill recognises that all working families are entitled to some form of recompense for the cost of work related child care. However, to ensure that this recompense was equitable and that benefits flowed to lower income families, a decision was made to introduce a cash rebate so that families could claim as the expense was incurred.

         I will outline the main features of the child-care rebate scheme. The rebate will be payable by mail or in person through Medicare offices of the Health Insurance Commission with effect from 1 July 1994. The rebate will be available to parents who are employed, studying, training or looking for work. It will be paid for any work related child-care expenses for children under 13 years of age. After the first $16 of weekly child-care costs, families can claim 30 per cent of their costs up to a ceiling of $110 per week for one child in care and $220 per week for two or more. The maximum weekly rebate will be $28 per week for one child in care and $61.20 per week for two or more children in care. The rebate will be payable over and above child-care assistance and it will not be income tested. All work related child care in the formal child-care sector will be eligible—long-day care and occasional care centres, family day care, outside school hours care and vacation care.

         Informal child care is defined as child care that is not currently eligible for Commonwealth and/or state funding. It can be either in the child's home or in another person's home. In the informal child-care sector, carers have to be 18 years old or over. Parents are excluded from claiming for the cost of caring for their own children. Carers can be a child's stepbrother or stepsister or other relative. Informal carers must meet state or territory regulations relating to informal care where they apply. Eligible child-care expenses must be directly associated with the provision of work related care.

         To participate in the Commonwealth child-care cash rebate scheme, families will need to register with the Health Insurance Commission, and it is expected that that is now well under way. To be eligible to claim the rebate families will have to satisfy some criteria. The cash rebate will be available for child-care expenses for the care of children under 13 years of age incurred by families where both parents are engaged in one or more of the following: full-time or part-time work, study, training, or looking for work. In the case of sole parent families, only the custodial parent needs to meet one of these criteria.

         Families will be required to substantiate their work force status and the birth dates of the children they wish to register. Families will have the option of allowing the Health Insurance Commission to use Medicare enrolment details to verify birth dates of children. In order to be eligible for the cash rebate, families must be Australian residents as defined under the Social Security Act; that is, they must be Australian citizens, or have a valid entry permit, or a return endorsement, or a resident's return visa. Some categories of non-residents will also be eligible: Australian government sponsored overseas students and hardship cases. Registered families who meet these criteria will be able to claim the child-care cash rebate by presenting receipts for work related child-care expenses incurred with a registered child-care provider from 1 July 1994.

         The amendments to the Disability Services Act 1986 relate to the recovery of costs of rehabilitation programs provided by the Commonwealth Rehabilitation Service to persons eligible to receive compensation from other sources, such as insurers, for their injuries. Section 26 of the act relates to a client's right to have a decision reviewed by the secretary and to the right of appeal to the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. An amendment to section 23(5) brings the legislation into line with what has been common practice for many years. It has been the practice to serve notices in relation to the recovery of rehabilitation costs on insurers prior to the settlement of litigation between the insurer and the insured person, on the basis that the insurer is `the person liable to pay compensation' referred to in the act. It is accepted that no payment would be received until a court case had been settled.

         Legal advice indicates that, under section 23(5) of the act, notices should not be served until it has been determined by a court, or by agreement between the parties, that the insurer is liable to pay compensation. The Attorney-General's Department has been consulted and its advice supports the need for legislative amendment. If notices were not sent early it would have a serious effect on the recovery of costs of programs provided and consequently on the revenue targets set for the CRS.

         An amendment to section 23(5) of the act will enable notices to be sent to insurers who are potentially liable to pay compensation well before the matter comes before a court or is settled between the parties. The second amendment to section 23 is to subsection (7) which presently requires an insurer not to pay any moneys awarded to the client until the amount owing for the rehabilitation program has been specified by the Commonwealth. It does not require the insurer to discharge the debt to the Commonwealth before paying the client.

         Difficulties are often created for the CRS when the insurer pays the client without regard to the sum owing to the Commonwealth and the CRS is obliged to seek to recover the amount owing from the client. It should be noted that even when the payment is received from the insurer, the client has the right to seek to be released from any liability and could, in special circumstances, have all or part of the moneys paid to the Commonwealth refunded. Advice from the department's legal branch supports the need for a change, and the amendment requires payment of the debt to the Commonwealth before paying the remaining award moneys to the client.

This would bring the act into line with the requirement in a recent amendment to section 27A of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal Act 1975 which requires advice of appeal rights against reviewable decisions to be given in writing, and defines reviewable decisions to include decisions reviewable by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal and those taken in an internal review procedure.

         The new cash rebate system is a major part of this bill. For the people of Gilmore, the people who I represent, I would like to put it in these terms: the Commonwealth child-care cash rebate will cut child-care costs for working families. Around 230,000 families with about 350,000 children in informal and formal child care are expected to benefit from this new non-means tested payment. From 1 July this year, parents using child care while working, training, studying or looking for a job will be eligible for a 30 per cent rebate on the cost of child care. The rebate will be paid for all work related child-care expenses for children under 13.

         The cost of child care is a legitimate expense for parents. Unlike other concessions for expenses incurred in earning an income, the new child-care cash rebate will not be means tested. The introduction of this scheme marks an enormous change in our attitude towards child care. It recognises that child care is an important economic issue and not just a welfare issue. I will go further to suggest that it is not a women's issue; it is a family issue which relates to our whole population.

An amount of $61.20 per week, or around $3,182 each year, will be paid for two or more children. Families will pay the first $16 of weekly child-care costs and then be able to claim 30 per cent of their costs up to the fee ceiling of $110 per week for one child in care or $220 per week for two or more children. To ensure the payment of the rebate from 1 July, families and child-care providers are urged to register with Medicare by person or by mail as soon as possible.

         The improvements in child care that have been made by this government in its 10 years of office, the recognition that has been given to child care as a major issue in the employment and social spheres of Australian society and the reorganisation of society that has been taking place are truly amazing. The ability of a person of my age and generation to see my male and female contemporaries having more equal opportunities than perhaps my parents did is an indication of the changes that have taken place in Australian society. Those changes have allowed more egalitarianism and a more efficient and progressive use of the human resources in this country.

         Child care liberates women and enables them to reach their potential in the employment market if they so desire. Their being liberated and not tied to those targets requires financial backing, which comes from the provisions of the new child-care cash rebate scheme in the Human Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill. Its set-up through the use of the existing infrastructure—that is, Medicare, et cetera—is most appropriate. It avoids the duplication of infrastructure, which all too often happens, and bureaucracies, which may not be beneficial for the long-term economic efficiency of our community.

A certain woman I know wished to have significant time with her children, so instead of working five days a week she chose to work three days a week. Her remuneration was such that, after she had paid child care for the three days that she did work, she ended up with $150 a fortnight. These arrangements will substantially change that. I know about that example because that woman happens to be my wife.

The Human Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill 1994 is an omnibus bill that covers a number of amendments to various pieces of health and human services legislation. In particular, the amendments made by part III of the bill are consequential to the Childcare Rebate Act 1993. That act was another important step to ensure that child care is affordable for all working families. From 1 July this year parents using child care while in employment or while training, studying or looking for work will be able to claim a cash rebate for part of their child-care expenses.

         The Commonwealth cash rebate will be administered by the Health Insurance Commission on behalf of the Department of Human Services and Health, and the cash rebate will be payable by mail or in person through Medicare offices of the Health Insurance Commission.

         In my years as a member of the federal parliament, it is hard to remember a more popular initiative than the child-care cash rebate. This fulfils another promise that the government made during the election campaign. I have received hundreds of phone calls from constituents commending the government on this initiative. I think the opposition would be hard put to find one parent who did not believe that he or she needed this assistance. Even among the opposition, only one honourable member has stood in this House today to oppose the legislation, and I think that, in a sense, that might be voting with the constituents.

         It is unfortunate that opposition members are carping that this initiative should be income tested when in the same breath they are telling taxpayers that they want to introduce  income splitting so that well-to-do people earning over $100,000 a year can pay less tax. I do not know where they think there is any equity in that but, then again, faulty thinking is something that in recent years we have come to expect from the opposition on matters such as this. I think that opposition members know that few households with young children earn more than $100,000. In fact, according to the 1991 census, in my electorate parents earning more than $100,000 represented just 0.1 per cent—about 80 people.

         To give some examples of the circumstances in my electorate, recently the Rockdale Council, which covers part of my electorate and part of the electorate of the honourable member for Barton (Mr Punch), completed a demographic survey of the municipality. Some very interesting results came out of that, and I would like to share them with the House this evening. Of the 30,400 households, families make up 70 per  cent, and 70 per cent of the families have dependent children. Of those households with dependent children, 6.9 per cent are lone parents and, of those working parents with dependent children, 73 per cent employ the full-time use of child care in one form or another.

         However, it should be noted that Rockdale is a rather settled area, and the figures would be relatively low compared with other parts of my electorate. Nearly one quarter of the people who live in Rockdale live alone or are elderly. In the adjacent Hurstville and Canterbury local government areas, for which I have not got any figures available at present, I will hazard a guess that the number of young families with dependent children would be twice the number of Rockdale. There is no doubt in my mind that working families with children are a very significant proportion of our society. I believe, and the government believes, that they deserve the very best we can provide in this, the International Year of the Family. That is what they are receiving from this government—assistance where they need it and when they need it. It is a pity that the opposition cannot join with us in totally supporting this very worthwhile initiative.

         Another important aspect of this initiative is the recognition of the informal child care sector. In the past, things such as fee relief—which I will go into shortly—were available for people in the formal child care area. But for the first time this legislation takes account of the fact that a large number of people have their children cared for by family members or friends. The government is taking account of that and providing assistance in that area. I think that the overwhelmingly larger part of the provision of child care is in that informal area.

         The government's record on the provision of child care is unequalled, with record growth in the number of places—increasing from 46,000 when we came to office to 257,000 by June this year—and our interim target will be 300,000 places by 1996-97. Nevertheless, that still does not provide enough assistance in the informal child care area. As I said earlier, for the first time—and only under a Labor government—the child-care cash rebate acknowledges the work of neighbourhood baby-sitters and of grandparents. This aspect alone is a very big leap forward in assisting working parents and ensuring the provision of child care for them.

         It is very interesting to note what one might say is the malappropriation of child-care services in Australia; that those parents who come from middle class areas tend to have far greater access to the formal child-care system of preschools, nurseries, family day care, et cetera. For people in working class electorates, who by dint of economic circumstances in many cases have to make a decision for both parents to work, there is far less access to a variety of child-care provisions.

         It used to gall me in the past to see those middle class areas in my city of Sydney having a disproportionate amount of child-care centres and people in working class electorates such as mine—particularly the very working class areas of my electorate such as Campsie and Lakemba—having access to mostly family day care, neighbourhood friends or relations. With family day care, people got some assistance but, if people had their children being minded in the informal area, there was no assistance at all. I think one of the great provisions of this piece of legislation is a mechanism to allow us to pay people in the informal sector.

         The government has never been content to rest on its laurels. In addition to the child-care cash rebate, which we are dealing with in this legislation, we have already introduced a home child-care allowance. Today, as announced by the Prime Minister (Mr Keating) in the white paper on employment and growth, we will be introducing a new parenting allowance. The parenting allowance will provide payment to one parent free of any obligation to seek work. There will be a more generous income test if the person chooses to combine parenting with paid work. It will mean an extra $59 a week for over 120,000 parents. I think that is something that members of the government and the Prime Minister himself, who has taken a very close interest in this area, can be very proud of. I hope that the opposition, in its response to the white paper later on in the week, will show some decency and embrace at least this portion of the white paper.

         This allowance will be paid at the maximum of $132.65 per week when the recipient's income is less than $231 per week, reducing to $30 per week when the partner's income exceeds $378 per week. The home child-care allowance, scheduled for introduction in September this year, will be incorporated into the parenting allowance from July 1995. This will mean that the person receiving the parenting allowance will retain a $30 per week non-taxable payment irrespective of his or her partner's income. This allowance, along with other changes to the payment of social security benefits, including the partner allowance, recognises the right of individuals to be paid.

         In introducing these initiatives which focus on families, the government is recognising that Australia's most valuable resource for the future development of both our economy and our society is our children. Ensuring that our children receive quality care at the beginning of their lives is one of the major priorities of the government. When that is coupled with the government's support for schooling and training after schooling, it shows that the government believes that we should be giving particularly low income families the best chance we can.

In 1983, when we came to office, there were 46,000 operational child-care places. There are now more than 220,000 child-care places, which is an increase of 478 per cent. We reached the figure of 220,000 in December last year. The 1993-94 budget provided for the provision of 31,000 new places, bringing the total number of places that we hope to provide by the end of this financial year to just under 240,000.

Health is not a product; it is a human right.

         Honourable members will be aware that I am here because I defeated the opposition spokesman on health in the seat of Lowe. Health was a major issue. I can assure the House that the fear of the health provisions of Fightback was very real and very widespread. Women especially were concerned that the opposition would in fact have a worse system than it was actually promoting in Fightback. Why does the opposition still cling to this view that health is a product like Coca-Cola or jeans, a product to be sold to those who can buy and be denied to those who cannot? I know that the opposition said that this was not its policy, but I can tell honourable members that people, especially women, were convinced that this would be the real outcome of the opposition's health policies.

Now one may ask why should I be worried if the opposition insists on clinging to a health policy outlook that is poison at the ballot box. I am concerned because I see the genuine fear and worry of many men and women on low income levels at every election. They fear the result which would see Medicare dismantled and they fear the decline in their families' health from such an act. To remove such fear I would suggest that the opposition parties actually have a change of heart and embrace the public health system as exemplified by Medicare.

They want a decent standard of living where they do not have to worry that illness will crush them either financially or socially. We Australians are actually different people from others in the world who speak English. Our society is a serious success because of our peculiar avoidance of the pitfalls of class, race and religious bigotries. How this came about is a good question for historians. I will not pretend to know, but what I do know is that we are different because we look upon each other not as competitors for scarce resources but as cooperators in building a decent place to live. This smooth plain of cooperation is not perfectly smooth. Some Australians still see health and human services as a great field for profit and enrichment.

         But clearly we have a situation where child care has gone to two different categories: people who have been needing more facilities and people who have been needing child care not only for employment but for the seeking of employment. Clearly there has been a great need to see a financial commitment by the government to those who pay for child care. Of course, there was the previous situation where people were able to get child care allowances that were means tested. For people who had been using other means of child care, be they private arrangements, nannies, grandparents, et cetera, there was a difference that had to be met. Clearly we now have a situation where the government has met this need by bringing in the new child-care arrangements.

As many members are aware, the AIDS epidemic is spreading across the world. Scientists are losing hope that an effective vaccine will be developed in the foreseeable future. In some African cities one in three of the population is HIV positive. Blood can only be accepted from primary school children. The World Health Organisation estimates that 45 million people will be HIV positive within six years. In Europe and America there are signs that the disease is spreading, especially among the poor. Around the world there are about 15 vaccines under development. However, it may not be possible to find one that protects against all of the strains of the virus.

In the same period, Thailand, with whom we expect to trade profitably, will see its life expectancy fall from 75 years in 1980 to 45 by 2010. To take the Thailand example further, child mortality rates are expected to rise more than fivefold over the current—

In Thailand, child mortality rates are expected to rise more than fivefold from the current 20 deaths per thousand born to 110 deaths per thousand born in the year 2010. Unfortunately, all the various international agencies agree on these shocking statistics. This is a matter of the gravest concern for Australia and the world. We would be well advised to take this epidemic very seriously and not delude ourselves that this is a matter that only affects a certain group of people and, therefore, the rest of us need not worry.

         This House has a serious moral duty to the nation to look at this problem in a totally scientific way and not to wrap itself up in smug self-righteous attitudes. Even if we limit ourselves to the most basic level of our economic ties to the rest of the world, I would remind the House that half the world's population in 1994 was to be found in just five countries: China, India, the United States of America, Brazil and Russia. These countries have a major problem with AIDS and not one of these countries is handling the epidemic very well at all. The capacity for destruction by AIDS is unparalleled in modern history. For example, in Brazil, Haiti, Thailand and 13 African countries, the AIDS epidemic will slow growth rates so dramatically that, by 2010, these countries will have 101 million fewer people than had been estimated in 1990.

         For those who smugly suggest that AIDS is just an epidemic amongst homosexual men, the Asian Development Bank has recently written that the AIDS epidemic in Asia will be a higher threat to women than to men. The epidemic is certain to have major socioeconomic implications for Asia and the Pacific. At present, more Asian men than women are infected with HIV. But there is strong evidence that social conditions in Asia, particularly south Asia, may lead to a trend where many more women become infected. The reasons for expected rising infections among women are biological factors: frequent births, which may require blood transfusions; and the low status of women, which inhibits them from acquiring the means to protect themselves from AIDS.

         In Australia the situation is a lot better than in any other country. Proper scientific approaches to the problem have existed from the beginning. Adequate education, funding and community concern have resulted in a serious assault on this epidemic. Many people are to be thanked for this timely and, so far, successful campaign. The typical, sensible, bipartisan Australian approach has paid off and I, for one, am most anxious to see that this continues.

I would urge all members to take such an opportunity to acquaint themselves with the most up-to-date intelligence on this medical and social catastrophe. Australians have a proud record in medical matters. Our predecessor parliaments have always been supporters of medical research, be it for polio, diphtheria or any other communicable disease. I am confident that this 37th parliament can be worthy of its forebears and stay up to the mark on this epidemic of AIDS for as long as necessary. I commend the bill to the House.

         —in reply—I thank all honourable members who have spoken on the Human Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill. We have certainly had a very wide ranging and interesting debate. We have heard from the honourable member for Moncrieff (Mrs Sullivan), the honourable member for Moreton (Mr Gibson), the honourable member for Paterson (Mr Horne), the honourable member for Bass (Mrs Silvia Smith), the honourable member for Gilmore (Mr Knott), the honourable member for Watson (Mr Leo McLeay) and the honourable member for Lowe (Mrs Easson).

         We have also had the occurrence of a very unique event, in that in the middle of the debate—we started the debate in the early afternoon—we had the presentation before this parliament of one of the most revolutionary pieces of policy by any government for many years. I am referring to the white paper on employment, Working Nation. Elements of that paper affect the issues that have been discussed and, indeed, some of the questions raised by some of the speakers. I will refer to that later.

         Let me begin on one point made by the honourable member for Moncrieff. She made a number of points and she would be very disappointed if I did not respond to them. The first important point was, `Why isn't Dr Lawrence here to handle the legislation?' Obviously the honourable member for Moncrieff knows that I have responsibility within the government for legislation in the Department of Human Services and Health, and I have held that responsibility on behalf of a number of ministers.

         —The honourable member for Moncrieff obviously does not understand the way things operate. Perhaps she ought to go and study the system as it is operated. But the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) has approved the policies and the legislation, and the department has been involved scrupulously, with the very hard work of our officers, in putting forward the legislation. That point made by the honourable member for Moncrieff was a furphy. She was trying to raise the point as though the minister were not concerned with the issues involved here. The minister is very much concerned with the issues raised here in this bill and with issues that honourable members have raised, including those raised by the honourable member for Moncrieff. I refer to the issues of child care and the home child-care allowance.

         Some of my colleagues tried to reply to the issues raised by the honourable member for Moncrieff. She took a number of points of order and made a personal explanation because she did not consider that they had properly dealt with her arguments. She accused them of not referring to the right policy. But, of course, one of the problems we have with the opposition is that it appears to consider it is okay to means test some things but not others, without any rationale on its part whatever. I could not follow why she objected last year to the means testing of certain things and then objected when certain other things were not means tested. We seem to have some confusion on the part of the opposition as to this whole issue of what is to be means tested and what is not.

         Obviously, it would be good to have a general philosophical position on this, but that is a vain hope, given that the opposition as a whole has very little philosophical position on social issues. It needs to think through some issues. Maybe it could learn some things by talking to some of the conservative parties in other countries that have moved beyond the New Right Thatcherist ideas in economics and have tried to do something on social policy. The opposition might actually develop some social policy and we might be able to have a debate in this chamber.

         As the Leader of the House (Mr Beazley) mentioned during question time today, it is no good the opposition simply picking one little piece and saying, `You should spend more money on that or you should spend more money on another little policy' when its key economic spokespersons are saying, `Cut out billions of dollars, $5 billion, $6 billion or $7 billion, from the budget,' which essentially means the social budget. That is what it means and meant in the last election: the social budget. If the opposition were going to cut that money out of the social budget, it cannot come in here and demand all sorts of extra spending. That basically was the argument from the honourable member for Moncrieff. Her argument was that we should spend more money on the parent who is at home, whether the wife or the husband, and looking after the children.

         The balance between social justice and economic development is the key issue. That is what government is all about in the modern world: finding the right balance, not ignoring social priorities, drastically cutting things and creating an underclass as Mrs Thatcher did in Britain. The British people are still suffering years afterwards and will probably continue to suffer for many years into the future because of the lack of concern for social justice and social policy.

         The honourable member for Moncrieff talked about recognising the role of women or men at home. The government has issued a number of papers talking about the recognition of their role and has actually put into place the home child-care allowance. We had another interesting development today with the presentation of the white paper. What do we see in the white paper? We see a further development of this matter by the government with the introduction of the new parenting allowance, which will further support parents at home. What is most interesting is that this is a clear social justice measure. In particular, 120,000 low income families in Australia will receive an extra $59 a week on average.

Those opposite cannot have it both ways. The opposition might have dropped Fightback and it might have dropped all of its policies, but it will not be allowed to get away with the idea that it can talk about big cuts to the budget on the one hand and about social concern and social policies on the other.

         Why did the Leader of the Opposition (Dr Hewson) issue a statement attacking the central concept of the jobs compact the other day? He attacked that idea.

He did that because he recognised that if his party were in government it could not afford it. If one looks at the Fightback package, one will see that the coalition was going to significantly reduce spending in these areas. How then would the unemployed, especially the long-term unemployed, have been able to benefit?

         When talking about people's choices, as the honourable member for Moncrieff did, especially choices for women, the basic standard of living which we are able to supply is of crucial importance. The choices people face are not abstract; they have to be real. They have to be based in real, concrete, economic and social circumstances. It is no good saying to a person facing abject poverty, `You've got some choices.' That person has to actually be offered concrete assistance to make those choices real. This is what this government is doing in relation to child care and in relation to assistance for women, and in certain cases men, staying at home looking after children.

         We do believe in the right of choice, contrary to what the honourable member for Moncrieff said. But unlike the opposition, which talks about the need for there to be a right of choice while not providing any substance or any money to support social programs, we actually find the money by a difficult balance between economic and social requirements. That is what is most important with respect to those choices.

         I totally reject the allegations made by the honourable member for Moncrieff. We are doing more all the time to offer those choices. Choices are becoming increasingly available to women who stay at home, who seek opportunities in the work force or who participate in society in other respects. They are becoming increasingly available to them because of the policies of the government in relation to child care on the one hand and to support for those who choose to stay at home on the other. It is not a question of not offering equal choices. Equal choices are being offered and people will be increasingly taking them up.

There has to be a firm, serious commitment to working out the bureaucratic arrangements that will deliver these things. That is what government is about. It is not just a question of making pronouncements. These things are never easy. It is difficult to administer these things properly and to make sure that the people who deserve them get them. Of course, we are open to suggestions from the opposition in relation to these matters, but what we have had from most of the spokespeople from the opposition is a refusal to even concentrate on these issues.

I think that is a matter that needs some attention. With respect to the participation of women in parliament, obviously the provision of significant child care and the provision of allowances and support will be very important in assisting them to participate more fully in society, including in the political process, and therefore be able to take up opportunities when they arise.

The white paper makes a tremendous contribution in the area of social justice. It gives a massive $6.5 billion injection to a whole range of programs: programs to assist women, young people in trouble and a whole range of disadvantaged people—those from non-English speaking backgrounds, Aboriginal people, those with disabilities and the homeless—and, most importantly, programs to assist the long-term unemployed to get back to work.

         In this the International Year of the Family it is very important to realise when we are talking about helping people—especially women—that most of us participate in society because of our family circumstances. For example, if in a two person family both people are long-term unemployed, desperation occurs—a certain sense of inability to participate in and be part of society. The formation of an underclass of people who feel rejected by society is a very serious matter. The white paper has addressed that, which is a very good thing.

         —I think it would be appropriate at this point to put a couple of points straight that have arisen in the course of debate. Early in my speech on the second reading I made reference to the fact that I was disappointed that the Minister for Human Services and Health (Dr Lawrence) was not here, given that the Human Services and Health Legislation Amendment Bill is her first bill.

         The Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Human Services and Health, the honourable member for Calwell (Dr Theophanous), in his reply said that I was in error. Did I not know that, as parliamentary secretary, he did legislation? He said that the minister approves policy and legislation and then he handles it here. I am well used to the honourable member for Calwell handling legislation for the Minister for Health, but the previous Minister for Health was a senator, and I really did not expect former Senator Richardson to appear in this chamber and handle this legislation.

         I was disappointed that, now that we have a minister who is a member of the House of Representatives, she is not here. This is not meant in any way to denigrate the parliamentary secretary; he knows I would not do that. But I just remind the parliamentary secretary that this arrangement can lead to an unsatisfactory situation. There have been times in debate in the committee stage in this House when certain matters have been raised—amendments and explanations and so on—and the parliamentary secretary was not in the best position to reply for the government. Instead, we were given an indication that the government could well consider favourably the amendment but was not capable of doing it here because the minister was in the Senate. So the House had to pass legislation which, it was acknowledged, could be deficient and send it to the Senate to be fixed up. I do not think that is something that any member of this House would like.

I recommend to the parliamentary secretary at the table that he take a look at the record of, for example, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training (Mr Crean). That minister also has a parliamentary secretary, the honourable member for the Northern Territory (Mr Snowdon). Nevertheless, the Minister for Employment, Education and Training makes a point of reading his own second reading speeches, of being present for his own debates, of moving his own replies to second readings, and carrying any debate that there may be in the detailed consideration of the bill. I lament the idea that ministers no longer have any sort of obligation to the parliament when it comes to the handling of their own legislation. That is enough on that subject.

         Coming to the subject of the debate, the parliamentary secretary seemed to be very proud of the fact that the home child-care allowance is funded. I remind the parliamentary secretary that rebates for child-care costs, where they are costs of employment, and equivalent payments for home child-care allowance were part of Fightback. Those very generous measures were part of the opposition's policy before the last election. It was after we had announced the details of our policy that the government came up with policies that it certainly had never mentioned before but which appeared to be equivalent to the coalition's policies.

         What the government did not mention at any stage, of course, was that it was going to fund the home child-care allowance by cashing out the dependent spouse rebate. I have already indicated that there is no problem with that. There have been many reports over the years that show that the dependent spouse rebate was a very poorly targeted benefit and that this is a better way of targeting it.

         However, those who might have been tempted to vote Labor, believing that there was going to be increased support for the family where a parent was full time at home playing the parenting role, have been disappointed because there is a cashing out of the benefit.

For example, I made reference in my speech—a reference which has been ignored by government members since—to the family allowance which was introduced by the Fraser government. This was achieved partly through a cashing out of the dependent child rebate. The major part of the cost of the introduction of the family allowance was achieved by means of very vastly increased family payments derived from the increase in the then fuel excise.

         —Since 1 April 1994 amendments to the fringe benefits tax have been implemented which have caused considerable concern throughout the community. Small businessmen and women have been placed in a position where company owned assets previously exempt from the fringe benefits tax now qualify. The concern which has been raised with me has been initiated by an elector within the Cowan electorate, Mr Brian Aitken of Kingsley. He has asked ask me to present his case to the parliament. Needless to say, this is only one example of the many businesses within the electorate of Cowan and throughout Australia that are concerned about these amendments. Mr Aitken writes:
        </para>
       </talk.start>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I am an insurance broker contracted to a major insurance broking organisation, and my wife and I operate through a proprietary limited company servicing insurance needs for some 500 clients, utilising the facilities, systems and backup of a major insurance broking house. I have an office at home, however by necessity, and convenience, travel to the inner city office where I utilise the computer systems and clerical backup which is provided.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        It is necessary for me to use my car regularly in carrying out my business and to be available on demand to visit any such clients as may require my services from time to time. In addition I need to be mobile to respond to any new business opportunities that may arise. I have chosen to purchase a regular parking spot close to the office (approximately 200 metres). For that I pay $225 per calendar month. Up until 1 April 1994 that cost was a tax deduction as a business expense reasonably incurred in earning my income. From 1 April 1994, with the cynical wave of a pen, the federal government has determined that such an expense is deemed to be a fringe benefit in that the parking paid for my company (as indeed the vehicle is owned by my company) and the company must pay fringe benefits tax on the cost of the parking.
       </para>
       <para>
        Mr Aitken continues by pointing out the bureaucracy which he is now facing to resolve the issue. He says:
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        I am told that if I can establish that I am absent from my office in town for more than four hours per day I may be exempt from this impost, but as I maintain a regular parking spot this will be difficult to establish. In addition, because of the nature of business, such activity, whilst it may be the case for several days, may not be the case on every day and therefore I will need to prove such absence from the office and apportion a comparative cost accordingly. The clerical and accounting costs involved in such an exercise will be horrendous.
       </para>
       <para font-size="-=2">
        Whilst it may be that some people could obtain a fringe benefit by having an employer pay for parking in an area close to an office, I am not completely convinced of this. I fail to see how it could be deemed that I am obtaining a fringe benefit whatsoever by my company paying for a parking spot which is necessarily required to enable me to carry out my duties as a director of that company and consequently earn my income. I see the cost as merely another cost in running a motor vehicle which is a necessary tool of my trade and of my business. My wife and I own a family car which we use for such family occasions, and rarely is the business car used for such private activities.
       </para>
       <para>
        While the amendment to the fringe benefits tax that Mr Aitken is alluding to may have seemed a good idea in theory, it is obvious that it is yet another example of the ineffectiveness in practice. Like the Family Law Act and the Child Support Agency, it seemed like a good idea at the time. It is typical of this Labor government. It has clearly stated the myth again this week that it is supporting small business. I would cite Mr Aitken of Kingsley as an example of the way the Labor government ignores the needs of small business and the business community as a whole in Australia and continues to run rampant through the ever decreasing stock it has with small businesses. I ask that the government, if it is sincere about looking after small business, consider the needs of small business in the fringe benefits tax area.

         —I rise tonight to applaud yet another significant milestone for Central Queensland and for Gladstone, which is rapidly becoming the new age industrial capital of Australia. On 8 March I attended the official opening of Queensland Cement Ltd's $33 million expansion at Fishermans Landing just north of Gladstone in my electorate of Hinkler. QCL, which is owned by the Swiss based Holderbank Group, is Queensland's largest manufacturer and distributor of cement and is one of Australia's major marketers of cement products.

       <para first-indent="16">

         The expansion at Fishermans Landing involves the addition of state-of-the-art cement milling, storage, bagging and palletising facilities. The new installations complement the established limestone mine at nearby Mount Larcom, also in my electorate, with its unique slurry transport system and existing clinker production plant at the Fishermans Landing site.

       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         For those not familiar with cement processing, I will give a quick sketch of what is involved. The first stage of cement manufacture is the production of clinker. The main raw materials in clinker are limestone, silica, iron oxide and alumina. These materials are obtained from QCL's East End mine near Mount Larcom and from sandmining leases near Gladstone. The raw materials are crushed and mixed with water to form a slurry and pumped at the rate of 250 tonnes per hour, 24 kilometres via an underground pipeline to Fishermans Landing. At Fishermans Landing the slurry is dried and then fired in a special kiln to form clinker.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         To complete the process, the clinker is combined with special amounts of gypsum and limestone and fed into a ball mill that grinds it into a very fine, light grey powder which we commonly know as cement. The cement is conveyed to a 20,000-tonne silo and is ready for dispatch either in bulk or bag form for distribution to Central and North Queensland or for export. The expanded facility has meant that QCL Gladstone can produce and dispatch approximately 600,000 tonnes of cement a year, or approximately 10 per cent of Australia's current consumption. The new additions ensure that QCL Gladstone is an internationally cost competitive cement manufacturing plant, giving the company a competitive edge in marketing cement in Australia, Oceania and South-East Asia.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         I turn briefly to the human face of the company. QCL Gladstone employs around 100 skilled and dedicated people. Recent workplace changes have resulted in the adoption of many innovative work practices, ensuring an effective workplace. The company also has its own environmental policy which provides for the efficient use of natural resources, minimising the creation of wastes and, where possible, the recycling of those wastes.
        </tab>
       </para>
       <para first-indent="16">
        <tab leading="NONE" type="NORMAL">
         In summary, I see QCL Gladstone as significant for three reasons: firstly, it sources nearly all its raw materials locally; secondly, it is a classic example of value adding, with the company now upgrading its operations to produce both clinker and cement; and, thirdly, the QCL facility at Gladstone is a prime example of regional development at its best. Would to heaven there were more QCL type initiatives in today's lacklustre white paper.

         —It is bad; is it not? QCL's establishment of a clinker plant back in the early 1980s saw the company contribute $12 million to the infrastructure of Gladstone, including the first bridge across the Calliope River in the near-Gladstone area. At the northern end of Gladstone Harbour, where it established Fishermans Landing wharf, it has improved the harbour access and has pioneered the Yarwun industrial estate just north of the city, which is now home to several major chemical plants, including ICI and Minproc.

         In other words, QCL acted as a catalyst for further development in the region as well as literally cementing—excuse the pun—Gladstone's reputation as an industrial centre. I regret I was not able to raise this matter during our sittings in March, but belatedly I wish to congratulate the company, its executives, its staff and the wider Gladstone community, for what really is a landmark in regional development.

         When export access started two years ago, it created a lot of interest with SMEs as they recognised that much of the assistance which they were seeking would be provided by the program. Export access has also been seen to be a fast track into export markets for many businesses as well as being a well structured program for firms which are about to enter international markets for the first time. Funded and administered by the Commonwealth government, export access is delivered by the private sector and participants do not pay any fees or charges.

         A fundamental aim of export access is to prepare and train smaller firms to survive and prosper in the international marketplace. Launched in October 1991 as a pilot program to handle 250 firms over three years, export access has received significant funding boosts, initially after its first 12 months in the One Nation statement in 1992, and more recently with a further commitment of $8 million in the 1993-94 Commonwealth budget.

Four hundred and eighty-five firms have been accepted into the program as at 11 March 1994 and approvals are proceeding at a rate of approximately 50 to 60 a month.

         —Many of my colleagues have noted this before. However, I would like to highlight the absurdity again. Simply put, superannuation for many casual employees is a farce. On 17 August 1993 the former Treasurer acknowledged the problem which superannuation poses for casual employees. Mr Dawkins noted then that relatively small amounts of money which had to be contributed on behalf of many casual and itinerant employees could be eroded by the fees and charges applied by their superannuation funds.

         This concern was echoed by Susan Ryan, the executive director of the Association of Superannuation Funds of Australia—she is well known to this place, particularly to the Senate—on 21 April 1994 in an article in the

        Our superannuation scheme is geared towards a person who works continuously for many years. Thus, it discriminates against people who are forced to work on a casual basis. It discriminates against many women whose working pattern is often interrupted by childbirth and some years in the home looking after children. It discriminates against rural and itinerant workers, who are forced by the nature of their work to move around the country and to work as the weather permits. It also discriminates against people who only pick up work from time to time, who form a growing group in today's economic climate.

         I had some experience of the problem of superannuation for casual employees after recently employing a person for only a few weeks. Because the employee earned more than $1,000, I was required by law to pay three per cent of her income towards superannuation. As we all know, this money has to be paid into a complying superannuation fund.

         This is not news to the many groups which have lobbied the government to amend our superannuation rules.

My colleague Senator Watson from Tasmania is the chairman of that committee. He understands the chaos of superannuation as it relates to casual employees. Committee members have already received many representations from casual workers, who are concerned about their superannuation being consumed by fees and charges.

         I note that the Australian Federation of Consumer Organisations has made a submission to the Treasurer (Mr Willis) to combat the problem. The federation proposes to establish a central fund to collect superannuation contributions for part-time and casual workers. This central fund would apply to people who have a number of part-time or casual jobs throughout the years and would enable them to pay their superannuation into one account, giving them a greater chance of accumulating something for their retirement.

         The number of part-time and casual employees is growing each year as the structure of our work force changes to combat our high unemployment. Clearly, something needs to be done about the superannuation scheme as it applies to this growing section of the work force. Superannuation is meant to be a reward and a security net for all workers. At the moment, it is simply absurd.

I have had considerable contact with constituents of mine with Grecian heritage over the past few weeks, but it is not my intention to canvass the Macedonian issue tonight. I want to use this time to draw the attention of the House to another issue which is important to Australians of Greek Cypriot heritage. It concerns the fact that Australian citizens of Greek Cypriot heritage are being denied their property ownership rights in the Turkish occupied part of Cyprus. Just over a third of the country of Cyprus has been occupied by the Turks since they invaded in July and August 1974, and it is estimated that some 200,000 people have been displaced as a result of the invasion.

         Many of those people who were displaced following the Turkish invasion have migrated to Australia, and the latest census figures confirm that there are something like 22,000 people in Australia who were born in Cyprus. It must be remembered that many Cypriots migrated to Australia prior to the Turkish invasion. One estimate I have seen is that 10,000 Cypriots own land in the Turkish occupied part of Cyprus. These people are Australian citizens who have maintained land ownership since migrating from Cyprus or have inherited the property from their parents or grandparents. It is not unreasonable to estimate the value of this property at something between $300 million and $400 million.

        (8) A figure of $115m for Melbourne-Adelaide standardisation was given in the answer to question No. 1437 in April 1992. In February 1993 the then Commonwealth Minister for Land Transport, the Hon Bob Brown MP, and the Victorian Minister for Public Transport announced a revised estimate of $153m, reflecting the decision to build a dedicated freight line to Geelong. Some $118m of the total project amount is to be spent on the Victorian section of the line. National Rail has control of project management over this section. A figure of $118m was therefore given in National Rail's 1992-93 Annual Report as the cost of the project being managed by National Rail in the Melbourne-Adelaide corridor.

        Since then it has been decided to install concrete sleepers on the track between Gheringhap (near Geelong) and Maroona (near Ararat) at a cost of $17.5m. Funding for this and other variations will come from a reallocation within the program and will bring the total cost of the Melbourne-Adelaide project to $172m ($127.7m to be spent in Victoria).

        (b)(i) Cloth which can be used on billiard tables is manufactured in Australia by Macquarie Textiles Pty Ltd. Macquarie Textiles do not manufacture high quality cloth, known as "competition quality" cloth, and a Tariff Concession (providing duty free importation) for such cloth was granted in 1991 but revoked on request from Macquarie on 21 September 1993. The concession legislation operating at that time required that the Comptroller-General should not allow a concession if "goods serving similar functions" were produced or were capable of being produced in Australia in the normal course of business. Locally produced goods did not need to be identical to the imported goods, it was sufficient under the system existing at that time that goods served a similar function.

        (1) Under current charter guidelines, the Department does not assess passenger charter flight applications under test and develop or tourism-oriented categories. However, the Department reviewed its approvals for 1993 and, had the charter flights been approved under the above categories, it estimates that 349 flights would have been test and development charters and 115 flights would have been tourism-oriented flights.

However, where carriers have notified the Department of passengers carried, these have been included in the table. In all other cases, the number of passengers carried has been estimated on the basis of 95% of the aircraft capacity in respect to tourism-oriented flights and 75% of the aircraft capacity in respect to test and development flights.

        (1) The net unit cost of each labour market program in Table 4.2 of the Committee's Report is arrived at by calculating the average gross unit cost of assistance incurred by the Department of Employment Education and Training (DEET). This gross cost covers the cost of providing training courses, wage subsidies etc. as well as income support where the latter is funded from a DEET appropriation. The net unit cost is derived by deducting from the gross unit cost the savings in Jobsearch and Newstart Allowances (JSA/NSA) accruing to the Department of Social Security (DSS) as a result of job seekers transferring from DSS benefits to a labour market program which provides DEET funded income support.

        During the course of these consultations it has been acknowledged by all participants, whether from industrialised countries or developing countries, that global political and economic changes since the adoption of the Law of the Sea Convention in 1982 had raised questions as to the appropriateness of certain aspects of Part XI. The major advance at the most recent consultations has been the development of a text which was put forward by key delegations including Australia, the  United States and other developing and industrialised countries. The text contains a draft agreement which identifies all major questions at issue between industrialised and developing states and which would institute a number of significant revisions to Part XI to bring it into line with current needs. The text has attracted widespread support.

        At the most recent consultations, held from 4-8 April 1994, agreement was reached on the two major outstanding issues relating to Part XI, with all participating delegations generally accepting the resulting text. Negotiations were not, however, formally concluded because of a perception among developing countries that, as a matter of principle, those States which have not participated in the consultations should have the opportunity to study the text and express their views. The final round of the informal consultations will take place from 31 May-4 June 1994, with the first day set aside for

        Although some uncertainties remain, the Australian Government considers that an agreement on implementing Part XI of the Law of the Sea Convention is now within reach. This would enable Australia, as well as the United States and other industrialised countries, to give serious consideration to ratifying the Law of the Sea Convention, hence ensuring that it becomes the universally accepted law on the subject. Interdepartmental discussions have already begun the process of considering Australian ratification of the Law of the Sea Convention.
