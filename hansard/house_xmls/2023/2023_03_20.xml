              <span class="HPS-Small">Prime Minister Albanese is trashing Australia's democracy by refusing to table a Bill for the "indigenous voice-to-parliament" referendum. Despite repeated calls to provide voters with specifics to debate and a model to consider, he keeps dismissing their requests by asserting this should be a conscience-vote rather than a serious issue to consider based upon how it might affect society. In short, he expects voters to provide parliament with a blank cheque to amend the Constitution so he can enjoy the benefits of lawmaking in a climate where citizens have no right of recourse, and criticism by the Opposition can be deflected by claiming voters gave him that mandate. However, as the community is concerned this policy could institute division, it is reckless to hold a referendum before the Bill has been debated because members-of-parliament need to incorporate the community's ideas to avoid designing anything which is foreseeably at odds with fostering a more inclusive-society. Therefore, instead of assuming parliament knows better than the collective-wisdom of all voters, we demand Prime Minister Albanese consults the public then tables a Bill which details every facet of his proposal; especially: (1) the exact words to be inserted into the Constitution; (2) the precise model for the "indigenous voice-to-parliament"; and (3) which aspects can be changed later without involving voters.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Between 2012-2014 many thousands of people seeking asylum arrived at Christmas Island and other places by boat. Some were taken to the mainland but others were exiled to Nauru or to Manus Island.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">As of January 2023, over 100 still languish on Nauru or in PNG. Thousands remain trapped in Community Detention within Australia, or on the merry-go-round of repeating bridging visas, or for the more fortunate, TPV or SHEVs.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The resettlements in US or Canada have been a slow drip, not even a trickle. Many years have passed, far too many. Hundreds have given up hope of resettlement, having established friendships here and feeling settled here although denied further education for themselves or their children who have grown up here speaking Australian English. The delay has caused despair, poverty, broken marriages, frustration and incredible boredom for those who are denied the dignity of work opportunities.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">The Albanese Government remains critical of the decisions made by the former government that caused so many Australians to be left stranded in precarious circumstances.

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to the email of 14 February 2022 f om the former Chair of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Petitions, Mr Ken O'Dowd MP, to the former Minister for Communications, the Hon Paul Fletcher MP, regarding Petition EN3559. I am responding to this petition as the current Minister for Communications in this term of Govenm1ent. I apologise for the delay in responding.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The signatories of this petition have expressed concern regarding the levels of gambling losses and harm experienced by Australians and are calling for the House of Representatives to ban gambling advertising on all Australian media.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government recognises the importance of gambling promotions being presented in a responsible manner. Advertising regulation in Australia is intended to strike a balance between legitimate commercial interests and appropriate community safeguards.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is committed to guaranteeing online gambling takes place under a robust legislative framework with strong consumer protections, including through the continued implementation of the National Consumer Protection Framework for Online Wagering.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">A key part of the Framework is consistent gambling messaging, which requires gambling providers to use the same messaging about the risks and potential harm of gambling in all advertisements. These new taglines will be implemented across all platforms by 30 March 2023. Further information on the new gambling messages can be found at dss.gov.au/communities-and-vulnerable-people-programs-services-gambling/information-for-online-wagering-providers.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Another part of the Framework is BetStop, a national self-exclusion register for online wagering, which is expected to launch in early 2023. If an individual self-excludes using the register, wagering providers will be required to close all betting accounts and must not let the individual place a bet, open a new account, or send them marketing messages. More information on BetStop can be found at acma.gov.au/betstop-national-self-exclusion-register.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 15 September 2022, the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Social Policy and Legal Affairs launched an inquiry into online gambling and its impacts on those experiencing gambling harm. The inquiry will include examining the effectiveness of current gambling advertising restrictions on limiting children's exposure to gambling products and services, including consideration of the impact of advertising through social media, sponsorship or branding from online licensed gambling operators. The Co1mnittee sought submissions from the public by 11 November 2022. The Government will consider the Committee's recommendations when it releases its final report.

              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to the email of 14 February 2022 from the former Chair of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Petitions, Mr Ken O'Dowd MP, to the former Minister for Communications, the Hon Paul Fletcher MP, regarding Petition EN3767.

              <span class="HPS-Small">The signatories of this petition have expressed concern regarding the publication and broadcast of photographs of victims, particularly children, in news media. The petition is calling for the House of Representatives to introduce a law where pictures of children involved in an accident, particularly at the scene of the accident, are not allowed to be shown in news media except with the express written consent of their parent or legal guardian.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government believes that a balanced, robust and independent media sector plays an important role in Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Where media services are regulated in Australia, the framework they are subject to depends on the platform on which they are provided. The importance of a free media is recognised under these frameworks through an emphasis on industry playing a leading role in the development and administration of content regulation.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Provided broadcasters and publishers meet their regulatory obligations, the selection of images shown alongside news stories is an editorial decision for each broadcaster and publisher and the Government does not seek to intervene in such decisions.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Most content broadcast in Australia is regulated by co-regulatory codes of practice developed by broadcasting industry sectors in accordance with the <span style="font-style:italic;">Broadcasting Services</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> Act 1992. </span>This co-regulatory system recognises the importance of television and radio content reflecting community standards. Codes of practice are available on the Australian Communications and Media Authority (ACMA) website at acma.gov.au/industry-codes-practice.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Generally, these codes seek to balance protections for audiences from potential harmful content while providing the opportunity for broadcasters to present newsworthy content in the public interest. However, the codes do not ban broadcasters from reporting certain news, nor do they seek to regulate the ways in which broadcasters report on or select stories.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">It is, however, worth noting that broadcasting co-regulatory codes of practice are periodically reviewed. Members of the public may contact relevant peak industry bodies to raise their concerns, and to enquire about how they can contribute to future review processes.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Ms Templeman</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I refer to correspondence of 12 January 2023, received from the Committee Secretary for the Standing Committee on Petitions and originally directed to the Minister for Women, Minister for Finance and Minister for the Public Service, Senator the Hon Katy Gallagher, concerning the working environment of employees of Services Australia (the Agency). Your correspondence has been referred to me as this matter falls within my area of responsibility.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Agency employs about 31,000 Australian public servants, who provide government services so people can get on with their lives. The Agency aims to provide services in a simple, helpful, respectful and transparent way. The Agency's services support Australians who are vulnerable or who are experiencing times of crisis or life-changing circumstances.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Agency has established processes to support staff who want to raise concerns or complaints about inappropriate behaviour in their workplaces, or to seek review of management decisions. These processes include a dedicated Respect team, which provides a human-centred approach to ensure staff can feel safe and heard when raising concerns about inappropriate behaviour such as bullying, harassment and sexual harassment.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Respect team directly helps staff resolve more than 90 per cent of the issues raised, within the first day or so from initial contact. Where there are a number of issues raised by staff in the same workplace, the Respect team may refer to the Agency's People Solutions Branch, which undertakes an appropriate organisational health intervention. Some matters are referred to the Conduct Standards team for investigation undertaken by trained staff or external workplace investigators, in accordance with procedures established by the Australian Public Service Commission. Appropriate disciplinary action is taken if a breach of the Australian Public Service (APS) Code of Conduct is proven. Sanctions imposed may include termination, suspension, reduction in classification or salary, or a financial penalty.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Respect team also provides a Staff Family and Domestic Violence service to support affected staff, provide advice on leave and support services that can be accessed and assist relocation of the staff member and family, where necessary. The Agency has also contracted an independent Employee Assistance Provider, through which staff, contractors and their families can access confidential counselling, psychological and financial advisory services.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Staff can also raise issues through their managers, Health and Safety Representatives, Harassment Contact Officers, union representatives or officials, and have access to authorities and tribunals including the APS Merit Protection Commission, Australian Human Rights Commission, Comcare, Administrative Appeals Tribunal, Commonwealth Ombudsman and Fair Work Commission.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">It is disappointing that some employees feel their psychological wellbeing is not supported by their working environment, and that it is necessary to approach their Member of Parliament. Services Australia, its executives and employees are subject to parliamentary oversight and APS processes, and employees have multiple processes and external jurisdictions to raise these issues.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email of 27 September 2022 about petition EN3957, which requests an annual evaluation of government payments, including JobSeeker and Commonwealth Rent Assistance. I apologise for the delay in responding.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government recognises that living on income support payments can be challenging, and it is important that payment rates keep up with the cost of living. To address the effects of inflation, payments such JobSeeker and pensions are increased twice a year in March and</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">September. JobSeeker is indexed in line with the Consumer Price Index (CPI), while pensions—including the Age Pension—are indexed to the higher of the increase in CPI and the Pensioner and Beneficiary Living Cost Index (PBLCI). Pensions are then benchmarked to Male Total Average Weekly Earnings (MTAWE) to ensure they keep pace with community living standards.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Other allowances, such as Youth Allowance, are indexed each year in January to CPI.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In September 2022, the Government oversaw the largest indexation increase to pensions and allowances in over a decade. For example, the basic rate of JobSeeker for a single person with no dependents increased by $25.70 a fortnight. In January 2023, around one million young people, carers and students received an increase to their income support payments. This was the largest indexation increase to Youth Allowance since the payment was introduced in 1998.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Commonwealth Rent Assistance (CRA) is available to help eligible income support recipients with the costs of renting in the private market. It is also indexed twice a year in March and September, in line with CPI, to keep pace with changes in cost of living.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As you may be aware, in December 2022 the Treasurer, the Hon Dr Jim Chalmers MP and I established an expert Economic Inclusion Advisory Committee. We have tasked the Committee to provide advice to Government on boosting economic inclusion and tackling entrenched disadvantage, including the adequacy and sustainability of income support payments ahead of every Federal Budget.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Government is committed to formally legislating the role of the Committee, and undertaking statutory appointments, in 2023. For further information on the Committee, including its membership, see ministers.dss.gov.au/media-releases/9926.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In addition to CRA, the Government has a range of policies to support access to housing, align the efforts of the Commonwealth and state and territory Governments to deliver better housing outcomes and increase housing supply and affordability for renters and buyers across Australia.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In 2022-23, the Government expects to spend around $7.2 billion to help improve housing and homelessness outcomes. This includes an expected $5.1 billion in Commonwealth Rent Assistance to help eligible households receiving income support to pay their rent, and around $1.6 billion through the National Housing and Homelessness Agreement to support state and territory governments to deliver housing and homelessness services and programs.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Ms Templeman</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 27 September 2022 enclosing petition EN3960, with three signatures, concerning Parent visas. I apologise for the delayed response.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Family migration is an important element of Australia's migration system, allowing Australian citizens and permanent residents to reunite with their family members and contribute to stronger social cohesion outcomes. It is recognised that immigrant parents can make valuable social contributions to their families and local communities.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">It has been the long-standing practice of successive governments to manage the orderly delivery of Migration Program outcomes against planning levels. The Australian Government sets the size and composition of the Migration Program each year through the Government's Budget process following consultations with state and territory governments, business and community groups and the wider public.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Following the public consultations, the permanent Migration Program is set with Australia's immediate and longer-term economic and social needs in mind. Immigration policy has enduring effects on many dimensions of Australian life. Getting the policy settings right is critical to maximising community wellbeing, and the relative merits of any policy needs to be assessed against a broader context that takes into account all the relevant dimensions of societal wellbeing.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Processing times for Parent visas are impacted by a range of factors, including the number of places the Government allocates to a program each year, and the level of demand for each visa category. High volumes of Parent visa application lodgements, which for a number of years exceeded annual migration planning levels set by successive Governments, have resulted in extended processing times.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Additionally, the COVID-19 pandemic significantly affected the availability of key assessment services (such as medical checks). This impacted applicants' ability to meet visa criteria, and disrupted the Department of Home Affairs' visa processing services.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The time taken to process visa applications can also vary according to the individual circumstances of each case. The quality and completeness of applications, applicants' responsiveness to requests for information, and the complexity often involved in assessing character, health and security requirements, can influence processing times. The processing of Family visa application backlogs, particularly in the Parent program, remains a priority for the Government.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Reducing the Parent visa backlog is a complex issue and will require a number of strategies to be successful. The lengthy processing times for Parent visas was one of the key issues raised in public submissions to the 2021-22 Senate inquiry into the 'Efficacy, fairness, timeliness and costs of the processing and granting of visa classes which provide for or allow for family and partner reunions'.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Among a range of other strategies under consideration, the Government has recognised the impact of the above factors on processing times and in the October 2022 Budget announced an increase in the migration planning level for Parent visas from 4,500 in 2021-22 to 8,500 places in 2022-23.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 2 September 2022, the Minister for Home Affairs and Minister for Cyber Security, the Hon Clare O'Neil MP, announced a comprehensive review of the purpose, structure and objectives of Australia's migration system to ensure it meets the challenges of the coming decade. Further information on the review can be found on the Department's website at: https://www.homeaffairs.gov.au/help-and-support/how-to-engage-us/consultations/australias-22-23-migration-program. The future direction of the Family visa program, including Parent visas, will be informed as part of this review.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Most permanent and temporary visas are subject to Public Interest Criterion (PIC) 4003(a) in the Migration Regulations 1994, which states that a visa held by a person whose presence in Australia is, or would be contrary to Australia's foreign policy interests, may be cancelled.

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email of 27 September 2022 regarding Petition EN4049. I apologise for the delay in responding.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The signatories of this petition have expressed concern regarding interference on the 87.6MHz frequency in the Ballarat licence area. The petition is calling for the House of Representatives to make available FM frequencies 97.6MHz and 95.9MHz for allocation to other broadcasters, preferably to PHAZE Broadcasting Pty Ltd.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Under the <span style="font-style:italic;">Radiocommunications Act 1992 </span>and the <span style="font-style:italic;">Broadcasting Services Act 1992, </span>the Australian C01mnunications and Media Authority (ACMA) is responsible for planning and allocating radio frequency spectrum to radio broadcasting services. ACMA issued the <span style="font-style:italic;">Broadcasting Services (Availability of Spectrum</span><span style="font-style:italic;">—</span><span style="font-style:italic;">Open Narrowcasting Services) Determination 2022 </span>to make part of the FM spectrum range (87.5 MHz to 88.0 MHz) available for allocation of low power open narrowcast (LPON) transmitter licences until 31 December 2035.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">LPON services are limited in a number of ways, as reflected in their licence conditions and this can include narrow content or limited coverage. These services do not have any guarantee of spectrum and if they cause interference to other radio services, ACMA can cancel their licence. This is one the reasons why LPON licences are not as costly and have a much lighter regulatory regime that other radio services.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">ACMA established the LPON sub-band to provide scope for LPON operators while also protecting the interference regimes of the existing national, commercial and co1mnunity radio services within each licence area. It is an ACMA decision on whether there are available frequencies within a licence area and a key consideration is interference. LPON services would not be moved to frequencies outside the sub-band and planning for any other FM frequencies within Ballarat licence area would require significant technical planning work by ACMA. As such, LPON services in the Ballarat region are limited to FM centre frequencies 87.6 MHz, 87.8 MHz and 88.0 MHz and any other frequencies if identified would be allocated according to the appropriate radio process.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">ACMA has been working with PHAZE FM on this issue for some time and has been investigating inference claims and licence condition compliance.</span>

Fixed electric lighters are in place in all designated outdoor smoking areas.

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence concerning Petition EN4351—Prohibit the release of helium filled balloons and regulate the sale and use of helium to inflate balloons.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Management of waste is primarily the responsibility of state and territory governments, which regulate and manage waste in accordance with their respective legislation, policies and programs. The Australian Government notes that some jurisdictions have banned the release of balloons.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government is responsible for national legislation, strategies and policy frameworks for waste, including measures that give effect to obligations under international agreements. The Government meets regularly with states and territories and continues to discuss priorities for phase out of single use plastics, but these are ultimately concerns for state and territory governments and their regulatory agencies.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Local governments have responsibility for waste management within their local areas as laid down by the regulatory framework of each state or territory.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Local and state governments may raise awareness of responsible waste disposal through information campaigns, in addition to regulations and processes used to minimise and manage waste.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">It is the responsibility of every citizen, including businesses and community organisations, to minimise their impact on the environment and dispose of waste in a responsible manner.</span>

              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 28 November 2022 regarding Petition Ministerial Referral (EN4515)—<span style="font-style:italic;">Rainbow Warrior. </span>I appreciate the time you have taken to bring this matter to my attention.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Royal Australian Navy's ship naming process is well established and places a strong emphasis on promoting links between the Navy and the Australian community, reflecting a uniquely Australian identity.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Chief of Navy and I receive many requests to name new Royal Australian Navy vessels, normally after cities, towns and regions of Australia. This is a notable and pleasing demonstration of the great respect that communities, ex-service groups and individuals have for the Navy.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Naval History Section at the Sea Power Centre -Australia, registers each request. Reviewing these numerous requests is an integral part of the naming process and I can assure you that all representations receive careful consideration. The process examines many aspects including history, community expectations and the need to balance representation from across Australia.</span>

                <span style="font-style:italic;">
                </span>Thank you for your correspondence of 28 November 2022 concerning petition number EN4540, <span style="font-style:italic;">Hold IRGC accountable for the death of </span><span style="font-style:italic;">M</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ahsa Amini.</span></span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government strongly condemns the ongoing and reprehensible actions of the Iranian regime. We have been active and consistent in publicly calling out Iran on its egregious behaviour and continue to advocate strongly in support of the human rights of the Iranian people. We have also imposed targeted sanctions on a number of Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) linked persons and entities.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I understand that those who are calling for the IRGC to be listed under the Criminal Code want the IRGC to face consequences for its actions. However, listing an organisation is not a foreign policy measure to increase pressure on foreign governments. The purpose of listings under the Criminal Code is to make it easier to prosecute individuals in Australia for supporting terrorist organisations. Under the Criminal Code, a terrorist organisation is a non-state actor that seeks to intimidate a government or the public to advance a political, religious or ideological cause through the use of violence. As an organ of a nation state, the IRGC is not the kind of entity that is covered by the terrorist organisation provisions in the Criminal Code.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I also note that listing an organisation as a terrorist organisation under the Criminal Code does not enliven new powers for the Australian Federal Police or the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, nor expand the range of offences that can be investigated by law enforcement.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Chair</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence to the Treasurer, the Hon Dr Jim Chalmers MP concerning Petition EN4545 on the consistent use of USB-C charging ports in portable consumer electronics. Your correspondence has been referred to me for response.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">On 24 October 2022 the European Union mandated a common charging port for consumer electronics such as mobile phones, tablets and headphones. The change is expected to harmonise charging technology and to reduce electronic waste as a single charger will be used for multiple devices.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">While the Australian Government currently does not have any plans to mandate the use of USB-C charging ports for these products, I note that the Minister for the Environment and Water, the Hon Tanya Plibersek MP, has established a Ministerial Advisory Group on the Circular Economy. One of the tasks of that group is to advise the Australian Government on how to best design out waste, which may include the merits of a mandatory USB-C standard. I intend to work with the Minister for the Environment and Water as the Australian Government works through the options in this area.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">In addition to this, Australia may see the rollout of phones, tablets, and devices with a common charger without regulatory intervention as manufacturers change their product design to comply with international markets.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence of 28 November 2022 regarding Petition EN4548 concerning the administration of the Defence Force Retirement and Death Benefits (DFRDB) scheme and commuted pensions available under that scheme.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The DFRDB scheme and commuted pensions available under that scheme were reviewed by the Commonwealth Ombudsman in 2019 and by the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade Reference Committee in 2021.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Commonwealth Ombudsman concluded that some DFRDB scheme members were led to believe incorrectly that their commuted pension would increase once they lived passed the life expectancy factors set out in the scheme. The Ombudsman found this amounted to defective administration by Defence.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">As a consequence, the Secretary of Defence and Chief of the Defence Force issued an apology on 3 December 2019, which was published in the Ombudsman's report on 11 December 2019. This letter acknowledged and apologised for the confusion and emotional impact the incorrect information may have caused to veterans.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Members of the DFRDB scheme who believe they have suffered a financial detriment as a result of the provision of such erroneous information, are encouraged to lodge a claim under the Scheme for Compensation for Detriment caused by Defective Administration (CDDA scheme). Members can obtain a payment if they can show they are worse off as a consequence of such defective administration, as compared against if they had not elected to commute their pension.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Defence has tailored the claims process to help focus on the issues critical to the determination of the claim and provided members access to a case manager to assist with the process. A claim can be lodged under this CDDA scheme by completing the DFRDB CDDA Application Form found at: www.defence.gov.au/legal/Directorates/dsfc.asp. The form can be submitted to: dl.deldc@defence.gov.au.</span>

            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your correspondence regarding petition EN4571 requesting Australia take action against the Iranian regime.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">We have all been moved by the bravery of the Iranian people and appalled by the brutality of the Iranian regime towards its own citizens.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Australia has been integral to building pressure internationally and was at the forefront of efforts to remove Iran from the Commission for the Status of Women. Australia co- sponsored and advocated for the successful Human Rights Council resolution for the establishment of an independent fact-finding mission to investigate human rights violations in Iran.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Albanese Government has imposed Magnitsky-style human rights sanctions on 22 individuals and three entities over their involvement in the Iranian regime's abhorrent, flagrant and continued human rights violations. Among those subject to Magnitsky-style human rights sanctions are Iran's Morality Police and the Basij Resistance Force, and senior law enforcement and military figures—including those within the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Additionally, Australia has joined partners to impose additional targeted financial sanctions on seven Iranian individuals and five entities involved in the production and supply of drones to Russia, that have been used in its illegal and immoral invasion of Ukraine.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The Australian Government has consistently and forcefully raised our concerns directly with Iran. I have written to Iran's Foreign Minister and the Attorney-General has written to his counterpart, including to reaffirm in the strongest terms Australia's opposition to the death penalty. We have summoned the Charge on numerous occasions. Our Ambassador has made representations in Tehran, including directly to the Deputy Foreign Minister.</span>

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Dear Ms Templeman</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">Thank you for your email dated 6 February 2023, concerning petition number EN4578 which requests introducing an exemption to the Disability Support Pension (DSP) income test for citizens who have suffered long-term disability due to injury via any Therapeutic Goods Administration approved vaccine.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">For most of its history, Australia's pension system has used means testing to ensure the system is targeted to those who need it most, and to ensure its sustainability into the future. The <span style="font-style:italic;">Social Security Act 1991 </span>provides that for couples, the combined assets and income of both partners are taken into account when entitlement for a social security payment is assessed. This longstanding provision is based on the principle that couples generally share their resources and can gain some economies from living together.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">The DSP income test is designed to encourage people to supplement their income support payments with other income, if they are able to do so. A DSP recipient and their partner can receive an amount of income before their DSP starts to be reduced. The operation of the DSP income test free area and taper rate means that DSP recipients are always better off while they (or their partner) are earning income in addition to their DSP payments.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">DSP is designed to provide support to individuals if they have a permanent physical, intellectual or psychiatric impairment. It is not designed to replace lost salary or wages.</span>
            </p>
            <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
              <span class="HPS-Small">I appreciate you bringing this matter to my attention.</span>

We have longstanding concerns about the situation of human rights in Pakistan, and we continue to monitor developments on freedom of expression and peaceful assembly of political, media and civil society actors.</span>

Our first step has been to create a one-page quick guide to petitions that sets out the petitioning rules that, in the committee's experience, petitioners seem to have the most trouble with.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The guide is on our website. But I've also sent it to all members of parliament as a resource they can share with their constituents, and I'd urge them to have a chat with their offices and make sure they know where it is and have it available, should they be asked. We know that members of parliament are routinely asked about how to petition the House. This simple guide can be emailed or printed and should assist Australians to make in-order petitions. There's also more detailed information on how to petition and the process for petitions on the petitions website.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We recognise that the offices of members of parliament are often the go-to place for questions on everything related to parliamentary procedure.

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For too long, the boundaries between work and life have been blurred, continuous connection to work has been normalised and the pressure to be available at all hours of the day and night has been building for working people across the country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">With the proliferation of smartphones and advances in technology, work emails are only a notification away and a phone call from your boss can interrupt a night out with friends or family. Workers are often expected to be on call 24/7 to answer emails, take calls and be available to their employers at a moment's notice.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Senate work and care committee described this phenomenon as 'availability creep'. I want to take this opportunity to thank my colleague Greens Senator Barbara Pocock for her invaluable work on the work and care committee inquiry, the first ever of its kind in the country. As chair of the committee, her leadership resulted in a landmark report supported by the Greens, the government and the coalition.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee learned there are many causes of availability creep. Insecure work and rostering practices can result in workers being expected to remain available and on call to secure work. Advances in technology have been exacerbated by the pandemic and it is now common for work to be completed outside of the workplace and outside of work hours. Long hours and large workloads mean some people are expected to work outside their normal hours just to complete their workload.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee found examples of a formal right to disconnect in Australia and across the world. France first implemented legislation on the right to disconnect in early 2017, where employers were required to negotiate an agreement with unions for a right to disconnect from technology after working hours. Similar policies have been adopted in Belgium, Ireland, Italy, Portugal and Spain. In Australia, the most recent Victorian police enterprise bargaining agreement contains a right-to-disconnect clause.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Availability creep impacts mental health, exacerbates work-life stress, productivity and takes workers further away from the principle of a fair day's work for a fair day's pay. It is important to recognise the additional negative impacts availability creep has on working carers. The committee's final report stated that availability creep:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… is especially burdensome for working carers who already juggle competing demands on their time. Being expected to work outside core or rostered hours interrupts their availability to provide informal care and reduces their already limited opportunities to participate in other activities such as study, leisure or rest.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the key recommendations from the work and care report was that the government consider amending the Fair Work Act 2009 to include an enforceable right to disconnect under the National Employment Standards.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill reflects that recommendation and amends the Fair Work Act 2009<span style="font-style:italic;"></span>to prevent employers from contacting employees outside work hours, and ensures employees are not required to monitor, read or respond to emails, telephone calls or any other kinds of communication from an employer outside their working hours. An exception applies in circumstances where it is an emergency or genuine welfare matter, or the employee is in receipt of an availability allowance for the period in which the contact is made. There is a simple principle underlying this bill: when you clock off, you should have the right to log off. You shouldn't have to answer phone calls, emails or texts from your employer outside of working hours unless you're getting paid for it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I urge the government to support this bill. The right to disconnect is about giving workers the freedom to switch off and focus on their personal lives outside of work. It is about recognising that work should not consume every aspect of our lives and working people should have the ability to recharge and reconnect with their families, friends and communities.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill is not about limiting the ability of employers to communicate with their employees or to get work done. It will promote a healthier work culture that empowers working people to screen their bosses' calls when they're off the clock. Our workplace laws were not drafted at a time when everyone had a smartphone in their pocket and was only a phone call, text message or email away from their work. They were drafted at a time before the pandemic, when working via technology became the norm for many people and much more normal for everyone else. This bill will give people the right to log off when they clock off and to say, unless you're getting paid for it, your time is your own, and your employer does not have the right to contact you by text, email or phone when you're enjoying your leisure.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to acknowledge the Albanese Labor government's $3 billion in funding in the 2022 October budget for the infrastructure that the residents of New South Wales need and the infrastructure that the residents of New South Wales deserve. Take my home town, the Central Coast in New South Wales. Our road network has been neglected for quite some time. It's been neglected for the past 10 years. What does that mean? That means that there have been significant social, employment and health impacts. It's not just infrastructure—it's not just bitumen; it's not just bricks; it's not just mortar. It's about building the foundations of our society and of our community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When we have congested road networks and roads that are falling apart and aren't well maintained, this impacts the ability of an ambulance to reach a patient and then transport them to hospital. It impacts the fire truck getting to the scene of that bushfire, to make a difference—to save lives and save property. It stops the police responding to a call involving domestic violence. It stops parents picking up their kids from school. It means that working people are stuck in traffic rather than (1) being at their place of work or (2) spending time with their loved ones and family. This isn't limited to the Central Coast. This is a widespread issue throughout New South Wales. I look at places like the Hunter, the Blue Mountains, Western Sydney and the South Coast. All of these places are going to benefit from the commitment made by the Albanese Labor government in the last budget, and they will continue to benefit under an Albanese Labor government into the future. We need repair and renewal of our infrastructure, and that is exactly what we're doing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This was not only a major issue during the election; it's a major issue now. It's our infrastructure. It's the bricks and the mortar. It's what's building our community. We need to keep pace with the growing population in our regional centres and city centres. It's absolutely vital that we keep pace. These projects will grow our regions. They're going to support our regions. They're going to provide our people with the infrastructure and support that they so desperately need and so desperately deserve. The Australian government, the Albanese Labor government, is committed to investing in the right infrastructure projects that support New South Wales's growing cities and regions and that are underpinned by strong supportive evidence and demonstrated value for money.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I will give you a few examples of how this is going to benefit and impact my community. I'm talking about the significant upgrade at Avoca Drive, through Kincumber. This is a significant pinch point in my community, with significant traffic. We're talking about parents with kids being stuck in that traffic. We're talking about ambulances not being able to pass. We're talking about significant safety issues for pedestrians and people riding bicycles. It's the missing link that connects our centres on the Central Coast to our regional coastal villages like Avoca, Saratoga, Davistown, Erina and Gosford. All of those places are impacted because we did not get the infrastructure that we needed in the past decade. But I'm proud that our government, the Albanese Labor government, is investing heavily in regional roads.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also look at the millions in investment that we are providing in our local roads. These local roads aren't just small roads; they're large roads that connect the major arterials that are used by our residents, right across the Central Coast. Those roads have been neglected and forgotten for so long. As a local who grew up in Umina, on the southern end of the Central Coast, I'm so proud and pleased that I'm part of a team on this side of the House that's getting behind New South Wales regional and metropolitan infrastructure. It is so important that we connect our community. It's so important that New South Wales gets the infrastructure that it needs and deserves.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="L6B" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr FLETCHER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bradfield</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Manager of Opposition Business</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:14</span>):  The motion moved by the new member for Robertson is a collection of half-truths, highly misleading statements and deliberate omissions about the coalition's infrastructure track record. The most egregious of those concern the claims that are made in relation to funding for roads on the Central Coast, because the motion refers to $40 million of funding for Central Coast roads in the October budget. I think it's important that the House should be fully acquainted with the facts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The first relevant fact is that the former coalition government committed to an $86.5 million Central Coast roads package. This was fully funded, and the funding was fully allocated. There was a funding profile which extended over several years, with the final component of this total package to be provided in the 2026-27 year. That was the starting point. Then, on 11 May, the coalition committed to a further package of $40 million to improve the safety and quality of roads in the Central Coast region. Roads to be upgraded under this package include Hue Hue Road, Jilliby; Alison Road, Wyong; The Scenic Road at MacMasters Beach; Davistown Road at Saratoga and Davistown; Rickard Road, Empire Bay; Lakedge Avenue, Berkeley Vale; Peats Ridge Road, Somersby; and Cape Three Points Road, Avoca Beach. The funding was to be provided to local government in the region to support its roadworks program. Again I emphasise that this was in addition to the $86.5 million already committed and budgeted.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On 13 May, two days later, the Labor Party matched the coalition's $40 million Central Coast roads package election policy. In Labor's announcement, the then Labor candidate—and now Labor member—for Robertson, had this to say: 'This $40 million investment will also ease congestion and save locals from damaging their cars because of crater-sized potholes on our roads.' What he should have said was: 'We are committing to this funding for one reason only—because the Liberal member for Robertson, Lucy Wicks, fought hard to get this money and Prime Minister Morrison and Treasurer Frydenberg agreed to it, and now I'm coming along to free ride on all of Lucy Wicks's hard work.' If the member for Robertson had been into giving full disclosure to his soon-to-be constituents, that is what he would have said.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the story does not end there. We need to look at what the Albanese Labor government did in the October budget. On the one hand, yes, it's true: the Albanese Labor government delivered on the coalition's election promise for a $40 million Central Coast roads package—the package that they scrambled to match during the election. But they did something else. They cut $35.7 million from the pre-existing Central Coast roads package, cancelling proposed upgrades to Rawson Road and Springwood Street. It doesn't stop there; it gets worse. In addition, they deferred by two years $13.9 million originally budgeted for 2022-23 and $18.2 million budgeted from 2023-24, under the pre-existing Central Coast roads package.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If the Labor member for Robertson were to be honest with his constituents, he would tell him that, on his watch, the net funding change for Central Coast roads across those two years—2022-23 and 2023-24—was minus $37.8 million because, while he might have got an extra $40 million for Central Coast roads, he stood by and did nothing while $67.8 million was taken away or deferred. This Labor member for Robertson is a mug. He got completely conned by a Victorian based minister for infrastructure and a Queensland based Treasurer. I tell you what: Lucy Wicks would never have fallen for this pea-and-thimble trick.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is a proud coalition legacy of investments to benefit the Central Coast, with $1 billion funded in the March 2022-23 budget for the Tuggerah to Wyong faster rail upgrade and $336 million to upgrade the Pacific Highway through Wyong. Also, in the March 2022 budget, there is $51.2 million to upgrade the Central Coast Highway and Tumbi Road intersection, which is a project Labor have delayed in the October 2022 budget—a very familiar story—and more than $35 million committed to Central Coast council under the Roads to Recovery Program and the Local Roads and Community Infrastructure Program. Our government delivered for the Central Coast, and Lucy Wicks was a great member. The current member is not up to it.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr FREELANDER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macarthur</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:20</span>):  I'm quite outraged by the comments from the member for Bradfield. The new suburb around Western Sydney Airport—guess what they've called it? They're so original: 'Bradfield'. In spite of people wanting an Aboriginal name, an Indigenous name, what did the last government do? They called it 'Bradfield'. That's how clever they are. The only mug in the building today is the member for Bradfield. Ask him about the rail link to Western Sydney Airport from the most rapidly growing area of New South Wales, my electorate of Macarthur. The last government turned away from the electors in my electorate. They did not give them a public transport link to Western Sydney Airport, and yet they're providing a link—no business case required—to the north, to the electorate of Lindsay. It's a shame, completely political, biased and another sign of the terrible infrastructure basis that the previous government worked on. It was all about the politics, not about the need.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I congratulate my friend the member for Robertson for moving this motion. We live in very uncertain economic times. Our government, the Albanese government, acknowledges the importance of good, responsible infrastructure developments. That's why, in the October budget, our government committed to $3 billion in infrastructure projects in New South Wales this financial year and almost $15 billion over the forward estimates. This is important as we've had, particularly in the western and south-western suburbs of Sydney and in country areas, neglect from the New South Wales Liberal government and the previous Liberal-National government nationally. Macarthur's a fine example of this neglect, as are the surrounding electorates of Werriwa and Hume, with the electorate of Hume being woefully represented by the shadow Treasurer. I often hear from residents of Hume that they're not happy with their lack of representation and the lack of infrastructure in their areas. It's a real issue for these three electorates and for many others around New South Wales.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One example of this is the lack of early education investment in the new, developing areas of Macarthur. We're the biggest electorate in the country by population, yet we have a lack of schools, a lack of infrastructure for public transport, a lack of hospitals and a lack of health care. Previous governments, state and federal, have done very little. I recently went to a preschool, Goodstart Early Learning, in Willowdale, which used to be a farm. It's now a rapidly increasing suburb, and the preschool there has over 900 families on the waiting list. That often means that both parents can't work, that children are spending time at private child care and that people are childminding in their homes. It's just a sign of lack of infrastructure spending by previous state and federal Liberal governments. They're not small issues. They are important for our national productivity and important for how we are going to manage the future, which is an increasingly challenging one.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have some wonderful companies in Macarthur. I've visited places like Woolstar, who make high-quality Australian quilts, blankets and bedding from wool. They've been in Ingleburn for over 25 years and have a thriving business. But their workers need to get to work, and there's very little public transport. They need better infrastructure if they're going to export more of their products. Another fine example is DECO group, which is in Minto and is led by its founder, Ross Doonan. It produces very high-technology advanced coatings and membranes for architectural, signage and other needs, including in the health industry. We have wonderful businesses, but they need to be supported by infrastructure. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm sorry to say that previous state and federal governments—Liberal governments—have not provided the infrastructure that my constituents need. Even around Macarthur station, the state and federal Liberal governments argued about a commuter car park. They promised one but it has never been delivered. For the Western Sydney Airport, we need a heavy rail link from Leppington to take freight from the Moorebank Intermodal to the airport and to connect Western Sydney Airport with Sydney Kingsford Smith Airport. The previous government turned their backs on us. It's just terrible, what they've done. The most rapidly growing area failed to get public transport links from the previous government. Our government, through Catherine King, is committed to this but we need the state government to come to the party first.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lindsay</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:25</span>):  I'd first like to acknowledge my Western Sydney colleague the member for Macarthur and his passion for Western Sydney. But I feel on this occasion it's a little bit misplaced because on the other side of Western Sydney I am now waiting for those commitments the Labor government made during the last election, with no delivery in sight, and I'd like to thank the member for Robertson for bringing this motion to the House today because it enables me to speak about these commitments the Labor government made to my community that we are now waiting for. There were some interjections earlier when the member for Bradfield was talking about 'all announcements and no delivery from those opposite'—well, that would be amusing if it wasn't actually extremely true in Western Sydney.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the 2019 election I fought really hard for the upgrade to Dunheved Road in my community, and this upgrade has been needed for so long. I achieved half the amount that was needed so I went back to the Commonwealth and fought for some more, and at the 2022 election the Labor candidate and the Labor Party committed to fast-tracking this project. We are now a year into the Albanese government, and I would like to know what the Prime Minister's interpretation of fast-tracking a project is, because we are not fast-tracking. I'm still waiting to hear from the council about when this project will start, if in fact fast-tracking happens—typical Labor announcing something and not delivering for my people in Western Sydney, just like committing to a Medicare urgent care clinic during this election, by this May, for Lindsay, yet this won't happen on time either. It may have even been delayed to the end of the year, as we heard in Senate estimates. So already from the last election we have one election commitment that we know nothing about, we have heard nothing about, from the Albanese government and another one that has been delayed months and months.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Another example is the $264.9 million that has been delayed for the Sydney Metro project as part of the new Western Sydney international airport. It's interesting that New South Wales Labor want to cut additional Sydney Metro corridors for Western Sydney, and it seems like their colleagues in the federal Labor Party want to do the same. So I'm asking the question on behalf of my community: what does this Labor government have against public transport for people in Western Sydney and particularly my area of Western Sydney? Another delay that will impact my community is the $3 million that was committed for Werrington Arterial Stage 2 planning. There is absolutely no indication where this is at. Even searching on the website there are no start and finish times for this project, so again we're waiting. A commitment has been made, $3 million from the federal government and also the state, and we're waiting for that to happen.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The motion notes the Castlereagh corridor, which actually runs through my electorate of Lindsay, and again this was an election commitment. So this is election commitment 3 from the 2022 election we're waiting on, and we're not hearing anything about this Castlereagh corridor. Unfortunately the department's website says start and end dates are yet to be decided. So we have Dunheved Road fast-tracking, no fast-tracking; we have the Medicare urgent care clinic being delayed; and we have no information on yet another election commitment, the Castlereagh corridor, which runs through my electorate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Treasurer's first budget, in October, was an absolute dud for the people of New South Wales on transport infrastructure: $2.3 billion slashed from the infrastructure program over the forward estimates for projects across my home state, and around the country $4.7 billion cut from key programs to benefit small to large-scale projects that will allow importantly—and I know this because it happens in my electorate—people to get to work and home again. People in my community have to commute, and, when infrastructure projects are cut or delayed, this has a real impact on families that spend so much time commuting to work and home again. This is time they could be spending at home with their kids and having a better quality of life, so I ask the government: please come forward with further information on the projects you committed to for my community, the delays, and whether you're actually going to go through with them at all. </span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms TEMPLEMAN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macquarie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:30</span>):  I would urge the member for Lindsay, if she's looking at delays and other things, to look at the New South Wales Liberals and ask them what's happening. Let's remember that so much of our funding goes to that state government, and, gee, I'm hoping that on Saturday we get a new state government in New South Wales, a Labor state government who'll be able to deliver on the things that people expect. In Greater Western Sydney our infrastructure has been long neglected by state and federal Liberals, but under the Albanese government there's real money to get these key projects going. The new Richmond Bridge, with $400 million for the duplication of the bridge, follows the process we started in 2010. It's crucial that this project is done right so that the benefits are real, while reducing the negative impacts. I'll continue to support the community as the New South Wales government work through the design. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The October budget contained an additional $11.2 million to upgrade local roads in the Hawkesbury and $12.5 million for Blue Mountains roads. This nearly $25 million package will be delivered through councils, and I look forward to working closely with them as they now proceed to do the roadworks. Plus, there was $300 million for the Western Sydney roads package, which has $50 million for planning and proprietary works for the Castlereagh Connection to Castlereagh Road, $37 million for Richmond Road planning and $75 million for planning and early works in the north-west growth corridor, all of which have been long needed so that they bring improvements in connectivity and reduce congestion. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's a myriad of smaller projects through programs such as Roads to Recovery and black spots funding, but we're also moving on those longer-term, big projects, with making high-speed rail a priority. We've already passed the legislation to establish the High Speed Rail Authority, and the speed rail connections between Sydney, the Central Coast and Newcastle are moving closer to reality via a $500 million investment to start corridor acquisition, planning and early works, all the stuff that has to happen to make these things land on the ground. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The former government made promises without ever thinking about how to deliver them, often without talking to even the state or territory governments they'd later rely on and partner with. For years they pretended money was in the budget for zombie project—ridiculous. The Albanese government is ensuring the Commonwealth's infrastructure spending is responsible, affordable and sustainable, while making up for nearly a decade of waste and missed opportunities. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The biggest piece of infrastructure impacting the Blue Mountains, in my electorate, is the Western Sydney airport. I hold very strong views about this airport, and my biggest concern is the effect of flight paths on the residents of the Blue Mountains region and the World Heritage area. It's an area where the ambient noise levels are low, and even the current Sydney Airport flight paths can cause annoyance. By the middle of the year we will see the planned flight paths, and I want to acknowledge the minister for infrastructure for being open about the planning process and recognising the strength of feeling on this, including from my constituents. There are a few things we do already know. We know that the Blaxland merge point is gone and any other single merge point is gone. We know that overflights of residential areas and noise-sensitive facilities will be avoided to the maximum extent possible. We know that airspace design will consider the impacts of air operations on natural and visually sensitive areas, and we know there is a requirement to minimise the impact of night-time aircraft operations. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But we also know that this is a 24/7 airport and that the Blue Mountains will be subjected to additional aircraft noise. So, what can people expect? Well, when the preliminary flight path design is released, it will have a noise tool that will allow you to put in an address and see what the likely impact will be. I want people to really understand what lines on paper mean for us in real life, and this noise tool is vital for that. I expect wide discussion and, to be frank, concern when that is released. After that, there'll be the formal EIS process, specifically for the flight paths, which will contain additional detailed studies and information and to which people will have a chance to put in a formal submission.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government's commitment is that the time available to respond will be well beyond the statutory requirement. I'll be ensuring that information is widely shared as this progresses, but I'd urge people to be familiar with the new website that's been launched, wsiflightpaths.gov.au. That was released at the FoWSA meeting I attended on Saturday, and I want to thank people who were at that meeting or who submitted questions to it. The new website will tell you where you can attend public information stands. I'm really urging people to stay engaged. We need to make sure our voice is heard. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Riverina</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:35</span>):  We have set the scene early. It's state election day this Saturday. Pre-polls opened on Saturday, just gone, and already Labor is out bashing the Perrottet-Toole government, saying they don't deserve to be re-elected, talking up Chris Minns, talking up Labor in the state. The last thing Australia needs is wall-to-wall red, wall-to-wall socialism! The last thing we need is to have a Labor government in Macquarie Street and a Labor government in Canberra. That's what the voters of New South Wales will get if the polls go that way this Saturday. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Perrottet-Toole government deserves to be re-elected. We should be concentrating on federal matters in the federal parliament. But Labor—in true, typical Labor style—will spend all of this week talking up Labor in New South Wales. They'll spend all week disguising the fact that energy prices are going up and up and up on their watch. They'll spend all week talking about everything but what they should be doing. There will be one little rider: they'll be taking credit for AUKUS. They'll be taking credit for the subs deal, which came about because of a coalition federal government. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm glad that the shadow defence minister is at the table, because all of that Defence spending, all of those measures and the new pact between the United States of America and the United Kingdom, came about on the coalition's watch, as you'd expect it would. I'm also glad that the member for Eden-Monaro is at the table. When it comes to infrastructure in New South Wales and the black spot program for mobile phones, she did very well—she's nodding; she knows she did very well—yet 25 out of 26 of those mobile phone towers went to Labor seats. Talk about disingenuous! Talk about hypocritical! It is writ large with those opposite. </span>

                  </a>  Indeed I am, thank you. It is an absolute abomination that no National Party seat received a mobile black spot tower in the latest round, which was said to be an election commitment round. But it was not described as that. It was described as an 'improving mobile phone coverage' around. If it's securing better mobile coverage, some of that money, some of those towers, should have gone to National Party seats, because we hold the majority of the landmass in New South Wales. And thank goodness for that. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Robertson comes to this place, with this private member's bill, talking about neglect. There was no neglect when the coalition was in power. There was $120 billion of infrastructure supporting 110,000 or so jobs. That is delivery. If we want to talk about delivery and we want to talk about New South Wales, let's talk about Rose Jackson, the New South Wales water spokesperson who, not that long ago, when asked if a future potential Labor government in New South Wales supported raising the Wyangala Dam wall, said, 'Never mind increasing the dam wall; let's just improve the roads out of Forbes so people can escape quicker.' That is disgraceful. That is disgusting to regional people who have been flooded out six times, at least, in the last 12 years. Here they were, knee-deep—in some places even higher—in floodwater, and you've got the person who will potentially be the minister looking after water and possibly even infrastructure in a future Minns Labor government—it'll be coerced by the Greens, of course, as Labor always are; they are always bedmates with the Greens—talking about making better escape routes, rather than raising a vital piece of water infrastructure. That's the Labor way. They don't care about regional areas. They don't care about infrastructure in country towns and country districts, which provide the food and fibre for this nation and will continue to do that despite what Labor may say or do.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">So the best those voters in New South Wales—seeing that we're going to be spending a lot of time talking about it—can do is to re-elect a Liberal-Nationals government and get Sam Farraway continuing to create road infrastructure in New South Wales.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="147140" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs PHILLIPS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gilmore</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:40</span>):  For anyone who knows me, it will come as no surprise that I am ecstatic that the Australian government has committed $3 billion to infrastructure projects in New South Wales this financial year and $14.9 billion into the future. I've proudly delivered billions of dollars in infrastructure projects in Gilmore through the local government areas of Kiama, the Shoalhaven and the Eurobodalla. From Minnamurra in the north to Tuross Head in the south, I know how important our safe and reliable roads are, and I want to make sure that roads support the needs of local people now and into the future. I have driven on these roads my whole life, and I know how important they are.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Before we were in government, and since we came into government, I have called for more funding for our Princes Highway. Anyone who has driven north or south through Nowra knows how necessary this is. Bottlenecks hold tourists up and frustrate locals no end, which is why I was so pleased to recently join with my community and walk over the new Nowra Bridge for the official opening to traffic. It had $155 million in funding from the federal government and $155 million from the state government, something I am incredibly proud of.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But it's not going to stop at the Nowra Bridge. My eyes for some time have been on new projects, like the Nowra bypass. This critical piece of infrastructure should already have been underway, but, with the Liberals dragging their feet every step of the way, the Albanese Labor government have had to pick up the slack. The Albanese Labor government have put forward $97 million in federal funding to get the Nowra bypass going. That's $97 million out of a total of $105 million. That shows our commitment to getting infrastructure moving and, by extension, shows the Liberals' unwillingness to come to the table with any meaningful budgeted contribution—yes, not one cent. We need to get the Nowra bypass started now, and I am proud to be making that happen.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In another win before the election—and this has been delivered in the budget—I was absolutely thrilled to be able to announce the Albanese Labor government's $40 million investment in local Shoalhaven roads. This money will help Shoalhaven City Council to repair our potholed and damaged roads. Last Friday, at a community meeting at Kangaroo Valley, I spoke to the CEO of Shoalhaven City Council, Stephen Dunshea, who told me happily that the agreement for the $40 million to fix our roads in the Shoalhaven has been received. He told me that the money is being delivered exactly as council has requested that it be delivered. That's an amazing result—helping to fix our potholed roads and saving ratepayers money. Yes, we've allocated $40 million to Shoalhaven City Council to fix local roads, and we've tailored the delivery to best suit the needs of the council—simple as that. There are $40 million for local Shoalhaven roads, a completed Nowra Bridge and $97 million to get the Nowra bypass going, and that's just the start.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's $752 million in federal funding for the Milton Ulladulla bypass, $100 million in federal funding for the Jervis Bay flyover, $400 million in federal funding for further upgrades to the Princes Highway, the Far North Collector Road—and the list goes on. These projects will not only provide a significant boost to our local and New South Wales South Coast infrastructure and help our community grow but also keep residents and tourists safe and comfortable as they drive around our beautiful region.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the state level, Labor also delivers. Last week I joined Dr Michael Holland, who made a commitment that, under a Minns Labor government, there will be $1.5 million to improve the Tuross Head turn-off from the Princes Highway, a dangerous intersection that has long been neglected. Further north, South Coast candidate Liza Butler has been working tirelessly to address gaping holes left by years of Liberal Party neglect. Liza was integral in securing $12 million in state funding under a Minns Labor government for the much-needed East Nowra sub arterial road. This road will alleviate congestion for commuters and tourists alike—something the community has been crying out for.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">State and federal Labor understands the needs of our communities and is committed to achieving them. The Albanese Labor government is ensuring that Commonwealth infrastructure spending is responsible, affordable and sustainable. Labor's investments in infrastructure will not only improve the lives of local people but also create jobs and economic growth for the whole country. It's a sensible and pragmatic plan for the future, and I'm proud to be delivering it.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="299623" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr SCAMPS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mackellar</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:45</span>):  I rise to express my deep frustration and my anger on behalf of the people of Mackellar. We have a major arterial road in my electorate, the Wakehurst Parkway, that has been a cause of deep anger and frustration for the people of Mackellar for at least a couple of decades now. To put it mildly, we are fed up with the lack of action from successive governments, both state and federal, Liberal and Labor, that has happened repeatedly over decades. Our repeated calls and pleas by our community for this road to be upgraded have been ignored over and over again—firstly as a safe Liberal seat, and now because the Labor Party understand that this seat, in all likelihood, will never be one of theirs. We are not a priority. We are angry and we are fed up. Lives are at risk.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The northern part of the Northern Beaches is a narrow peninsula, so there are only a couple of options to commute to the city. For thousands, the Wakehurst Parkway is the only direct route to the city, Chatswood and the local hospital. This road winds its way through a forested valley. It crosses a river, and it is one lane each way and extremely narrow and dangerous in parts. Lives have been lost on this road.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This road is critical to the people of the Northern Beaches for a number of reasons. Firstly, it is a major artery for commuters to the city and to other urban areas. It is typically very congested during peak hour times, and it is used by thousands of people to get to work during the week and to get to sports on the weekend. Secondly, and probably most importantly, it is the direct route that leads to the Northern Beaches Hospital. To go an alternate way would add at least 30 minutes to a trip. Thirdly, the New South Wales academy of sport is located halfway along this road and there is no other access to this sporting precinct other than by the Wakehurst Parkway. This is where athletes and teams, many elite, of all persuasions, train daily. It is their only access to the track, the swimming pool, the hockey fields, the football fields, the sport and rec camps, the head offices, the specialist sports medicine and physio facilities and the gym, amongst other things. Little Athletics is held there every Saturday. So it is entirely unacceptable that this road is closed due to flooding, on average, six to seven times a year—and sometimes for days on end. Again, lives are at risk because people's trips to the hospital are being extended in an untimely way.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The $75 million the federal government promised during the previous term, prior to the election, was cancelled in the last budget, in October last year. I have spoken to the minister for infrastructure twice in person now about this issue, to explain the urgency that is required to act on this road as it has been neglected for so long. I have also met with the New South Wales state minister and roads minister and shadow roads minister to explain the situation and request further funding to rectify the flooding issue. The New South Wales state government has allocated $75 million but that money has been allocated for other road safety issues on this road and will not be provided for flood mitigation. The council have offered to work on the land that is adjacent to the road, which is council land, to do flood mitigation work on that area, but they have a $13 million shortfall to be able to perform something which is acceptable to the community and doesn't destroy too much of the environment. A mere $13 million to reduce the flooding risk from six to seven times a year to just once or twice every two years—a massive difference for a small amount of money. It would otherwise cost over $600 million to raise the road. I say to you: this is something that is very worthwhile for the minimum amount of money.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Infrastructure Australia has recognised that this is a priority issue because it is for building resilience to climate change and because it is a major access road to the hospital. How many more lives must be lost for this government to act on what is a very important road in our community. And as I have said, people have been upset, frustrated and angry about this, and the lack of action on it, for decades. Thank you.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Agriculture is a vital industry in my electorate, but farmers are concerned about their place in a changing world. Climate change will inevitably impact agricultural productivity and profitability. At the same time, there's a lot of talk about agriculture playing a part in offsetting our nation's largest emissions under the government's safeguard mechanism. Our farmers currently generate 16 per cent of Australia's emissions. Right now, countries and groups around the world, like the European Union, are considering tariffs on Australian agricultural imports because we haven't done enough for a sustainable agricultural production. That's why today I'm presenting practical action for the government to support our farmers taking action on climate change.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">John Paul Murphy, a cattle farmer from Lurg in my electorate of Indi, told me that he feels, as an average farmer, he is treading water waiting to see what happens next. Recent accounting on his farm shows that 80 per cent of his farm's emissions are directly from methane. And John Paul knows that adopting new practices and offsetting methane will be critical for the future profitability and productivity of his farm. But he's concerned that farmers hastening quickly into the carbon market may ultimately be disadvantaged because they may need to offset their own emissions first. And many farmers I speak to across Indi, including John Paul, tell me that they want to play a part in reducing our national emissions and they're looking to become climate neutral themselves.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They talk to me about the challenges in navigating the carbon measurement, auditing and certification, and they express genuine concern about the integrity of carbon credits. Farmers have also told me that when there is an historical change in agriculture, farmers navigate that change through agricultural extension and farmer groups. A recent survey, released just last week by Farmers for Climate Action, of 600 farmers found that 94 per cent of respondents want to change their practices if it will benefit themselves and the environment, but 70 per cent of them had not been involved in any climate and agriculture extension program. Government has clearly fallen short in supporting our farmers in recent times, but we can change this. I'm bolstered by the government's $20 million Carbon Farming Outreach Program. The program intends to develop and deliver a training package and tools for farmers and land managers on carbon market participation and low-emissions technologies and practices. It's a good start, but it's nowhere near enough.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the lead-up to the last election, I called on the government to fully fund a network of 200 agricultural extension officers, based in 20 regional areas across Australia, over four years. I make this call again today. The Parliamentary Budget Office costed my policy at $132 million over four years. The government must significantly expand on their initial $20 million pledge if the support that farmers are calling for is to be actually delivered. Under my policy, the 200 extension officers would work with farmers one on one and through local agriculture and natural resource management groups to adopt the technology, the products and the practices that would help them lower their emissions, access carbon credits—for offsetting or insetting—and achieve net zero. These extension officers would translate the science into practice, delivering the research on how to improve soil carbon and accurately measure it or what nutritional additives need to be used to reduce methane emissions in livestock. The advice must be from trusted neutral, independent officers who know the specific environment that each farmer is working in, because the techniques applied in low-rainfall, poorer soils will be different to those in high-rainfall, organically rich soils.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When we're debating the Safeguard Mechanism (Crediting) Amendment Bill 2022 this week, I call on my fellow members to think practically about how offsetting will work, to think practically about how it will impact our agricultural sector, a sector that feeds and clothes us and cares for our beautiful natural landscapes. Agriculture is a foundational industry that enriches our nation. Let's not set up our farmers for failure. Let's listen to their calls for support to navigate the risks and gain the opportunities in the carbon market. The government has made some long-overdue first steps. Let's scale it up and deliver a robust, trusted network of extension officers to see it through.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Higgins</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:56</span>):  I thank the member for Indi for moving this motion. It's a very important one. The energy transition is Australia's moonshot moment, a window of opportunity to not only transition our country to a low-emission economy but revitalise our industrial base, with our cities and regions the beneficiaries. I had a glimpse of the future on a visit to Mt Gellibrand Wind Farm, just outside Geelong, recently. Operated by Spanish wind giant ACCIONA, 44 wind turbines are co-located on a sheep farm—climate action and agriculture in harmony. The blades were turning, and the only sound was the crunch of our footsteps on gravel and the baying of sheep and cattle. The wind farm has created 40 kilometres of access roads, enabling the farmer to move his gear and animals around, improving his productivity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The financial benefits of wind farms are enticing. With landlords earning between $5,000 and $7,000 per turbine, this tidy little earner has brought farms back from the brink, providing a buffer against the vagaries of climate or economic downturns. Wind farms have helped build resilience on multiple fronts—for our farmers, who are on the front line of climate change; for communities, who support these farms; and for the energy grid, which is retreating from coal. It is in no-one's interest to have people who know the land leave the land. After all, we can't eat iPhones. Wind farms are helping farmers stay put.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Aside from the environmental and economic benefits, there are cultural benefits of wind farms. When scoping the land, it is not uncommon to find ancient human remains or artefacts like stone tools. Companies work with local First Peoples and farmers to manage these scenarios without blocking economic progress. The juxtaposition of cutting-edge technology rooted in ancient land is striking. Remote sensing allows continuous monitoring in Spain, which enables workers to fix any issues that have arisen overnight. The whole operation is geared for efficiency.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sadly, this wind farm was delimited, like a fast car, to half its capacity, because of congestion in the grid. This is why the Albanese government is investing $20 billion in modernising our electricity grid so that renewable energy projects can operate at full capacity. We need the same communities who are benefiting from wind farms to support the build-out of transmission, or net zero will elude us. A diverse workforce is required to set up and operate wind farms, ranging from civil engineers to planners, IT specialists, electrical engineers, people with industrial ropes expertise and turbine blade repairers. I met workers who start at 7 am and clock off at 3 pm to pick up their kids and take them to after-school sport. This is a level of work-life balance many of these men have not experienced.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">'Australia is open for business' is what our Climate Change Act declared, but we have some catching up to do. In terms of installed wind energy capacity, in 2021, China leads the world with 329 gigawatts, then the US at 132 gigawatts, Germany at 63, India at 40, Spain and the UK at 27, and France at 18. Australia is currently at 11 gigawatts of capacity but has the potential, according to the Blue Economy CRC, to produce 2,233 gigawatts from offshore wind alone, far more than we need domestically, pointing to its huge export potential. Arguments for nuclear are blown offshore by wind.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The winds of change have started blowing since the Albanese government came to power. We announced the release of two offshore wind zones in the Bass Strait, off Gippsland, and in the Hunter as part of six proposed regions. In November last year, after a wasted decade, we announced that Australia was joining the Global Offshore Wind Alliance, which aims to achieve at least 380 gigawatts of global offshore wind capacity by 2030. This is no small feat, considering that the IEA expects that offshore wind capacity will need to exceed 2,000 gigawatts in 2050, from its mere 60 gigawatts right now, to limit a rise in temperatures to less then 1.5 degrees.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no getting to net zero without wind energy, and Australia has a box seat thanks to its natural endowments and policy certainty. But, like farmers who have sniffed the wind, we need communities to help us cut delays and support transmission so that we can turn wind into green electrons and greener dollars.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="265980" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms SHARKIE</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mayo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:01</span>):  I am very pleased to support this motion. The agriculture sector is incredibly important. It's an economic contributor to Australia and it is the lifeblood of our regional towns. Australian agriculture accounts for an astonishing 55 per cent of goods and services exported, 2.4 per cent of value-added GDP and 2.4 per cent of employment. The sector continues to thrive despite the often destructive nature of Australia's climate variability. As Dorothea Mackellar so aptly wrote, we are a country of droughts and of flooding rains, and we're also a country of bushfires.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's important to note that our continued success in the agriculture sector is not a product of chance. It's a product of hard work, undertaken over generations that have respected the land and incorporated good environmental practices as our knowledge and awareness has grown. This hard work and dedication on the land only tells part of the story. Science and application of scientific research has ensured tremendous year-on-year improvements in every aspect of agricultural production. The member for Indi's call on government to fund a network of 200 context-specific extension officers to provide outreach into our services and advice on technology, products and practices that will help farmers lower their emissions is sensible, and we know from experience that this will be successful. Australia already has lower emissions per unit of beef produced than our other major competitors, such as Argentina, Brazil, India and others. Our herd management, tree planting and other practices have assisted farmers to achieve this. However, our emissions intensity for our beef still remains higher than in the EU, US, Canada and New Zealand.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The good news, like our continued crop-yield improvements, is that the investment in science through public-private partnerships is funding solutions. One solution is FutureFeed's use of a specific type of red seaweed known as asparagopsis as a feed supplement that significantly reduces methane emissions. Feed lot trials in beef cattle using less than one per cent of asparagopsis show a reduction in methane production by more than 95 per cent. That's extraordinary. That is huge. As a side note, this native seaweed is a reminder as to why we need to make sure that we ensure our marine environments are pristine. Irresponsible destruction of those marine ecosystems will deny future opportunities. Everything is interlinked.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The importance of science assisting farmers to transition to lower emissions practice is essential, and it is not limited to preharvest treatments. In the parliament last year, I was pleased to negotiate funding for a post-harvest treatment plant for South Australia, and I look forward to the government working with the state government and the industry to complete the project. This plant will dramatically reduce product spoilage and consequential waste, minimise pesticide and other chemical use, and open markets to countries that we've never before been able to get our products into.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the emissions front, the Australian farm sector averages 14 to 16 per cent of our national greenhouse gas emissions. This is slightly above the global average of around 13 per cent. Community expectations, trading obligations and climate variability will continue to put pressure on Australia's farmers to reduce their emissions and their carbon footprint.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In this context the government must contribute and provide assistance, and I support the member for Indi's motion here. I think we need to work side by side with farmers, and this motion seems to me to be incredibly sensible. The spend will be very good value for money and it will put more professional jobs in our regions, as well. Many of our farmers are at a real crossroads. They're not sure where to go and what to do with respect to future farming and emissions. I would encourage the government to work with the member for Indi on this motion. Let's make this a reality.</span>

It is always important that we stand in this place and discuss the impact of climate change on our farmers and agriculture and the work that is happening. Many industries are impacted by climate change, but our farmers and agriculture are at the very top of the list. This isn't new; it's an issue that farmers have been raising for years. They have many action groups that come to this place and don't just lobby us but also present us with really practical solutions.</span>

I acknowledge that not all farmers are there yet. Some of them are a bit sceptical; they like the old ways. They still burn the old wheat crop after Anzac Day because that's what they've always done, despite the fact that their neighbours might be doing something very different. What we do know is that, at the grassroots, farmers have been leading action, but they can't do it alone. They need a partner in federal government and in this parliament to achieve more.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our farmers are leading the way in adapting to climate change through improvement in soil management, drought preparedness, the uptake of new technologies—which many are doing—cropping and livestock diversification. I have many examples in my own electorate of how that is happening, as many of us in regional electorates do. Farmers are always quite proud to share what they're doing, but what I really respect about our farmers is that they have a task list for us to tell us what else we could do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not just from those personal experiences that we know it's getting harder for our farmers. Recent government modelling shows that the profitability of farms, due to seasonal climate condition changes, is affecting farms and reducing profitability by about 23 per cent, on average. It is putting a lot of impact on farmers and their ability to produce and ensure their farms remain profitable. In my own electorate, and in big part of regional Victoria, the rain event that we had last October reduced what was promising to be a very high-yielding wheat crop. A lot of the crop was downgraded because of the impact of that one big flood event. That's something that you don't always budget for when you plant it in the ground, but, as more and more farmers say, we now have to factor that in when we're pricing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government is working with the sector to help reduce its exposure to climate change. Many farmers are relieved by the result of the last federal election because they feel they now have a voice in Canberra and a government that is working with them. Already, in our first year of being in government, we've allocated $420 million through the Future Drought Fund to support farmers and the agriculture sector to build resilience to mitigate risk of drought and climate change.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst we've had a very wet couple of years in Victoria, we know it dries very quickly because of the impact of climate change, and that next drought is just around the corner. We can no longer talk about it just being a millennium drought if it starts to happen every decade or every two decades, and that's something that our farmers are quite aware of. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A further $300 million has been delivered through our 15 rural research and development corporations. Whilst they have always had a very interesting history with this parliament, we know that these industry levies and joint federal funding can lead to real innovation and technology and development. I know that many in the sector, whilst they might have their challenges with their industry RDCs, are keen to be involved in how they can be improved into the future. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Carbon markets in agriculture and the net zero economy are critical. We've already seen this parliament and this government start to address that in many ways, and there is more work that can be done. Our farmers are helping to lead the way in how we can better carbon-farm, whether it be dedicating parts of their land to planting more trees or restoring country. I know from lots of farmers in my electorate they're very keen to work with First Nations as well as the government in restoring country—another way that we can help meet net zero by 2050. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's so much more I could say, but my time is at an end. In this government, we do have a partnership with agriculture and with our farming community. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">(4) further notes that Australia's international partners have taken or are taking steps to categorise the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a terrorist organisation, including the United States of America and the United Kingdom; and</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">In so doing, I call on the government to urgently take the necessary steps to formally categorise the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, the IRGC, as an organisation involved in supporting and facilitating terrorism. In my former role as the Minister for Home Affairs, I oversaw the listing of the entirety of Hamas, The Base and Hezbollah as terrorist organisations. It's a powerful signal to those who threaten our way of life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Like many others, I have been alarmed at how the threat from the IRGC has escalated over the past nine months, especially since the civil unrest following the death of Jina Amini in September last year. As this motion outlines, the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee inquiry into the human rights implications of recent violence in Iran heard many cases of human rights abuses by the IRGC as well as threats to the Australian-Iranian community. In fact, such is the degree of fear over repercussions for speaking out that the vast majority of the 893 submissions to the Senate committee are either name withheld or confidential. As one of the confidential submissions from a female Iranian-Australian says: </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">This submission is confidential as I have concerns regarding the wellbeing of my family members who are still living in Iran. The Islamic Republic of Iran has a well-known history of harassing, arresting and torturing family members of any Iranians who dare criticise the brutality of the regime.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There isn't time in this debate to go through the litany of publicly reported human rights abuses, including violent crackdowns on protesters, political executions, menacing harassment and even the reported poisoning of women and girls who dared to attend schools. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've spoken with many people who have an intimate knowledge of the conduct of the IRGC and the threats made to families here in Australia, including Peter Murphy, who runs Australian Supporters of Democracy in Iran, and the Melbourne for Iran group and the Iranian Women's Association of Australia, whom I met on a visit to my colleague the member for Menzies's electorate. I also spoke with Ms Dowlat Nowrouzi, a director of the National Council of Resistance of Iran, who had to flee the country when she was a teenager and now lives in Europe. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These groups all raised similar and deeply concerning viewpoints, which I believe this government must heed. As one of the submissions to the Senate inquiry said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">This is an opportunity for a country like Australia that respects human rights to support the oppressed and persecuted in Iran. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Importantly, this organisation is not just a remote threat, given the Australian Signals Directorate confirmed to the parliament last year that IRGC affiliated actors have targeted Australian organisations with ransomware attacks. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In its submission to the Senate inquiry, the Department of Home Affairs said it was aware of reports that pro-Iranian government informants are surveilling former Iranian residents protesting against the regime in Australia and threatening their relatives in Iran. Yet, literally at the last minute, the Attorney-General's Department also made a submission saying:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The Attorney-General's Department is of the view that, as an organ of a nation state, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps is not the kind of entity that is covered by the terrorist organisation provision in the Criminal Code. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Executive Council of Australian Jewry co-CEO Peter Wertheim described the AGD's legalise as 'disappointing' and the legal excuses as 'flimsy'. He said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">While an entire organisation or its government cannot constitute a terrorist organisation under Australian law, there is no reason why a discrete agency of a government, with its own constitution and organisational structure, cannot be designated as such. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm deeply concerned that the Attorney-General appears to be putting important national security considerations effectively in the too-hard basket. But I do welcome the fact that foreign minister Penny Wong as recently as this morning announced the imposition of additional action through Magnitsky-style sanctions on Iranians individuals and entities, and these include those within the IRGC. The foreign minister claimed the government would employ every strategy at our disposal towards upholding human rights, and I encourage the government to make sure that they do and that that goes much further than simply sanctions against individuals. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bruce</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:17</span>):  I am pleased to add my voice to the condemnation by this parliament and, indeed, by the Australian government of the Iranian regime. I am in awe of the courage of the Iranian people, standing up for democracy and human rights, often at grave risk to their own lives and livelihood and those of their families, despite the direct threats. The regime's disregard for human rights or human life is shocking to all decent Australians and the civilised world. Nowruz, the Iranian new year, which has been celebrated for 3,000 years as it's the ancient Persian new year, is tomorrow. It's a huge event in my community for people from Iran and Afghanistan. It's a day and a time of celebration, but I know, for so many in the diaspora community in Australia, it's also a time of deep worry and concern for their family and friends in Iran and Afghanistan. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to tackle head-on the hypocrisy of the opposition. I'm very fond of the member for McPherson—I shouldn't say that; it might wreck our reputations—on a personal level. But this is a sad and desperate politicisation by the opposition of this appalling situation in Iran. Let's be clear: the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps is a malignant actor. They're a threat to the Iranian people and to peace in the region and, as you rightly pointed out, to the world, through their cyberactivities and elsewhere. But for 10 years the Liberals did nothing on Iran. They failed to do anything. I put to the House: which was the last government until now that did anything on Iran? Was it the Morrison government, the Turnbull government, the Abbott government? No, it was the Gillard government, in 2010. You do not have a monopoly on the morality of this situation; indeed, your record condemns you. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There was 10 years of nothing, no sanctions. It was those opposite who sat by, said nothing and did nothing, while Iran was voted on to the UN Commission on the Status of Women. Penny Wong was the foreign minister and has been at the forefront of moves to kick them off that commission. It was the Gillard government that imposed broad based sanctions. This is the opposition's special party trick; they don't have any policies, but they have this one party trick that they do: they call for actions that they failed to take for 10 years. But now they're engaged in this tawdry partisan exercise to incite the Iranian diaspora in Australia, hoping to scrounge a few votes in a few seats—we know where they are—by calling for something that they know perfectly well is not going to happen. It's a good trick. In one sense, I'm doing exactly what you want by making this speech. But to list the IRGC under the Australian Criminal Code as a terrorist organisation, as the Attorney-General's Department has said, is not going to happen, because terrorist listings under the Criminal Code apply to non-state actors, not state actors like the IRGC. The opposition well know this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But I'll go a little further. This is my view. I've said it before. I've said it in the intelligence and security committee, which we both sit on, and I've said it externally. In your words, the listing of such would be a 'powerful signal'. They were your words. The listings here have almost no practical effect. They are symbolic. Politicians for decades have danced around and listed things as terrorist organisations in a way that has little to no practical effect in the real world. I'm sure al-Shabaab in Somalia are deeply terrified that they've been listed as a terrorist organisation! The things which hurt these people are the sanctions that matter, the things that Labor did when last in government and that Labor's doing now: financial sanctions, broad-based sanctions and targeted Magnitsky sanctions like those the government has consistently imposed. Sanctions were imposed last year on six individuals and two entities, including Iran's famed morality police; in February, sanctions were imposed on one entity and 16 people, including senior officials; and today 14 individuals and 14 entities have been made subject to financial sanctions, with the individuals also subject to travel bans. That's the stuff that actually makes a difference and matters, not stunts like this.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've imposed targeted sanctions, with partners, on people and individuals selling Iranian drones to Russia to kill people in Ukraine. We've been muscling up to the Iranian regime generally, with diplomatic pressure—through written correspondence, calling in the ambassador and having our ambassador see the government in Iran—and along with the international community. We've co-sponsored the independent Human Rights Commission investigation into human rights violations and, as I said, moved to kick Iran off the Commission on the Status of Women.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All of a sudden, we see the Liberals' new-found interest in human rights in Iran, after 10 years of doing nothing and sitting quietly by. It is appalling. They were on the body that could have acted for the last 10 years, but they did nothing, and we're not going to be lectured to by them.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fisher</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:22</span>):  I rise to join the member for McPherson in support of this motion, and I acknowledge her strong leadership in this area and the work that she did as the previous home affairs minister. I also commend the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee chair, Senator Claire Chandler, for her work in this space.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Whereas the Iranian Army functions to protect Iran's sovereignty and defence, the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps essentially exists to preserve the ayatollah's theocratic regime and to defend the ideology of the first ayatollah, which is deeply entrenched in the function and philosophy of the so-called Islamic republic. In the words of their own constitution:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The Revolutionary Guards is an institution under the Leader's supreme command. Its goal is to protect Iran's Islamic Revolution and its achievements and persistently struggle to achieve the divine aims, spread the … law of God …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the same supreme leader who has pledged to annihilate the State of Israel, who denies the Holocaust, who authorises the torture and murder of those who practise other religions, and who empowers law enforcement to slay women on the streets of Tehran for what they wear and what they say. Make no mistake: the IRGC is a threat to women; it is threat to a Christians, Jews and minority groups even within Islam in the nation of Iran; it is a threat to the democratic and egalitarian people of Israel; it is a threat to human rights defenders, advocates and whistleblowers; it is a threat to democracy and Western democratic ideals; and, most pertinently for us in this place, it is a threat to Australians and our national interests both at home and abroad.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my role as the Deputy Chair of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, I've joined with colleagues from across the political aisle in listing groups as terrorist organisations on a number of occasions: Neo-Nazi and white supremacist groups, radical Islamic extremists and self-proclaimed caliphates. These are people who deal in violence and fear and the most heinous evils. They often do it under the guise of religion, patriotism or ideological purity. Here we have a primary branch of the nation's armed forces perpetrating terror, dealing in organised crime and smuggling, and connected with persons and groups aiding terror through financial and material support. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As brave Australian academic Dr Kylie Moore-Gilbert states:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">The IRGC has a stated policy of 'exporting the revolution' beyond Iran's borders, and this has led to its sponsorship of a number of Islamist proxies in other parts of the Middle East, many of which have been designated terror organisations by Australia and its Western allies.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Listing the IRGC as a terror group, just as our UK and US allies have, would enable Australia's brave law enforcement agencies to prohibit Australians and residents from sending funds or material support to the IRGC, allow the refusal of entry to IRGC members, collaborators and co-conspirators, and position Australia to better counter the threat of Iran's exported extremism alongside allies. It would send a very clear message to those of like mind that we will not tolerate the indignity and inhumanity of the IRGC, of terror, of anti-Semitism, of religious persecution and of gender based violence. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Bruce spoke earlier about why we hadn't done anything to date. I can tell the member for Bruce this. If the Department of Attorney-General's advice is that the current law does not permit this government to list the IRGC, we'll work with the government to amend the Criminal Code to enable them to make that listing. We are standing with the government, offering constructive feedback. We'll work with them. The ball is now in the government's court.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The shadow minister for home affairs and we as an opposition will work with them to make whatever necessary changes to the legislation are required to list the IRGC as a terrorist organisation. I call on the government to do just that. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moreton</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:27</span>):  In 1876 the French philosopher Emile Boirac used a term in his book <span style="font-style:italic;">L'Avenuir des Sciences P</span><span style="font-style:italic;">s</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ychiques</span> that is now used every day internationally: deja vu. It's a French loan word for the phenomenon of feeling as though one has lived through the present situation before. It's an illusion of memory. For those listening in experiencing that strong sense of recollection right now, I can assure you that even though the coalition is only 10 months into their stint in opposition, that deja vu feeling you're feeling is not a neurological illness. Every Monday, without fail, when we come into this House, we see those opposite feign a passionate interest in an issue that they'd ignored for a decade in government. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's very disappointing that there are politicians today exploiting the horrible times in Iran for their own political purposes. Over their last decade in office, the former Liberal-National government did not impose one single solitary sanction on anyone in the Iranian regime. Nobody, not one—nada, zip, zero. That conga line of Abbott, Turnbull, Morrison governments did nothing and said nothing when they were on the international body that elected Iran to the Commission on the Status of Women. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When the Liberals and Nationals were in government they were so concerned about Iran's treatment of women they sat back and let them be a part of the Commission on the Status of Women. Some selected self-muzzling by the former foreign minister Bishop—and I'm sure you know which bishop I mean: the one who became a champion for the sisterhood the moment she walked out of the cabinet door in her red shoes, when she had less power. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unlike the Liberal-National government, the Albanese Labor government has taken stronger action against Iran on human rights than any previous Australian government. We stand with the people of Iran as they courageously demand full respect for their human rights, despite the dark and systemic threats against them, threats that continue in Australia. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Iranian regime's flagrant and widespread disregard for the human rights of its own people has appalled all Australians, and we're holding perpetrators to account. From the beginning of this wave of crackdowns, we've worked strategically to build pressure internationally on Iran. We're at the forefront of efforts to remove Iran from the Commission on the Status of Women. The LNP sat on their hands or stood in their red heels and let this happen in the first place. Australia co-sponsored and advocated for the successful Human Rights Council resolution establishing an independent investigation into human rights violations in Iran. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year, the Albanese government imposed Magnitsky-style human rights sanctions on six individuals and two entities, including Iran's morality police, over their involvement in the Iranian regime's abhorrent, flagrant and continued human rights violations. In February we announced additional Magnitsky-style sanctions on 16 Iranian individuals and one Iranian entity, including senior Iranian law enforcement and military officials. And today Minister Wong imposed sanctions and travel bans on a further 14 Iranian entities for egregious human rights abuses in Iran. We've also joined partners to impose targeted sanctions on multiple individuals and entities involved in the production and supply of drones to Russia that have been used in its illegal and immoral invasion of Ukraine. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government has consistently and forcefully raised concerns directly with Iran. The foreign minister and Attorney-General have written to and engaged with their Iranian counterparts. We've summoned their representatives in Australia on several occasions. Our ambassadors have made representations in Tehran, including directly to the deputy foreign minister, and we've called out Iran internationally, jointly with partners and in multinational forums—all the skills of diplomacy—most recently at the Human Rights Council in Geneva, where Assistant Foreign Minister Watts condemned Iran's brutal repression of protesters and its ongoing systemic discrimination against women and girls. The Albanese government is working deliberately and strategically to apply pressure on the Iranian regime. That includes the commission that the foreign minister Penny Wong has since worked determinedly and successfully to get Iran removed from. Also, Foreign Minister Wong, I hope you recover from your COVID soon.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst I know the mover of the motion before the chamber well, love her work in many areas and have worked with her over the years in parliament, I don't think that this motion reflects the last 10 years of inaction. The last government to put sanctions on the IRGC wasn't the Morrison government, the Turnbull government or the Abbott government. It was actually the Gillard government that last recognised the threat they presented and put broad based sanctions on them back in 2010. This is an opposition that specialises in calling for action that it actually failed to take.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyne</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:32</span>):  I rise in support of this motion, and I'd like to thank the members for Moreton, McPherson and Fisher for their comments thus far. We don't want to do a tit-for-tat discussion. The member for Moreton has just outlined the actions of the current government, and I'm very pleased they've done that. I acknowledge that work. I stood at the table myself and introduced the Autonomous Sanctions Amendment (Magnitsky-style and Other Thematic Sanctions) Bill to this House, and I was very keen to get some action happening utilising that legislation. But that is history now; we're dealing with the present.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We're dealing with, at this juncture in the state of Iran, the bravery of hundreds of thousands of their citizens who are in the latest round of popular protest against the Iranian theocracy and in particular the work of the Iranian revolutionary guard, which have acted maliciously since they first came onto the scene at the creation of the current state of Iran back in 1979. Onwards since then, they have kept the lid on any skerrick of departure from an Islamic theocratic state.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The most recent round of popular protest, triggered by Mahsa Amini for not wearing her hijab correctly, is the last of many. Back in 2017, there were popular protests, with 100 cities demonstrating, 25 deaths and 4,000 arrests. A very prominent young activist, Navid Afkari, got a bit of attention when he was finally hanged because of those protests back in 2020. In November 2019, there was a similar wave of popular uprising against the loss of human rights and the rigid imposition of the religious and morality police. An estimated 1,500 died in those two weeks. Then, since September 2022, protests have risen to the fore. Former Iranian citizens are living in many countries, and the sight of children being killed in indiscriminate violence during these protests, and people being arrested and prescribed a death sentence under the auspices of the so-called justice system, is an offence to the whole human race.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just recently, the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee received almost 900 submissions to its inquiry into the human rights implications of recent violence in Iran. The vast majority of the submissions were confidential and anonymous, and that is because members of the IRGC are active in many countries outside of Iran. The Belgians caught an Iranian diplomat planning a terrorist act in Paris during one of the rallies a couple of years ago, and many people are aware that Iranian actors have attended universities and received support from their country. The recommendations in the committee's report are substantial. I fully support the concept of listing the IRGC as a terrorist organisation. The legalities outlined by the honourable minister are noted, but, like the member for Fisher said, if that's the case, we just need to get together and change the legislation so we can list it. America has managed to list it, the European Parliament has achieved this and the UK is in the same situation. It would mean funds couldn't be sent to Iran to support the malignant theocracy that suppresses anyone who doesn't observe 'modesty' or follow the religious and social rules that are pressed upon them—whether they are a child, a woman or a man. It would be a good thing if we looked seriously at legislative change so that we could list the IRGC.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the main thing that we have to address is that this is an unjustifiable system of oppression of all the basic human rights. It's not just that it is pro-Islam, but, whether you are Christian, Jewish, Zoroastrian or whatever religion, if you are not following the strict diktats of how the Islamic revolutionary guard interprets things, your life is at risk—and this should stop. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Spence</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:37</span>):  On Mondays, you'll often find me in the Federation Chamber speaking on private members' motions, the subject matter of those motions varying wildly from sitting week to sitting week. However, I'm pleased that the motion moved by the member for McPherson is being debated on the floor of the House instead. This, I feel, is mainly due to the subject matter of this debate. It's a very serious motion touching on a serious subject matter—namely, Australia's foreign policy and our relationship with Iran in light of the violence occurring in that country, particularly since September 2022, in the aftermath of the death of a young woman who had her whole life ahead of her. This woman's name was Mahsa Amini, or Jina, which was her Kurdish name. Her tragic death occurred after she was taken into custody by the morality police in Iran.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for McPherson's motion notes the report tabled by the Senate Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade References Committee. Many of the submissions to the committee's inquiry are quite heartbreaking. I feel deeply for those directly and indirectly affected by the present situation in Iran. How could we not all feel this way? I feel deeply for the Iranian diaspora in Australia having to hear about this on the news or from loved ones in Iran itself. Many reside in my electorate of Spence. They are worried about their loved ones. This is as true for many in Australia who have left Iran recently as it is for those whose families had done so generations before them—whether they are of the Baha'i faith, whether they are Kurdish or whether they are here or abroad, there's a sickening feeling, but it is one that was amplified by recent events. It is a feeling that lingers because it is, sadly, not a surprise to many to hear that women were taken off the streets in Iran by the morality police for a wide number of perceived infractions long before that fateful day in September 2022. It is no surprise to anyone listening to know the reports of persecuted minority groups in Iran on the suppression of rights we in Australia consider basic, despite how fundamental they may be. I must say it's a marvel of our parliamentary committee system that so many out there had faith they could participate in a process such as this without fear.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">However, the report itself provides me with pause for thought and concern too. I must admit I am new to this place. Elected just last year, I have been a member of parliament for much less time than the mover of this motion, the member for McPherson, and even that of the chair of the committee, Senator Chandler. Notwithstanding this, I was always given the strong impression that on matters such as national security, defence and foreign policy a strong degree of bipartisanship is maintained. This helps to maintain continuity, strength and certainty to nations abroad, friend or otherwise, that Australia will not veer wildly in a different direction on the international geopolitical stage depending on which party forms the government of the day. It has served as well for many years now. The recent AUKUS announcement is a testament to the convention being applied in the area of defence and national security. This process, if conducted whilst following usual conventions, would see government and opposition, in fact all members of the committee, consulted as to the final recommendations made in the report. This was not the case. Sadly, as the Labor senators have noted, we do not see a conventional approach in this committee report.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite when in government trashed conventions at the highest level. I hope they don't go down a similar path in opposition too. The member for McPherson knows all too well the impact not following conventions can have on our democratic system and our image abroad, I would take it from the member's comments upon hearing how the member for Cook trashed our conventions and made himself Minister for Home Affairs at the same time she held that office, stating that she believed he ought to resign from the parliament. I thought there'd be a similar sense of outrage from the member when other conventions are thrown out the door as well. I hope in the future we can begin to see a clearer manifestation of His Majesty's loyal opposition, one that holds the government to account as good oppositions do, but in a constructive way that doesn't undermine the government as an enduring institution on the world stage. Whilst those opposite can spend time examining our tactics, the Albanese government will continue to examine ways and means to hold the Iranian government to account.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Menzies</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:42</span>):  I fully support the member for McPherson's motion, and I do so having listened to the speeches given by those opposite. For many months I have stood in front of the Iranian diaspora at many rallies and said we want this to be nonpartisan, and where there was progression on this issue, such as the removal of the regime from the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women, we praised you for it. Where there were limited and targeted sanctions, we praised you for them. So we don't come in here with this motion lightly. Yes, there is a convention that national security and foreign affairs is a largely bipartisan thing, but that is not a blank cheque for everything. It reeks of hypocrisy to hear that from those opposite, when you say that on the one hand, yet we've seen the Minister for Defence come in here and hurl abuse at this side for our decisions and our policies on national security and defence. So you will forgive me and forgive us for noting the hypocrisy. We will stand up for the Iranian diaspora in Australia. We hope to do it in a bipartisan way, but when that doesn't occur we will hold you to account. That is our duty as members of this place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Two nights ago I had the fortune of speaking at a dinner in Melbourne. That dinner was put on by members of the Iranian diaspora who work at the medical profession. In attendance was Kylie Moore-Gilbert and a member of the Labor Party. It had bipartisan support, and that's the way it should be. When speaking to that room, I acknowledged their concerns and their courage. They were there to celebrate Nowruz, the Persian New Year, but did so with mixed emotions because they know it's hard to celebrate when your own home country has been devastated and terrorised like it has. This isn't a normal time, and we must recognise that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite pointed to the supposed lack of action over the last 10 years. That is irrelevant because it all changed with the killing of Mahsa Amini. We know that, those opposite know that, the Iranian diaspora knows that and the Islamic republic regime knows that. That is why they reacted like they did. That is why we saw the deaths of over 500 people. That is why tens of thousands are now in prison. That is terror in its purest form—terror over a people who deserve so much better.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my speech to that group I said I'm also new to politics, and I've noted that, when you're making decisions, you can walk through a values door. That's what drives you—principles of freedom and democracy, and serving other people. But you can also walk through a power door where you're driven by your own selfish needs, by the lust and seductiveness of power. This regime was a revolution in 1979 but they walked through the power door and they slammed it shut after them. Now that door is being banged on, by young Iranians, young women and young girls, and the regime is terrified—and they know it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When I speak to people in my seat of Menzies—and I have the largest Iranian diaspora in Australia, and I'm very proud of that and I'm proud of them—they tell me this is a unique moment in history, and they want to give it the best chance they can. So they're pleading with us, they're pleading with those opposite, to give it its best chance. When those opposite stand up here and say, 'Well, nothing happened in the last 10 years; shame on you,' that is sending a message that they don't acknowledge this is a unique moment in history. They don't acknowledge that this is a time for us to give more power for us to their arm, for us to support the young women, the young girls, who are standing up to bullets, getting imprisoned just for dancing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend the motion, and I commend my colleague in the Senate, Senator Claire Chandler, for the work she did in asking for this. We listened to the community and to those on the front line. On the eve of that report being handed down, the Attorney-General's Department presented the problem we have before us—a supposed problem in the Criminal Code. We accept that. But guess what? That's what we do in this place. We get to amend legislation. If it's not fit for purpose, we can change it. And the Criminal Code is not fit for purpose. You have our support to change it. It'll sail through this place and it will sail through the Senate. Work with us. Give more power to their arm. It's a unique moment in history, and they deserve our support.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Solomon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:48</span>):  I rise to speak to the human rights implications of recent violence in Iran. In doing so, reflecting on the previous speaker: every moment in time is unique. Whilst I appreciate he feels compelled to make the argument of his side, given their poor track record and given the large percentage of people of Iranian descent in his electorate, let's be real: if you aren't prepared to accept the lack of action by those opposite when they were in government, like this is all new, like the Revolutionary Guard is new and that its behaviour couldn't possibly have been predicted, then not taking those steps along the line is negligent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The previous speaker wasn't in the Abbott, Morrison or Turnbull governments. However, it's important not to whitewash history. It is not a partisan view; it is a bipartisan view that we have all been moved in this place by the bravery of the Iranian people and appalled by the brutality of the regime towards its own citizens as the violence has escalated. The people of Iran have not given up hope as they courageously demand full respect for their human rights despite those threats that are against them. So I think I can confidently say that, across the chamber, we stand with the people of Iran. Whilst Iranian security forces persist with draconian methods to ruthlessly suppress peaceful protesters, including the use of lethal force and senseless violence against women and children that is obviously absolutely abhorrent, I share the deep concerns of those in my community in Darwin and Palmerston and around the country. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Nothing can justify these shameful actions, which have included execution of protesters by the regime. Australia opposes the death penalty in all circumstances, for all people everywhere. We have been integral to building pressure on Iran internationally and were at the forefront of efforts to remove Iran from the Commission on the Status of Women. Australia advocated for the successful Human Rights Council resolution for the establishment of an independent fact-finding mission to investigate human rights violations in Iran, and the Australian government has consistently and forcefully raised our concerns directly with Iran. Our government has summoned Iran's representative in Canberra on numerous occasions, and our ambassador has made representations in Tehran, including directly to the deputy foreign minister. These are concrete actions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia will continue to raise concerns directly with Iran's representative in Canberra, through our embassy in Tehran and in multilateral forums. We have called out Iran internationally, jointly, with partners and in those multilateral forums, most recently at the Human Rights Council in Geneva earlier this month, where Assistant Foreign Minister Watts condemned Iran's brutal repression of protesters and its ongoing systematic discrimination against women and girls. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government, the Albanese government, is working deliberately and strategically to apply pressure to the Iranian regime. We have imposed Magnitsky-style human rights sanctions on 22 individuals and three entities over their involvement in the Iranian regime's abhorrent, flagrant and continued human rights violations. Today the foreign minister announced Magnitsky-style human rights sanctions on 14 Iranian individuals and 14 Iranian entities over their involvement in the Iranian regime's abhorrent, flagrant and continued human rights violations. Among those subject to Magnitsky-style human rights sanctions are Iran's morality police, the Basij Resistance Force, and senior law enforcement and military figures, including those within the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps. The IRGC is a malignant actor that has long been a threat to international security and to its own people. The Gillard government understood this and put broad based sanctions on the IRGC as a whole in 2010. The Albanese government has also recognised the threat. </span>

This is a movement that started six months ago with the death of Mahsa Amini. This is the sizeable change that has happened in the last six months, with the deaths of Mahsa Amini and many others. The member for Menzies and I have sponsored political protesters who have been arrested, and people have been murdered, and there has been a significant change in the last six months.

When you hear the passion they have for their country, for their homeland, but also their anguish at loved ones and family members that are in jail or that they have lost, your heart breaks for them. They have such pride in their country, and it's important we continue to be their voice. </span>

At the time, our shadow ministers, Senator Simon Birmingham, Mrs Karen Andrews and Senator James Paterson, produced a media release calling for stronger support for the people of Iran, and I echo that. The violence and oppression in Iran require the strongest possible response from the Albanese government and other nations to send a clear message that these actions are not tolerated and must cease.</span>

We have been calling for this action for months, but at every step the Albanese government has been slow to act, leading to frustration and concern in the Iranian community. Last year, it was revealed by the Australian Signals Directorate that Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps affiliated actors have targeted Australian organisations.

                <span class="HPS-Small">… that the Australian Government take the necessary steps to formally categorise the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as an organisation involved in supporting and facilitating terrorism.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the report notes, the overwhelming response from submissions was that the government should take this important action to send a clear message and strong repudiation of their actions.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia has a moral obligation to take a strong stand against the IRI's abhorrent behaviour, but it also has an obligation to protect Australians against the dangerous and threatening behaviour of the IRI regime. The IRI regime is effectively a rogue state responsible for acts of terrorism, cybercrime, acts of violence against its critics, hostage diplomacy and other abhorrent behaviour. Australia cannot and should not have any pretence of maintaining a business-as-usual diplomatic relationship with such a regime.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I had the pleasure of meeting a local constituent in Casey, Dr Kylie Moore-Gilbert—who many know—who was taken hostage and imprisoned in Iran on the basis of politically motivated charges. It was powerful to hear her story firsthand. She made a very clear case to the committee as to why the IRGC should be listed as a terror organisation:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Listing the IRGC as a terror organisation would enable Australian law enforcement to prohibit anyone in Australia from sending funds or other support to the IRGC … It would also better enable Australia to deny visas to IRGC members, many of whom are known to have studied in Australian universities in the past, and to prevent IRGC members from gaining residency or citizenship.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition continues to offer bipartisan support for any action by Australia to implement the recommendations of the committee and strengthen the condemnation of the continued abuse of human rights being carried out by the Iranian regime. Australia must take a stance that is consistent with like-minded nations.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Sturt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:58</span>):  In the final moments of this debate, I would like to commend all the other contributions from speakers in the coalition and quickly highlight the plight of Mr Milad Armoun, in particular, a young gentleman who has now been convicted and sentenced to death by the Iranian regime. He is a very good example of why it is so important to support this motion and declare the IRGC a terrorist organisation. His human rights have been completely abused by the Iranian regime, and, as I mentioned, he awaits the death penalty in Iran as we speak. I have taken the step, as many members of parliament have, of taking a personal interest in one particular victim of this regime. Mr Milad Armoun is the one that I stand up for, but I know that many members of parliament in this chamber, and across the world, are standing up for the thousands of people who are, as we speak, facing injustice and abuse of their human rights in Iran. That is why it is so vital that we as a parliament have unity around the condemnation of the behaviour of the Iranian regime and the IRGC and, equally, take the step of declaring them to be a terrorist organisation.</span>

The agreement will build on Australia and Europe's natural partnership, rising out of a shared commitment to the rule of law, global norms, and free and open markets. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Russia's invasion of Ukraine has adversely impacted the global economy, with widespread energy, commodity and trade disruption. This is slowing global growth, alongside other factors such as tightening monetary policy to combat inflation in major economies and slowing economic growth in China. Interest rate hikes across major economies are placing additional pressures on emerging markets and developing economies, in addition to increasing inflation and negatively impacting household spending, and may lead to unrest and instability in vulnerable economies. That was the topic of much discussion. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia has imposed unprecedented and comprehensive sanctions against Russia and, to date, has provided $655 million in military and humanitarian assistance to Ukraine. Australia's response to Russia's illegal invasion was warmly welcomed by the EU and France. All our European allies expressed their appreciation of our commitment to free and democratic principles and to holding Russia to account. Australia and the EU are increasing cooperation in the Indo-Pacific region and enhancing security stability and good governance and improving coordination of development cooperation assistance among donors in the region. This is underpinned by the EU's strategy for cooperation in the Indo-Pacific and its commitment to Asia and Pacific countries to 2027, and its commitment under the Global Gateway initiative on connectivity in December 2021. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The EU-Australia Leaders meeting in the margins of the G20 Bali was an opportunity to strengthen collaboration in support of a free and open Indo-Pacific region and our shared goals for sustainable development. Colleagues in Europe expressed their concern over increasingly aggressive language from China in relation to Taiwan, and shared Australia's deepening concern on the rhetoric coming out of Beijing. On trade, many pointed to Australia's strong response to China's aggressive trade stance as a model of how to deal with similar attempts from China and Russia to intimidate European countries. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The EU is focused on climate action and welcomed the commitment of the new Australia Government re-engaging with the international community on action to tackle climate change. The 2020 European Green Deal is a set of policy initiatives by the European Commission with the aim of making the EU climate neutral by 2050. This involves sweeping legislative and regulatory initiatives for a cleaner environment, more affordable energy, smarter transport, new jobs and an overall better quality of life. Australian initiatives such as efforts to be a major green ammonia/hydrogen exporter has great potential to support Europe's plans for energy transition and security.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">European partners urged Australia to be ambitious in ramping up efforts across the economy to mitigate emissions. The Safeguard Mechanism that will require Australia's largest greenhouse gas emitters to keep their net emissions below an emissions limit, was cited as an example of the Europeans believing that Australia was taking meaningful action on climate change.</span>

I wish to thank the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade for the assistance provided to delegation members. In particular, I want to thank the officers located within the Australian embassy to Belgium and Luxembourg, led by Ambassador Caroline Millar; and the officers located within the Australian embassy to France, led by Ambassador Gillian Bird PSM. Thanks to the ambassadors for their briefings and hospitality. Finally, the delegation wishes to thank all those individuals who and organisations which met with us during our recent visit.</span>

Let's be clear: this is a bill that should never have been brought to this place. The contents of the bill are matters that every single member in this place, especially those in leadership positions, should have respected in the first place. The former Liberal Prime Minister turns out to be a man with many hats, a so-called jack of all trades but, as the Australian people know all too well, the master of none.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It was Simon Benson and Geoff Chambers' book <span style="font-style:italic;">Plague</span><span style="font-style:italic;">d</span> that first revealed the former Prime Minister's secret ministries. From their interviews, we discovered that between March 2020 and May 2021 the former Prime Minister, the member for Cook, still sitting in this chamber, was appointed by the Governor-General to administer not one, not two, not three but five additional secret portfolios. As the member for McPherson, the former Minister for Home Affairs, which was one of the departments the former Prime Minister appointed himself in charge of, said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This is totally unacceptable, for a prime minister to behave in this manner undermines everything that a federal government constitutionally should stand for.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I couldn't agree more.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To add insult to injury, just last week it was revealed in documents published under freedom of information laws that the former Prime Minister appointed his former assistant minister Ben Morton, no longer in this place, to administer the home affairs department in March 2021—a move not publicly disclosed at the time in the official ministry list or in a swearing-in ceremony. The secret promotion for Ben Morton was made two months before Morrison's controversial decision to appoint himself, and happened on the exact same day that former home affairs minister Karen Andrews was appointed to the ministry. Former minister Andrews blasted the member for Cook after discovering these new deceits by the former prime minister, and she said: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Given what we've heard, it's not surprising that I wasn't told about it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It's not okay to behave in the way the former prime minister and others have in relation to keeping information secret.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">'It's extraordinary,' she said. Well, that is the understatement of the year. Who knows what the reasoning was behind any of that.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It has also emerged that the member for Capricornia, a Nationals MP, was appointed to administer the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet at the same time and in the same manner as Ben Morton, in moves that were gazetted but not widely known—let's be honest—at that time. It begs the question: what more are we to find out? The secret, scheming grab for power beggars belief. It flies in the face of what a democratic government should stand for, and that is transparency, accountability and integrity, amongst other matters. The former prime minister's senior ministers were totally blindsided. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have every reason to believe the member for McPherson was genuinely devastated to hear the news of what had gone on behind her back. But so, too, were the Australian public. Following the expose of the former prime minister's secret ministries in mid-August last year, did the former prime minister apologise to the Australian people or his colleagues? No. He spent much of that night sitting at home, creating memes or commenting on Facebook jokes about his five secret ministry positions. It was all a big joke to him. Personally, I think that this undermining of our parliamentary system of government—of the whole Westminster system—and of our democratic traditions of accountability is no laughing matter. If the member for Cook thinks his behaviour is so funny, I suggest he resigns from this parliament immediately. Perhaps he should try his hand at being a comedian, but this parliament is not a sitcom. We're not here to play out that kind of despicable behaviour. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The people of Newcastle feel especially aggrieved by the former prime minister's decision to appoint himself on 15 April 2021 as the Minister for Industry, Science, Energy and Resources. We understand that the member for Cook did so because the then minister for resources, the current minister for Hinkler, apparently had no intention of rejecting the PEP-11 licence off the coast of New South Wales. Now, the PEP-11 issue—for those who don't understand acronyms, the petroleum exploration permit—has reared its ugly head again in my community as a direct result of the former prime minister's utter disregard for proper governance. What this shows is that the former prime minister understood from the get-go that he could take on specific extra portfolios and make determinations. He understood that by taking on those portfolios he could use his power and responsibilities against the wishes of his current ministers, who had been sworn in under those very portfolios. In doing so, he jeopardised due process and the entire functions of our system of government. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">His disregard for our democracy has been very costly for the Commonwealth, which has to fight battles in the Federal Court, and for the people in Australia and for my community of Newcastle, in particular, because it means now that the application for PEP-11 must be brought back for a decision by the joint Commonwealth-New South Wales authority. I share my community's frustration and anger that this issue was so grossly mishandled by the former prime minister. I can assure the people of Newcastle that there is only one Minister for Resources in this Albanese Labor Government, and she will be diligent in doing her job properly. That's what a responsible government does. I say unequivocally to my community that due process will be followed to deal with this matter once and for all.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While the public hearings for the Royal Commission into the Robodebt Scheme have now ceased, our nation remains aghast. Day after day, the robodebt royal commission outlined processes and practices of the former government that were both unethical and illegal. Let me repeat that—illegal. These were matters that brought untold suffering for hundreds of thousands of Australian people. The royal commission laid bare the former government's total disregard for its duty to the wellbeing of its citizens in using a flawed and dangerous mathematical algorithm to go after some of the most vulnerable in our community. A total of 764,000 Australians who had received welfare payments in the past were unlawfully accused of defrauding the government and slapped with robodebt notices. Of them, 348,000 Australians were subsequently notified there was an apparent discrepancy during the scheme and did not have the debt raised against them. However, the remaining 416,000 Australians were still issued unlawful robodebts after July 2017. That's hundreds of thousands of Australians, including many Novocastrians in my electorate of Newcastle, who had unlawful debts raised against them by the most powerful entity in Australia, the Commonwealth.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It went on for 4½ years. Let that sink in. Illegal practices with devastating consequences under the watch of the former government went on for 4½ years. If that government had heeded the repeated, numerous and now well documented warnings and stopped the robodebt scheme in its tracks, as it should have, 764,000 of our fellow Australians would not have been subjected to this stressful and unlawful behaviour by their own government. Not only did the Morrison government continue this illegal scheme for more than three years, until it was eventually stopped by a class action that started in November 2021; we know from evidence at the recent hearings of the royal commission that they were continuously dismissive of all those warnings I just spoke about. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We heard from the former cabinet minister and now member for Fadden, who sits in this parliament, on those benches opposite. The member for Fadden admitted that he made false statements in support of robodebt because—and this is going to floor most Australians—he wasn't permitted to tell the truth due to cabinet protocols. Rather than exercising ministerial agency and pushing back against an unlawful program, the then minister and now member for Fadden noted:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… you generally don't have the luxury of saying no.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Doesn't that give us every indication of the type of government that the member for Cook was running? What a terrifying state of affairs. The legacy of the Morrison government is in tatters. When you hear former ministers were more committed to shaking down vulnerable Australian citizens for unlawful debts than they were to standing up for them in their own cabinet room, it's no wonder the Australian people voted for change last May. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese Labor government has been fast to act on restoring integrity to the political system. Of course, we had the Bell inquiry. Following revelations of the former Prime Minister's secret ministries, the now Prime Minister and the Attorney-General announced the establishment of an inquiry into the appointment of the former Prime Minister to administer multiple departments, led by a former High Court justice, the Hon. Virginia Bell AC. Part of the recommendations of this review was to amend the Ministers of State Act to provide for greater transparency and accountability for Australia's system of government at the Commonwealth level.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's extraordinary that this new government had to call an inquiry and have a former High Court justice provide a recommendation to this parliament that we should ensure that all of the business we transact here or in the name of the Commonwealth should be aboveboard, lawful and filled with integrity and that we should be accountable to the Australian people. I would have thought that was a given. I think most members in this House would have thought that was a given. But these amendments are clearly necessary given what we now know about the former administration. These amendments that the Labor government is introducing are essential to restoring trust in government. They ensure that the Australian people are able to access information in relation to the composition of the Federal Executive Council, those who have been appointed to administer certain departments of state, and the high offices that ministers of state hold.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When the Albanese Labor government was elected, we knew we had a big job in front of us to restore the public's trust in government following almost a decade of mismanagement and rorts. Little did we know the extent of the chaos and dysfunction amongst the coalition ranks. Introducing this bill demonstrates this government's readiness to act promptly to restore the Australian people's confidence in our federal system of government and to rebuild integrity in the public sector, our institutions, our processes and our officials. It ensures that we have a system of government where there are checks and balances and where one person cannot again garner power without adequate and warranted accountability to the Australian people and the Australian parliament. This, I say, is the very least we can do. It is in the interests of all of us to restore public trust and confidence in our political institutions. The Australian people deserve nothing less than the very best from each and every one of us in this Australian parliament.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr GORMAN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Perth</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Assistant Minister to the Prime Minister</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:22</span>):  If you use ChatGPT in secret, you get kicked out of university. If you pass on team secrets to a bookie, you get kicked out of the team and sometimes kicked out of the sport. If you keep secrets from a royal commission, you get an adverse finding. But, if you secretly swear yourself into five portfolios, the parliamentary Liberal Party and National Party will rush to your defence in a partisan vote on censure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Every Australian should know that those opposite thought that the activities of the member for Cook were just fine. They stood up and defended his right to swear himself into secret ministries. They questioned it in the media—there were lots of questions in the media—but then, when it came to actually doing their job, how did they vote? The Liberal Party and the National Party made a decision in their party room to vote to protect the member for Cook. What they really did, though, was tell their constituents just how far the standards of the Liberal Party and the National Party have slipped over time. They told those in the gallery and the students who visit this place all of the time that this was okay and somehow was consistent with the parliamentary traditions which they seek to uphold—or, in this case, undermine.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Contrast that with the history of this place, because this is a debate about tradition and about how we uphold standards that have existed long before us and should exist for many, many decades afterwards. If you look to World War II, we had John Curtin holding special private sittings to share secrets with members, trusting every member, from all sides of the parliament. If you contrast the former member for Fremantle with the current member for Cook, you have one who saved us from invasion and one who separated us from information. It wasn't just that he didn't trust the parliament; he didn't trust his own colleagues. The fact that there were so few who were outraged—and I give credit to a number who did express their outrage at the time—shows just how far the standards have slipped in the Liberal Party and the National Party. I say that because, in the darkest days of the COVID pandemic, we had the member for Cook looking for what he could sign and what he could lock away in his safe so that he could 'fundamentally undermine' his own cabinet colleagues.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I didn't like the result of the 2019 election, but I respected it. I respected the decision that the Australian people made, but, clearly, the member for Cook did not. As Prime Minister, he set out, within months of that election, to dismantle centuries and centuries of Westminster tradition. No-one voted for secret ministries and no-one voted for absolute secret power with the Prime Minister. No-one thought that their local Liberal or National would allow this to happen, but they did. Every coalition member failed in their duty. They allowed a silent and secret insurgency here in Australia, and, while the ministries were kept secret, it is no secret that they were too gutless to condemn this behaviour. When it comes to the role of different people in this place, it is the job of those of us in this House to hold ministers to account. We were denied the opportunity to do that job. It is the job of journalists in the gallery to expose secrets. That's what they come here to do, and we give them an entire level of the building to do so. While we might not like it at times, our democracy is all the stronger for it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I give credit to the member for Cook for one thing. I give credit to him for sharing this secret with Simon Benson, but shouldn't he have told the parliament too? Shouldn't he have at least told the then health minister, the home affairs minister or even his Lodge-mate, the Treasurer? When he did tell one person, the member for Riverina, they should have refused to keep his dirty secrets. But we got one of the most pathetic excuses I have ever heard in my time in Australian politics. The former Prime Minister, the member for Cook, in explaining why he told nobody, said, 'No-one asked me,' as if the only time that the Australian people deserve a full and accurate answer from those in positions of power is a response to millimetre accurate questions from the media.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">At the same time that all of the secret ministries business was being shuffled in papers in the Prime Minister's office by the member for Cook, the member for Cook was quoting <span style="font-style:italic;">T</span><span style="font-style:italic;">he </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Croods</span> and telling Western Australians to 'get out of the cave'. It turns out that not only was he the secret minister for health at the time he was giving this lecture to Western Australians but he was also hiding in a cave himself. That is why this legislation is necessary. It's necessary because, based on the votes in this House in the 47th Parliament, we know that if we don't put this legislation through, this is how those opposite will want to behave again.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do want to give credit, though, to the member for McPherson for calling out just how ridiculous this was. She said, 'This undermines the integrity of government.' In reference to the member for Cook, she said, 'It is time for him to leave the parliament and look elsewhere for employment.' This may be advice that is still being considered. But it is amazing that, when you go and look for what you would think would be a few quotes from a few people who really stood up, you don't find that much. The silence tells you more than what has been said by the opposition spokespeople on this particular bill. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For Australians, this just goes so much against what they experience in their working life. I remember when I was 19 years old and working on both sides of the aisle, as they would say—I was working for McDonald's and Domino's Pizza, doing two jobs over the summer—I didn't hide it from anyone. The Australian Taxation Office knew. I disclosed it. It's important to be honest about these things, and that's what most Australians expect. That's what most Australians do when they have to interact with government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I note what was said by the member for Newcastle about the fact that we had the former government pursuing people for perceived secrets they had supposedly kept from Centrelink through the robodebt scandal—secrets that didn't even exist. They were happy to prosecute that while, at the same time, keeping secrets about how they were running the ministries of this nation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What gets very interesting is that this was a cultural problem in the Liberal and National parties. It was a cultural problem that was embodied by the former Prime Minister but wasn't exclusive to him. We learnt more last week about the other secret ministries. These are just the latest. They may be more. You never know when it comes to the bizarre breaching of conventions and traditions that has become a hallmark of the Liberal and National parties. We discovered last week that it wasn't just the member for Cook who was secretly appointed to ministries. Documents released under freedom of information revealed an insidious approach in the previous coalition government when it came to appointing ministers. We saw two assistant ministers secretly appointed to other portfolios, with no swearing-in ceremony, no public event, no changes to the public ministry lists and no advice to this chamber—just a breakdown in the trust on which democracy is based.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again I pay credit to the member for McPherson, who again was one of the only ones who had the integrity to speak out on this. The former Minister for Home Affairs said, 'Given what we've heard, it's not surprising I wasn't told about it,' because one of those secret assistant ministries was within her own portfolio. She said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">It's not OK to behave in the way the former prime minister and others have in relation to keeping information secret.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we're learning is that more and more on the opposition benches knew about these secrets but none of them ever had the guts to say it and tell the parliament how the government was actually being run.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would be interested to know if the now opposition leader knew about these secret appointments. He has been very quiet on these matters: 'Oh, look, you know, he probably won't do it again.' But there is no proper explanation from him about a government of which he was a senior minister. Indeed, he held many of the portfolios that would eventually be touched by the secret ministries scandal.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we know is that, when the now opposition leader was the Minister for Home Affairs, on 11 March 2021 wheels were being put in motion to give him a secret assistant minister—to put in place a secret assistant minister in the Home Affairs portfolio. There was a request from the office of the then Prime Minister, Scott Morrison, for the Hon. Ben Morton MP to administer the Department of Home Affairs. That was communicated on 11 March 2021. The now opposition leader was the minister at the time. If he knew, he should tell this parliament that he knew, and, if he didn't know, he should be as outraged as everyone else about these secret ministries. This parliament deserves an explanation from the now opposition leader about what he knew and what else he might know about the secret ministries and the secret assistant ministries that lived a large life in the secret administration of the Morrison government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We did see the opposition leader defend these actions. He thought it was basically wrong but excusable, which to me really just spells out a weak culture of leadership and governance and proves to the Australian people why the now opposition leader should never be put in a place where he holds executive power ever again. It basically tells the Australian people that outside the Leader of the Opposition's office hangs a big sign that says, 'Integrity optional.' In other words, the buck does not stop here when it comes to those opposite.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do give them credit, though. When they are forced to come into this place and vote on things, they will vote in favour of a protection racket for secret ministries, they will vote in favour of higher energy prices, they will vote in favour of stopping action on climate change and they will vote in favour of more debt by refusing to act on unsustainable measures in our superannuation system. But the only time the Australian people actually needed a 'no-alition' was when they started to find out about the secret ministries scandal, when one of them—just one of them—could have said no. They could have said to the Prime Minister at the time, the Hon. Scott Morrison, member for Cook, 'Mate, this is just not the way to run a government,' because it's not the way that government has ever been run in the past. It was without precedent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we've seen in the language from the now former Prime Minister is that he did go 'through a phase'. It was a trend at the time to claim 'fake news' from time to time, but in this action he did more than most in this place to undermine faith in our democracy. While he ran around saying 'fake news', he was secretly creating real news, real swearings-in to real positions, and creating a new secret service in Her Majesty's government of the Commonwealth of Australia.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am going to end with a story which I feel will have a good lesson for the member for Cook. He should read up on George Lazenby. Lazenby was born just down the road, in Goulburn. He spent his teenage years in Queanbeyan. As the Minister for Defence Personnel would say, many should follow his lead in his service in the Australian Army. But it wasn't service in the Army that turned out to be his true passion; it was acting, and he got his big acting break in 1968, the same year that the member for Cook was born. That big break made him, to this day, the only Australian to play James Bond. He played James Bond in a movie that many of us love, <span style="font-style:italic;">O</span><span style="font-style:italic;">n </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Her Majesty's Secret Service</span>. Yes, the title gives it away. Bond is secretly doing a mission without authorisation from MI6. Moneypenny secretly alters Bond's resignation paperwork without telling anyone. The head of SPECTRE is using brainwashed agents. Not telling anyone, secret paperwork, brainwashed ministers—sound familiar? But here's where Australia's James Bond, George Lazenby, got it right: he only played James Bond once. He only had one job, and he focused on doing that one job well.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm proud to be part of a government that is bringing integrity back to this matter; I'm proud that, when we found out about this outrageous breach of Westminster convention, it was referred for a proper, thorough inquiry; and I'm proud that we have acted by bringing this legislation, which I urge every member—whatever your political stripes—to vote for.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hunter</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:37</span>):  I rise to make contribution on the Ministers of State Amendment Bill 2022. This bill provides greater transparency and accountability in Commonwealth administration. It will ensure the Australian people are able to access information related to the make-up of the Federal Executive Council, those appointed to administer certain departments of state and the high offices that ministers of state hold. These reforms are a vital part of the government's response to the <span style="font-style:italic;">Report of the inquiry into the appointment of the former Prime Minister to administer multiple departments</span>, which was led by the former High Court justice the Hon. Virginia Bell AC.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I, like so many other Australians, was completely and utterly disgusted by the actions of the member for Cook. In August 2022, media reports began detailing that the former Prime Minister the member for Cook had appointed himself to administer multiple portfolios during the 2020 and 2021 period—namely as Minister for Health, Minister for Finance, Minister for Industry, Science, Energy and Resources, Treasurer and Minister for Home Affairs—on top of his appointment to administer the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. As a community we expect our leaders to uphold the highest standard of ethics and transparency. We trust them to act in the best interests of this country and its people. However, the actions of the member for Cook and former Prime Minister were a violation of this trust and a violation to the Australian people. It's not only a matter of legality but a matter of morality and integrity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The decision of the member for Cook and former prime minister to appoint himself in secret undermines the fundamental principles of democracy and fairness. It shows a complete disregard for the rule of law and the principle of accountability. We cannot accept this behaviour from our leaders. It's a betrayal of the trust we place in them. It damages the very fabric of our society. We need leaders who are committed to transparency and honesty, who put the needs of the people before their own personal interests. As a community we must hold our leaders accountable for their actions. We must demand that they uphold the highest standards of ethics and transparency. We must work together to ensure that our democracy is strong and resilient, and that it serves the best interests of all Australians. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We must unite in the condemnation of the member for Cook and former prime minister's actions, and let's demand that our leaders always act with integrity and in the best interests of our community and also every Australian. The disgraceful actions of the former prime minister and member for Cook have been condemned not just by the Australian public but by multiple former Liberal prime ministers. Former prime minister John Howard said: </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">This is sinister stuff. This is a secret government.… this is one of the most appalling things I have ever heard of in our federal government. I mean, the idea that a prime minister would be sworn int o other ministries, secretly, is incredible.</span>

In August last year the Prime Minister and the Attorney-General, the Hon. Mark Dreyfus, announced the appointment of a former High Court justice the Hon. Virginia Bell AC to lead the inquiry into the appointment of the former prime minister as the head of multiple departments. I need to state before those opposite start with their crocodile tears that this inquiry wasn't about politics. Instead, it was essentially an analysis into how and why this occurred, and, more importantly, it was an analysis of who knew about the events that transpired. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important, it is vital and it is crucial that we have integrity and that we have accountability and transparency in our system of government and the processes within it because our parliamentary democracy relies upon these conventions and relies upon the Westminster traditions of checks and balances. This was made abundantly clear by the Solicitor-General who said it is impossible for the parliament to hold ministers to account for the administration of departments if it does not know which ministers are responsible for those departments. The Ministers of State Amendment Bill 2022 forms one part of the government's response to Ms Bell's recommendations. Specifically, the bill will require the Official Secretary to the Governor-General to publish a notifiable instrument register of the federal registration of legislation, as soon as reasonably practicable, advising the Governor-General has chosen, summoned and sworn an executive councillor to the Federal Executive Council, appointed an officer to administer a department of state or directed a minister of state to hold an office. It will also require such notification of revoking any of these positions. A notifiable instrument will include the names of the persons, the department of state where appropriate, and the dates on which they were sworn, appointed or directed. In the case of revocations, the notifiable instrument is to include the name of the person, the name of the former officer and the date that such membership, appointment or direction was revoked. The notifiable instrument may also comprise of a copy of an instrument issued by the Governor-General. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill demonstrates the government's readiness to act promptly to restore the Australian people's confidence in our federal system of government and to rebuild integrity into public sector institutions and processes and its officials. In my first speech in this place, I said that, as I campaigned around the Hunter electorate, a common theme and discussion from blue-collar workers was that politicians are dodgy, politicians are on the take, politicians are on the gravy train and they're only in it for themselves. Despite repeated promises from those who are now opposite us, we now have a government that will actually bring in a national anti-corruption commission, an independent authority with some teeth so, once again, the people of Australia can look at us—politicians—with respect and pride, knowing that we are doing the absolute best we can for the Australian public.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I for one am proud that we have now delivered on our election promise to restore trust and integrity within our federal parliament and within our community, with the National Anti-Corruption Commission to begin work soon. The measures in this bill will go some way to providing greater integrity and transparency around the process of appointing elected officials to high office and especially to ensuring that we have a system of government where we are able to have checks and balances and where one person cannot gain powers without adequate and warranted accountability to the Australian people and to the Australian parliament.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Integrity, accountability and transparency are vital in this place. We know that we must restore trust in the integrity of politics, and this bill, in the timely manner in which it has come to this place, shows our commitment to achieving that. I wish there had been no need for this bill. Obviously everyone does but, clearly, we must do this because of the former actions of the former Prime Minister and member for Cook. I commend this bill to the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="299964" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms FERNANDO</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Holt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:46</span>):  I rise to speak in favour of the Ministers of State Amendment Bill 2022. The passage of this bill is essential to preserve our Westminster style of democracy and prevent actions like those of the former Prime Minister, the member for Cook from ever taking place again.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In May of last year, Australians across the country and in my electorate of Holt spoke loudly at the ballot box, and they backed in the only party with a proper plan to bring integrity back to our political system. This Labor government has kept to that plan by acting urgently as a matter of priority on moving to establish an independent anti-corruption commission. In layman's terms this bill ensures that the actions taken by the former Liberal Prime Minister can never happen again. Going forward, this bill will significantly increase the accountability and transparency of government by providing everyday Australians with the information to know who is responsible for what ministry, who is appointed to the federal Executive Council and who administers the departments of state.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">You may be wondering why this legislation is necessary now. After all we have enjoyed 122 years of successful Commonwealth governments without it. It is only because of the actions of the former Prime Minister, the member for Cook, and his five secret ministries that this legislation became necessary in order to protect our democracy for the next 122 years. This bill also forms part of this Labor government's formal response to the Bell inquiry which was led by former High Court Justice, the Hon. Virginia Bell AC, with the final report being handed to the government on 25 November 2022. We have wasted no time since then in formulating this legislation to address these important sections of the Bell report to safeguard Australian democracy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Even now, I sometimes struggle to wrap my head around the actions of the former Prime Minister. When the news broke in August of the member for Cook's secret power grab of five of his own government's ministries between March 2020 and May 2021, I was truly shocked. To remind the House, those were the departments of health, finance, industry, Treasury and home affairs. It is not often that a politician is lost for words, but I certainly was. Thankfully, the Solicitor-General, Stephen Donaghue KC, wasn't. In the wake of these revelations, he said the principles of responsible government were 'fundamentally undermined' by the actions of the former government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To assure the public that the government took this seriously, we ensured the inquiry was nonpartisan by appointing someone independent like Ms Bell from the very beginning. The review heard from both current and former public servants, advisers, former ministers and experts in the field of constitutional law and public administration. For members of the opposition to label the Bell inquiry as anything less than extensive and nonpartisan is dishonest. In fact, three former Liberal prime ministers expressed their shock at the secret ministries revelation; it doesn't get more bipartisan than that. Former Prime Minister John Howard said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I don't think he should have done that, I don't think there was any need to do it, and I wouldn't have.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The next Liberal Prime Minister, Tony Abbott, said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">I'm just not going to defend what was done … it is just highly unconventional, highly unorthodox and shouldn't have happened.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For me, I think former Liberal Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull put it best when he said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This is a sinister stuff. This is secret government. This is one of the most appalling things I have ever heard in our federal government. I mean, the idea that a Prime Minister would be sworn in to other ministries secretly is incredible.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The opposition's position on this bill has been meek and murky before finally saying it'll vote for it, as though it's being dragged to do the right thing by the public.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Even with the strong condemnation from former Liberal prime ministers Howard, Abbott and Turnbull, it was still not enough for the modern Liberal Party to do the right thing and vote for the government's censure motion of the member for Cook. Instead, the member for Bass was the only Liberal with any integrity and who voted with the government. I have a lot of respect for the member for Bass for that vote, but I must say: how she or any other Liberal with a shred of self-respect can be led by someone like the current Leader of the Opposition, who lacks basic respect for the Australian people, is beyond me. How the member for Dickson can justify to the Australian people that the former Prime Minister did nothing wrong is truly shameful. All members opposite know what he did was wrong, yet only one had the integrity to put their money where their mouth is.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have spoken many times about the diversity present in my electorate of Holt. The ethnic, religious and geographical diversity makes it rather unique, and you're bound to speak to people with different views and priorities. However, one of the many things that unite us is the ideal of Australian democracy and that its representatives must do all they can to protect its purity. There is not one person I have spoken to in my community who is happy that their Prime Minister at the time lied to them, day in and out, for over one year. It was bad enough he told us he didn't hold a hose, didn't control when vaccines arrived in Australia and didn't control COVID safety measures; he did not rock up when people needed him to—unless it was to force someone to shake his hand, of course. This betrayal of people's trust, on top of everything else, was truly the last straw.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My constituents are extremely pleased to now have a government that is honest and is led by an honest man. Prime Minister Albanese stands in stark contrast to the member for Cook. His previous experience as the Leader of the House, as a minister and as a former deputy prime minister has put him in good stead as our Prime Minister now. Throughout Prime Minister Albanese's tenure, he has always approached the job with an honesty that is sadly becoming rarer in politics. His honesty in wanting to do the right thing is self-evident in the legislation we are debating today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The introduction of this bill shows that this government is delivering on its promise to restore trust and integrity to federal politics, which is exactly what Australians across the country have trusted us to do. I strongly believe that the measures in this bill will go quite some way to providing superior integrity and transparency around the process of appointing elected officials to high office, and to ensuring that we have a system of government with strong checks and balances rather than relying on centuries-old conventions. The changes proposed in this bill are one of many steps to ensure our political conventions can't be twisted or manipulated to the political advantage of one person ever again.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I commend this bill to the House and encourage all members who have basic respect for the Australian people to support it too. </span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr GILLESPIE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyne</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:56</span>):  I rise to say some cautionary words about the Safeguard Mechanism (Crediting) Amendment Bill. I fear that this will lead to further de-industrialisation of the Australian industrial base and lead to a further reduction in the amount of productive agricultural land being taken up so that people can get Australian carbon credit units at the lowest possible cost. You will find that industrial giants will buy up agricultural land because it's the cheapest way to generate Australian carbon credit units, let alone the new safeguard mechanism credits. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition government commenced the safeguard mechanism as part of the Emissions Reduction Fund under the Direct Action Plan. Entities with 100,000 tonnes of scope 1 emissions would be liable to pay a fee if they breached their allowance. This includes companies like our airlines Virgin and Qantas; fertiliser plants; smelters for nickel and other metals, like aluminium; ammonia production; LNG plants; and coalmines. It is going to affect all the industries that deliver our energy and minerals. It will be a major risk and cost to them, such that many of them will become unviable and will shut. They'll keep the Australian name and the Australian business, but they'll just import goods that they would have otherwise made in Australia and then make their money from retailing it. The countries that these industrial processes will be shifted to won't have the environmental standards that we have. We have seen so much of our manufacturing move offshore to other countries in Asia—with China being the biggest—that don't have as strict environmental standards as Australia has. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The intent of the amending provisions of this bill is an emissions reduction program on steroids. Reducing your footprint by 4.9 per cent—basically five per cent—per year, every year, is a huge industrial process because the physical entity has no other way to make the product that they're producing. As recently as 2021, there were 212 facilities that produced 137 million tonnes of CO2, which is only 28 per cent of total emissions. This bill, which will amend a cluster of existing legislation—the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting Act 2007, the Australia National Registry of Emission Units et cetera—will affect all these large entities. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For instance, airlines only operate because of jet engines. I don't know how existing jet engines are going to improve their efficiency by five per cent every year, year on year. It means that we'll all have higher airline fees. The Tomago aluminium smelter, across the river which forms the border of my electorate, sells its aluminium based on the price that aluminium goes for at the London Metal Exchange. They can't just add their costs on top of the cost of production. If they don't meet the market price, they don't get the sale, and they are going to be under huge pressure.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need fertilisers being made in this country. We are an island on the bottom of the earth, and we need to have sovereign manufacturing capability in so many things. The modern industrial world has been made on ammonia, on chloride, on liquid natural gas, on steel and other minerals being smelted and on concrete being made. In Australia, we have entities that for decades have done this. We industrialised after World War II so that we wouldn't be caught as we were in World War II, when we were dependent on Britain for a lot of our manufactured goods. That's why we built our power stations, so that we could make things and make ourselves independent. It is why we search for oil and gas and why we built power stations in the Hunter, up in South-East Queensland, in the Latrobe Valley in Victoria and around the place, because we wanted to make stuff.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The good members on the other side are all for making manufacturing, but you're not going to have any manufacturing growing or even existing if your business is sent to the wall financially. The essential entity that runs through all manufacturing is the cost, availability and reliability of energy. Industrial processes don't run, like an office, from nine to five. They run 24 hours a day. All those things that I've mentioned are businesses that have to operate 24 hours a day, and their cost of electricity is going up because our electricity system is becoming more and more reliant on low energy density that's randomly available, producing direct current that needs to go into an alternating current system, and that integration of random variable renewable energy sources is incredibly expensive. The generation of the electricity at the solar panel or at the wind farm, at that very spot in time, is cheap, and it would want to be cheap, because it's only available 20 or 30 per cent of the time at best. This bill will mean that all those businesses will be under huge pressure, and the knock-on effect will affect agriculture, because our fertilisers will cost more. They will have to come in from overseas. A lot of our manufactured goods, the bulky things, will have to come in from overseas, and that is the natural result of putting up the cost for these huge businesses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In agriculture, a lot of farms that are highly productive whilst they're worked are family owned or small businesses which will find that they are offered incredible prices by industrial entities who are buying land to generate Australian carbon credit units or the new safeguard mechanism credits, which are defined in this bill. There are all sorts of ways that we can offset emissions. There's an obsession with growing native forestry, but it will not be efficient if you shut down a productive farm to let it go to native forestry and trees.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Admittedly there are plenty of good farming entities which on the face of it go through a difficult period—a drought or a flood—and it gets all too hard. They're privately owned, and I can't begrudge a farmer who has no next generation that wants to take up the business or no-one locally that's prepared to pay what these big industrial entities will pay for agricultural land. Good luck to them if they sell, but we're getting dairy farms that are being shut down, good beef production—even sugar cane has a lot of land that could be put into generating safeguard mechanism credits and Australian carbon credit units.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are also getting assaulted in agriculture with credits for biodiversity, which are limiting the viability of the farm in the long term if too much of their productive land is being put into biodiversity. Some of the people in my area who generated carbon credit units by soil organic carbon farming found out in the floods a lot of the organic carbon leached out of their soils, and now they owe money to the crediting mechanism. So it's a double-edged sword. Generating locked-up farms that were productive will not help anyone; it will mean we won't be making as much food and fibre, if that is indeed the case, and lots of people are saying the same thing: it's going to be inevitable, because to reach this 4.9 per cent reduction each year there will have to be lots of safeguard mechanism credits generated and plenty of existing Australian carbon credit units that will be used up.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The primary legislation will need legislative instruments or secondary legislation, which will be determined by the minister. So it's starting at 4.9 per cent, but the current government, who are obsessed with thinking they're going to change the planet by doing all these things, could easily ratchet it up in subsequent legislative instruments. The methane pledge is also facing agriculture, which in other countries has led to blanket ordinances instructing people to reduce the size of bovine herds by up to 30 per cent. Even one state in Australia are already auditing herd size so they can document it, which is a pre-runner of producing an edict saying you have to reduce the size of your herd.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Already in the last year one billion litres less milk has been produced in Australia. Prices being paid for milk are going up. This is a retreat away from an industry that used to have 15 or 16 billion litres of milk a year and is now down into single digits, and I'm afraid we will end up importing even simple milk and dairy products from across the Tasman or from other countries in Europe or North America, when all these people with productive farms, running huge herds of either beef or cattle for meat or for dairy, are faced with the unenviable decision to sell off to someone bidding a whole lot more than other agricultural concerns.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The idea of carbon credit units is a bit like buying indulgences, which were part of what caused the Reformation. People could commit any number of sins, and you went off to the bishop or the Pope and you bought what were called indulgences so you got off scot-free. This carbon trading mechanism is exactly the same logic. You can have a factory spewing out things that are bad for the atmosphere either here or anywhere in the country, and you'll be hit with a bill. In the bill the maximum fine might be actually $41 million a year. That will come straight out of profit, so that's why I say a lot of these big industrial players will be forced to look at taking back agricultural land, all to get their carbon credit units or safeguard mechanism credits—their indulgences, modern-day indulgences.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Seriously, we are dreaming if we think what we are achieving is far more than our portion of what we generate for the world. We're a country of 25½ million people but we produce food for 120 million people. We produce raw energy that feeds and runs the industry of Japan, Korea and other countries in Asia—Malaysia, Indonesia. Even Ukraine has kept its lights on with our raw energy. But these sorts of businesses that have lifted people out of poverty by allowing their countries to industrialise, like we have done for Japan—our first export of coal to Japan was in 1864, and we have been supplying about 70 per cent of their electricity-generating coal for decades. But this bill will have ramifications for our neighbours and allies who rely on our energy as well as our food if we've got one side of the legislature trying to grow agriculture and production and manufacturing, and the other side shutting it down.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We've all got to be on the same page and realise the consequences of this bill. It will have consequences. Good members on the other side may not think it, but, sure as eggs, so to speak, it will happen, and it will be counterproductive to the wellbeing of this nation. Sorry to disappoint you, but I don't think this is a good bill. Go back to the beginning and work out a better way.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macquarie</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:11</span>):  They are going to be hours of speeches from those opposite in <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span> saying why it won't work, why we shouldn't do anything, why it's not being done well enough. In fact, the biggest danger we face as a country is the do-nothing attitude that those opposite have had for nearly a decade. This is not a time to be saying why it won't work, why it can't work or why it shouldn't work. It's a time to be saying, 'Let's make it work.' Let's come together and have a piece of legislation that can have a starting point here, can continue as we evolve as a country and, as our energy needs change, can evolve with us. I'm very proud to say that the Albanese government is not prepared to do nothing, not prepared to just sit back and shrug its shoulders and find all the excuses in the world for inaction. We want to see things change.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think we need to go back to why this bill, the Safeguard Mechanism (Crediting) Amendment Bill 2022, is necessary. It's necessary because we've made a commitment to reduce national emissions to 43 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030 and to net zero by 2050. These things are realistic and achievable but it takes that deliberate effort and sustained effort to achieve them, and every sector has to play its part. This bill is about addressing one part of the jigsaw puzzle that goes into reducing our emissions, and, just as importantly, increasing our reliance on renewables.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The safeguard mechanism is providing for us a well-established framework—it's already legislated—that places emissions limits on large industrial facilities. We've been very clear that this policy is designed to get emissions down from every one of the big industries, new providers that might come in, the fossil fuels industry. It's not just about coal and gas; it's about things like aluminium. It's about the steelmakers. It's about fertilisers, and making sure they're playing a role in reducing emissions. It's about our airlines. It's not just about the old businesses; it's about the new ones too. It's about the facilities that have been there for a really long time, and it's about the ones that might come online. It isn't just a mechanism for one thing in particular.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's be really clear: if this bill doesn't pass, nothing changes. There'd be no constraints at all on emissions for anyone. I am staggered to think anyone in this parliament, having been through the election we had and seen the results delivered to this place, can be under any doubt that the vast majority of Australians want to see action on climate change. If this doesn't pass, nothing changes, and that would be a tragedy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As to the effect of this, I want to address some of the questions that have come to me. I thank all the people who've really looked into this and tried to get their head around it. They've got together and come and met with me to talk about the things that they'd like to see it go further on. I completely understand their desire to do that, and I have listened to all of those. I've had emails, phone calls and face-to-face meetings, both here and back in my electorate, with people of the Blue Mountains and Hawkesbury. I really welcome those inputs and the desire to say, 'We can see that this is happening; we would like it to go just that bit further.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I think it's important to remember that what we are talking about is a piece of legislation that, as it stands, is the equivalent of taking 205 million tonnes of carbon out of the air by 2030. That's the equivalent of two-thirds of the cars on Australian roads, so it's not a modest piece of legislation. It's a significant piece of legislation that changes an existing mechanism, and it has the support of business to do that. Business has been crying out for certainty, and not just for the last decade. The investment banks in the sector that I worked in prior to coming to parliament have been crying out for certainty since the early 2000s, saying, 'We just need a set of rules that will allow us to get going on this stuff and to really ramp up renewables.' Finally, as a government, we are bringing that certainty to this policy area.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's one other part of the bill that I think is worth taking people through, and that is around the emitters and what they're going to be asked to do. Emitters will be given a baseline, and they will be asked to gradually reduce their emissions. We're starting with 4.9 per cent—I like to round it to five per cent—on their current level because want them to be active and incentivised to make changes to how they do it. One of the questions that has come up is about the integrity of the scheme. Emitters are allowed to use offsets where they can't reduce their levels, and questions have been raised about the integrity of that scheme. Let's talk about integrity and how that scheme is going to stand up to scrutiny, which is exactly what it should do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We commissioned the independent review, the Chubb review, to ensure that the carbon-crediting framework has integrity so that we can maintain a strong and credible reputation, because we absolutely accept that that's required. The expert panel concluded that the scheme was sound, but they had a bunch of recommendations for ways that it could be made even more effective. There is going to be a very strong incentive for industrial emitters to reduce their emissions, but we recognise that many in those hard-to-abate areas are going to use credits.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have accepted in principle the 16 recommendations that the panel made and we are working through them. They are to ensure that the scheme aligns with the most modern expectations of best practice. That means things like maximum transparency of the scheme information. It means tweaking it so that it encourages innovation in method development and project implementation. It also recognises that we can support greater participation, including by First Nation communities. We've agreed to the 16 recommendations of the Chubb review, and we're working with stakeholders on the implementation. I thank the people who have written to me with their concerns about the integrity of that scheme. We shared that concern. We've acted on it, and now we're working through it.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I've already said the safeguard mechanism is going to save around 205 million tonnes of emissions between now and 2030, and I've mentioned that it's been consistently supported by business groups like the BCA, the AiG and the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry, those organisations who are representing very large and some smaller groups. The contrast is the idea that we needed to go even further. As I said, I completely understand the desire for it to go further, but these are the 215 biggest emitters in the country that we're targeting. Unless we get emissions down, unless they bring down their emissions or start to bring down their emissions by that 4.9 per cent each year that we're going to require them to do, then we're going to struggle to achieve the targets we have set, and we have set ambitious targets. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to talk about the renewable energy targets that we have. We're talking about 82 per cent of our energy coming from renewable sources by 2030. There are not that many months to achieve our 2030 target. I don't know what we're down to, maybe 78 months, maybe 79 months, but it's rapidly disappearing now that we are in March. We're looking at achieving that 82 per cent reduction in less than 82 months now. That's a big job, and we know it is a massive task. What it means is that by 2030 will still be having around 18 per cent of fossil fuels, and so we know there needs to be a supply of those fossil fuels. To those whose argument is, 'This is all just too hard, it's not going to work,' we know that achieving the renewables and maintaining the supply of those fossil fuels is a balance that we have to achieve. We don't have a choice in achieving it if we want our economy to remain strong, and that is one of our primary concerns. We see renewables as an opportunity for jobs, particularly in regions and other areas that are reliant on fossil fuels. We know this can be a trigger for a whole lot of economic growth and diversification. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was grateful that a couple of weeks ago that there were groups here in parliament talking to us about another concern they have on the safeguard reforms, and that is that the new industries that come on board might blow out the modelling. I want to be really clear about what has gone into that modelling. What we have said is that there is room in the estimates we have made to achieve the 205 million tonnes of abatement, but we have also factored in a buffer, an additional reserve of 17 million tonnes, which will absorb any of the modelled new changes. Obviously, it is also a scheme that will run for a long time and it needs to be reviewed. There will be reviews to measure how it goes. It is not a 'set and forget'. I appreciate that's been the pattern of the previous three governments, 'Set and forget, let's just do it, tick a box and say we have done it,' knowing that that is not way to do change well. You don't do it once and expect that it will work; you need to review it and keep monitoring it. That's what we will be doing, and that will be able to take into account any of the changes that occur. We will be monitoring and then adapting to those changes. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is legislation that this parliament must support if as a nation we want to change the trajectory we have been on. I really urge people to look back at history, look at 2009. I remember the turning point on faith for people when a commitment to act on climate change was stymied by the joining together of two opposing parties, the coalition and the Greens. That led to Australia not getting a piece of legislation that would have been in place for nearly 14 years by now, and it would have made given us a totally different opportunity. That opportunity is lost, but the opportunity we have right now is there for the taking. It is profoundly disappointing but not surprising that the opposition will not be supporting this.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I urge the crossbenchers to think about the long-term opportunity this provides and the immediate opportunity it has to completely transform the way we see ourselves as a country striving for net zero. We're coming off more than a decade of this having been a frustration. Please, I urge the crossbenchers not to do that to the Australian people again. I urge you to think about the message we can send to the kids who come here and look down on this chamber, knowing that their future depends on the decisions that we make. A lot of us on this side are here not for our own generations but because we care about what's going to be left for our children and our grandchildren. This is the opportunity we have. We have a choice to end the uncertainty. We've made that choice; it's now up to the crossbench to decide where they want to be in Australia's history and, more importantly, the role they want to play in Australia's future. I understand that for many people it won't be a giant enough step—that's okay. A step is what takes you to the next one. It'll be profoundly disappointing if the vision that we have here is not able to be carried through, not just in this House but in the other place. To those on the crossbench: please think about this when you cast your vote.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Brisbane</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:26</span>):  The mining, transportation and burning of fossil fuels is the single biggest contributor to the climate crisis. If we want to avoid environmental and economic disaster by staying within 1.5 degrees of global heating, we must make real cuts to emissions and transition to 100 per cent renewable energy. One point five degrees—that number is not just a talking point. According to the world's scientists, it is a very real planetary boundary. If we breach it, our climate system is at risk of tipping over into spiralling chain reactions and we will no longer be able to control the climate breakdown. No area of our lives would be untouched by this—from our food supply, sending prices sky high; our hospital services being overrun; infrastructure damage, from sewage systems to flooding cities; and the loss of our precious natural landscape and wildlife. Climate damage is not some far-off, distant threat. We're already experiencing the shift, with 100-year bushfires and floods every few years. For us in the Brisbane electorate, the 2022 floods have left our community rebuilding for the last year now, with some local businesses only just being able to open their doors again, while others have been forced to close forever.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government seems to just expect everyday people and volunteers to clean up the mess from natural disasters and to keep pushing, year in and year out, to survive. They rely on individuals, families and communities to bear the brunt of extreme and unpredictable weather. Meanwhile, they are funnelling billions in taxpayer dollars into the pockets of the fossil fuel industry and making the climate crisis worse. Community members are taking on personal responsibility to reduce their individual emissions, like using reusable bags and paper straws and making choices about the foods they consume. Meanwhile the government allows the biggest polluters in the country to pay little to no tax, destroy our natural environment and then send us the bill. This is the only evidence you need to see whose side the government is on.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Governments only ever tinker around the edges when it comes to kicking their addiction to fossil fuels. They politely ask fossil fuel companies to just reduce their emissions, but this has not worked and it will never work. Their business model and method of profit come at the expense of our climate. This industry cannot regulate itself, and it is the government's responsibility to phase out fossil fuels to ensure our economy and climate are sustainable. The bill before us allows fossil fuel giants to offset 100 per cent of their emissions. If you think 100 per cent seems very high, that's because it is. The Climate Council thinks so too, stating that:</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Small">This is highly problematic because unlimited use of offsets will simply encourage carbon accounting to cover up pollution-as-usual. The design of the Safeguard Mechanism should prioritise <span style="font-style:italic;">genuine</span> emissions reduction, because tackling harmful climate change means Australia's emissions must shrink rapidly this decade.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill does not do that. It allows for the facilities regulated by the proposed safeguard mechanism to have access to unlimited offsets. So what incentive is there for these facilities to actually reduce their emissions? Analysis by the Parliamentary Library found that the cost of buying offsets to comply with the new safeguard mechanism proposals, to the fossil fuel industry—</span>

I must say they were absolute pros, especially handling a very controversial topic amongst school students—that homework should be banned in all Australian schools. Whilst that certainly won't be happening any time soon, I was greatly impressed with the level of debate, the points raised and the willingness of students to get up, have a go and have their voices heard. Having a strong understanding of how our democracy works and the importance of respecting free speech and differences of opinion is an all-important skill for children to learn. I also want to acknowledge Ms Bateman. It is clear 6SB has a fantastic teacher who provides a wonderful learning environment for her students to thrive. There are definitely some future politicians in 6SB, and I can't wait to see the positive impacts they have on our community.</span>

They need to learn in schools that aren't 140 per cent over their capacity. They need connections to sewerage for residential developments that have been in the pipeline for years. They need fair and just compensation for properties that need to be acquired. They need roads and public transport able to cope with the population growth. NSW Labor has promised to address these issues and more, like toll relief, public transport fare caps and the lift at Macquarie Fields station that our community has been campaigning on for many years. Our community has waited long enough and been patient enough. We cannot be ignored for another four years. Please consider your vote on Saturday. </span>

Ten years ago, Clare and Scotty established the almighty Monkeys Softball, a club that plays within the Sutherland Shire Softball Association. I'm proud to be a member of this club and also the association. For 10 years Clare and Scott have been, respectively, the president and vice-president of our club. As well as being two of our strongest players, they've been managers, coaches, fundraisers, umpires, administrators, 'monkey beer' brewers and the ones that cajole the rest of us into meeting our umpiring duties. </span>

Sutherland Shire Softball Association hosted a fantastic grand final on Saturday 11 March, where we again had the local Monkeys Derby in mixed B-grade. Sadly, the Spider Monkeys beat our Stuffed Monkeys team. We then recently had Monkeys presentation night on Saturday night. Congratulations to all of our winners. We raised over $500 to donate to the Scott Rindfleish Foundation. Congratulations to Clare and Scott, and happy 10th birthday to the Monkeys Softball Club. </span>

I'd like to mention three great examples of the Canberra region's Irish connection. Firstly, Bentspoke, Australia's best craft brewery, and Teeling, one of Ireland's great whiskey distillers, have come up with a unique one-off collaboration: a dry stout infused with Irish whiskey—an example of much of the great work we may be able to achieve, hopefully, under a trade agreement between the European Union and Australia in the near future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, I would like to talk about Daramalan educated Mack Hansen. Mack Hansen, originally a Vikings and Brumbies player, over the Saint Patrick's Day weekend played in the Six-Nations-clinching championship as a winger for the Ireland team.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">And, thirdly, last weekend, for about the 20th year in a row now, a multifaith ecumenical service was held at the Australian Centre for Christianity and Culture, effectively bringing together faiths from across the Irish diaspora, speaking out against sectarianism and speaking about inclusivity right across not just Ireland, but the Canberra Irish community as well. Happy St Patrick's Day all.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Indi</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:36</span>):  We all know about the devastation that the floods caused across regional Australia in October last year to homes and businesses, but the effect on our community groups, our sporting clubs and so many more has also been significant.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many communities in my electorate of Indi faced the cancellation of important annual events with so much work and revenue washed away by floods. One such group was the Benalla Agricultural and Pastoral Society, which was forced to cancel the spring show at the last minute due to floodwaters inundating the showgrounds. After years affected by the pandemic, it was set to be a great show and the committee, exhibitors and community had done so much work.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But the townspeople of Benalla weren't going to let the flood stand in their way, and this weekend they will host the Benalla Autumn Mini-Show and Exhibition. The mini show will have gardening, photography, textiles, cookery, crafts and art competitions, and so much more. Just like community groups, sporting clubs and businesses in regional communities across Indi and right across Australia, the Benalla Agricultural and Pastoral Society is not giving up but is instead innovating and putting in the work to show up for the town, and they'll be doing it all again in spring.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Well done to everyone on the committee: president, Christine Ogden; vice-president, William Ferguson; secretary, Wendy Beer; treasurer, Beth Schultz; assistant secretary, Maureen Freshwater; and committee members Lorraine Edgley, Kerryn Amery, Genevieve Saunders, Julie Dickinson-Franks and Tamar Dalton.

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Robertson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:37</span>):  Libraries around the Central Coast are turning 75 years old this year, and I want to wish our outstanding libraries across the Central Coast a huge happy birthday. Libraries are important community centres and provide people with access to information, education, entertainment and so much more. Libraries also allow people to pay council rates or access a JP to certify legal documents.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The first library on the Central Coast was Woy Woy Library, which was established in the former Woy Woy shire chambers building in 1948. Now there are 10 library branches across the region, from Umina Beach Library in the south all the way to Lake Haven Library in the north. On average, these libraries accommodate half-a-million visitors each year and the library services also extend to mobile libraries that visit 20 locations across the region and a home-delivery service for people who are housebound. Combined, these services loan, on average, 1.2 million items each year from a collection of 243,590 physical items.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Warringah</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:39</span>):  I wish to raise visibility for an important local service in Warringah within the early childhood intervention and education space. The Darwood Spilstead Service has a long history in Warringah. With its own Spilstead model, it has proven that an integrated, centralised and evidence based model of care delivers far greater long-term results, as well as impressive cost efficacy. The Dalwood Spilstead Service offers a one-stop shop, which integrates an expansive list of key services. The services are holistic and compassionate, and the results are profound and long lasting. I was delighted to visit the service last week, and I thank the entire team for their incredible hard work and innovation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Family vulnerability and early childhood trauma affect 3.2 per cent of all Australian children. Sadly, First Nations children are disproportionately represented in this figure. When I toured the service, I learned of the funding commitment anxieties, where some vacancies of staff remain undetermined and unfilled due to the lack of confirmed ongoing funding. This successful Spilstead model is currently only implemented in Warringah, which is crazy, and it should be a more widely replicated approach in areas with high rates of family and child vulnerability. I'm encouraging and inviting the Minister for Social Services and the Minister for Early Childhood Education to come and see this facility. We can do this in other areas. It works.</span>

I had the incredible honour of being an MC for A Day for Wendy. Wendy is a friend of our family, and we are good family friends with part of her family. So I MC'd a charity golf day for the Mark Hughes Foundation for Wendy. I'd like to thank the sponsors that were involved on that day. Without the help from all you guys, we could not have done what we did on that day. It was an amazing day at The Vintage golf course.</span>

I'd like to thank Jono Wilson for running the auction. The auction alone raised $35,000. I would also like to thank Jen and Ryan Bosden, who organised the day, together with Jess, Scott and Sophie Ingram. Those five worked extremely hard to make this day come together, and I can tell you that it was an honour for me to MC the day. At the end of the day we raised a whopping total of $65,533.61 for the Mark Hughes Foundation. That is a record for the Mark Hughes Foundation, and I take my hat off to anyone out there who is suffering with cancer now or is a cancer survivor, and their families. Thank you for all that you do and thank you to everyone around this area.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fisher</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:42</span>):  I was very pleased earlier today to meet with the 2023 Australian of the Year, Taryn Brumfitt, who's in the gallery this afternoon. Taryn has made it her mission to empower Australians to contend with body image issues, which are so deeply intertwined with eating disorders. Seventy-seven per cent of young Australians aged 16 to 25 experience body image distress, making them 25 times more likely to develop a psychiatric illness. With the advent of social media, is it any wonder? According to the Dove Self-Esteem Project and the Butterfly Foundation, 70 per cent of girls take their beauty standards from social media, and over half spend one to three hours on social media every day. Fifty-two per cent wish they looked better. Forty-eight per cent wish they looked like someone else.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These numbers tell a troubling story. But our girls are more than numbers, and so are our young boys. Real young people, but girls in particular, are losing their identity in a digital world, which is rating them and dehumanising them. I say to young Australians: you are more than a number. You are valued. You are loved, and, like all of us, you are perfectly imperfect. Please remember that normal is nothing other than a cycle on a washing machine.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Pearce</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:43</span>):  I rise to speak about a true champion of local businesses in my electorate of Pearce: the Wanneroo Business Association. A not-for-profit organisation, the WBA has more than 440 members and was founded in 1999, effectively servicing local businesses for two decades. One of the Wanneroo Business Association's biggest and very successful events is its annual business expo, which is being held this month on 30 March at a local venue, the Marina Mindarie. The event is free and welcomes everybody. It's an opportunity to socialise and network and, more importantly, it provides a platform to showcase local businesses to help them grow and reach their customers. The association also hosts its annual business awards night, which it has done since 2003. It's free to enter and allows businesses to benchmark their progress, review their performance year on year and enjoy their successes. I recently met with the Wanneroo Business Association's newly elected president, Steven Windsor, a chartered accountant with almost 20 years of experience. He is passionate about supporting local businesses in the areas of strategy and problem-solving and enabling them to grow. Mr Windsor is also extremely community minded and volunteers his time in a palliative care environment. I encourage all businesses in the electorate of Pearce to participate in this excellent organisation.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Casey</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:45</span>):  Like many communities across Australia, my community of Casey is feeling the pressure of the increasing cost of living, whether it be higher grocery prices felt by families or increasing electricity and gas bills for both homes and businesses. I know that many are struggling. We are fortunate to have so many amazing charities and not-for-profits in Casey who do tremendous work to support locals and families in need. I was delighted to show opposition leader Peter Dutton and our fantastic Liberal candidate for Aston, Roshena Campbell, the work of Foothills Community Care at their weekly Wednesday night meal in Ferntree Gully last week. We joined Foothills founder and CEO, Stephen Barrington, and their many volunteers who serve our community across the Dandenong Ranges and Melbourne's outer east as well as the team from Orange Sky, who provide free laundry services. Each week, Foothills serves over a thousand residents with a hot cuppa, a hot meal and a food parcel at Ferntree Gully and Upwey, but also, importantly, it provides a place of belonging, a place to chat and a place for community. Unfortunately, as many Australians continue to do it tough due to the cost-of-living crisis, services like Foothills Community Care and Orange Sky will become more and more vital. I thank you and the many amazing community organisations across Casey for your work in providing support for those in need.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hawke</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:46</span>):  The Albanese government was elected on the promise of strengthening Medicare, and that is exactly what we're doing. But the effects of the Liberals' GP crisis are still being felt in our community in Hawke. When the former government froze the rebate for six years and ripped billions of dollars out of primary care, it's no surprise that they left our health system in such a disastrous state. But, just as every Labor government does, we're cleaning up the mess left behind by the Liberals opposite. I've been in contact with many locals whose stories are all too familiar, like Ed in Melton, whose regular doctor retired recently, and the practice was unable to transfer him to another doctor. Not only that but they're no longer offering bulk-billing, so, for those who can stay with the practice, every consultation now comes with a private fee. For Brad in Sunbury, his GP clinic is struggling with staffing and has transitioned to mixed billing, making it harder for people to access necessary care. With new suburbs popping up all around the area, Brad's concerns are timely, and I look forward to working with him and the other GP practices locally, as well as the community, to fix these problems. These aren't unique stories, but it shouldn't be this way. This is exactly why the Albanese government is strengthening Medicare through a $750 million investment in primary care, $220 million for our Strengthening Medicare GP grants, and our Strengthening Medicare Taskforce, which has worked tirelessly to look at the best ways to boost affordability and access to primary care. We're doing the work to fix the crisis left by those opposite and strengthen Medicare for generations to come.</span>

Last week I had the pleasure of meeting Alannah Taylor from Manangatang, who is this year's Swan Hill Rural City Council Australia Day Young Citizen of the Year. What an impressive young woman Alannah is. Serving her community has been instilled in her since birth, through her father and long-term volunteer, Stephen. But Alannah herself is a real go-getter. She has participated in the Relay for Life in Swan Hill, sells raffle tickets for the Royal Children's Hospital Good Friday Appeal and volunteers at Anzac Day and Remembrance Day events as well as the famous Manangatang races. All of this was while she completed her own schooling. Alannah really goes the extra mile for her community. Last year she was school captain of Manangatang P-12 College, a sign of how well she is regarded by her peers. It is the young people of Australia such as Alannah who give hope for our country's future. We have always been a country built on hard work and honest effort, and Alannah exemplifies that. I take this opportunity in the chamber to acknowledge Alannah and her work for the community. I know she will continue to be a shining example for the youth of today right across Australia.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dawson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:51</span>):  I rise today to shine a light on an organisation doing some great work in my electorate. Mackay Women's Service is an all-round women's health and safety centre focusing on providing women's counselling, family programs, shower and laundry rooms, computer access and emergency assistance. I met with its CEO, Susan, and its service delivery manager, Tersia, a few weeks back, and they showed me around the facilities and told me about the support services that they provide.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The statistics on violence against women in Australia are just not acceptable. On average, one woman a week is murdered by a current or former partner, one in three women has experienced physical violence since the age of 15, and one in five women has experienced sexual violence since the age of 15. These statistics are horrifying. These women could be our mothers, sisters and daughters. Violence against women takes a profound and long-term toll on women's health and wellbeing and on their families, communities and society. This is not a women's issue but a societal issue, and it is vital we all do everything we can to stop violence against women in this country. Thank you to the Mackay Women's Service from the bottom of my heart for all the amazing work they do for everybody in the electorate of Dawson. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macnamara</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:52</span>):  This past weekend, we saw confronting sights on the streets of Melbourne as antitrans activists were supported by a squad of Neo-Nazis giving Nazi salutes. Both of these groups were seeking to spread hatred and vilify minority groups through their dark ideologies. Human rights are indivisible. Every Australian deserves acceptance, respect and to be part of a community, and trans people deserve nothing less than that as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to thank Premier Andrews for his prompt action in moving towards banning the Nazi salute in Victoria, and I hope other key states consider this reform as well. I say to any member of this House or the Senate who may be thinking of attending one of these rallies: think of the company that you will be keeping. Think of the message that this sends following the actions of this weekend.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I want to acknowledge the Victorian Liberal leader, John Pesutto, for moving to expel a member of his own team who attended, supported and promoted the Melbourne rally. Australia must be better than the ugly scenes we saw in one of the proudest houses of democracy in our nation. Bigotry, hatred, discrimination and vilification have no place in our diverse multicultural society.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Menzies</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:54</span>):  The way we debate the referendum this year matters. For several years, a central tenet of the Voice has been that all matters relating to it should be non-justiciable. The risks are obvious. Judicial delay is separate to veto and has implications for time sensitive and tightly held economic and national security decisions. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Late last year some lawyers began to question whether the proposed model would achieve this. From reports, it appears that the Attorney-General and the Solicitor-General also have concerns. Despite this, Professor Langton told the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian</span> that she does not understand how anyone could insist on nonjusticiability, stating: 'Their argument reeks of subconscious racism.' This is an alarming reversal of the view that Professor Langton and Professor Calma expressed in their 2021 co-design report where they described that nonjusticiability was an essential feature of the overall design. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The <span style="font-style:italic;">AFR</span> then reported that prominent silk Bret Walker SC gave a speech in which he branded a particular argument as racist. In the absence of a constitutional convention, we must hear from all sections of society, particularly the legal sector. This is why those with a platform should resist the urge to engage in slurs. To do so debases our democracy. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Back in 2012 Taryn founded the Body Image Movement, which aims to help people embrace their bodies. We know that struggles with confidence, self-esteem and body image are alarmingly common in our society. A national survey from the Butterfly Foundation, an Australian eating disorders charity, found that more than 40 per cent of Australians are dissatisfied with their appearance and 73 per cent wished they could change the way they look. That's why Taryn and the Body Image Movement aim to help people embrace their bodies by working to educate a global community, providing tools to promote positive body image. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Taryn wants us all to celebrate the fabulous diversity of our bodies—all different shapes, sizes, ethnicities and abilities. Taryn's documentaries, <span style="font-style:italic;">Embrace</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">Embrace Kids</span><span style="font-style:italic;">,</span> have been seen around the world. Her books, <span style="font-style:italic;">E</span><span style="font-style:italic;">mbrace </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Y</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ourself</span> and <span style="font-style:italic;">E</span><span style="font-style:italic;">mbrace </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Y</span><span style="font-style:italic;">our </span><span style="font-style:italic;">B</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ody</span><span style="font-style:italic;">,</span> are great resources for people of all ages. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Taryn has been recognised by UN Women, amongst other organisations, for her work and, of course, the Australia Day Council. She also happens to live right around the corner from me in Boothby. Taryn is an inspirational woman whose courage and authenticity has inspired millions around the globe and I know she'll do Boothby proud as our Australian of the Year. I've got two seconds to say: congratulations on your wedding. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">O'Connor</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:57</span>):  I rise today to congratulate Western Australian grain growers on a record grain crop for the second year in a row: 26 million tonnes. This confirms beyond doubt that we are the most efficient dryland farmers in the world at converting millimetres of rain into kilograms of grain. So spirits were justifiably buoyant at last week's Wagin Woolorama, O'Connor's premium agricultural showcase. Kudos to the organising committee on hosting a terrific two-day event and, particularly, for their warm Woolorama welcome to opposition leader, Peter Dutton. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mr Dutton and the WA Liberal team met with farmers, stock agents, veterinarians, livestock transporters and exporters. All were concerned about Labor's plan to ban the live sheep export trade. This ban will have a devastating effect on the market for merino sheep. Local meat processing facilities are already at capacity, reflected in record low prices in the saleyards. Labor should stop peddling the myth that sheep should die happy deaths here in Australia, instead of in state-of-the-art abattoirs overseas, where the workforce is plentiful, and our ESCAS system ensures animal welfare to the point of slaughter. As Mr Dutton said, this ban is intended to please voters in inner-city Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra, describing the Albanese government's decisions as anti WA and anti farming. </span>

Having come in here and voted against energy price relief for every resident in every suburb, he has no credibility on this issue.</span>

Last week saw the announcement in San Diego by me, President Biden and Prime Minister Sunak of the single biggest investment in Australia's defence capability in our history: strengthening Australia's national security and stability in our region; building a future made in Australia with record investments in skills, jobs and infrastructure; and delivering a superior defence capability into the future. But we're not just investing in our capability; we're investing in our relationships. I'll have more to say about the relationship with the Pacific and India, which was also enhanced, later on in question time today.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact is that, for the first time in 65 years and only the second time in history, the United States has agreed to share its nuclear propulsion technology. This will be an Australian sovereign capability, built by Australians, commanded by the Royal Australian Navy and sustained by Australian workers in Australian shipyards. We will contribute to the peace, stability and prosperity of our region and, of course we'll continue to adhere to our obligations under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty and the treaty of Rarotonga. We've been talking, throughout this period, with the IAEA to make sure that those obligations are upheld.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This will unlock a set of transformative opportunities for Australia, for jobs and skills and research and innovation—opportunities that will shape, strengthen and grow Australia's economy for decades, creating around 20,000 direct jobs for Australians: engineers, scientists, technicians, submariners, administrators and tradespeople. This will require a whole-of-nation effect and that's why, working particularly with the WA and South Australian state governments, it will make an enormous difference, training and skilling Australians. The scale, complexity and economic significance of this investment is akin to what happened when Curtin and Chifley created the Australian automotive industry in the postwar period. This will have a massive spin-off for Australian manufacturing and for the Australian economy. I thank, in particular, the defence minister and his team for the extraordinary work that they have done in the lead-up to this announcement.</span>

In those 10 months what we've been doing is economic reform, social reform, environmental reform, and making sure that we fulfil our first responsibility as a government, to make Australians safer by looking after our national security. I can confirm that we have been dealing with domestic issues, such as ensuring that people have access to cheaper pharmaceuticals from 1 January and cheaper child care from 1 July and that 180,000 Australians are benefitting from fee-free TAFE that we have introduced while addressing the skill shortages.

Last Monday's AUKUS announcement represents one of the most significant decisions an Australian government has ever made. It is probably the single biggest leap in military capability in our history, and Australia will become just the seventh country in the world to operate nuclear powered submarines. Why Australia needs to operate long-range submarines can be seen from the most cursory glance at our geography. We have long trading routes which connect us to the world, and that trade has grown. In 1990, trade represented about 32 per cent of our GDP; by 2020 it was 45 per cent of our GDP. One practical example of what that means is in the 1990s we had eight oil refineries producing most of our petrol onshore; today with only two oil refineries we import most of our petrol from overseas. Indeed, we import most of it from just one country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So Australia has always needed a long-range submarine capability, and the Collins class has been and continues to be a highly effective capability. But even as we seek to evolve it and extend its life, the fact is that every few days it is required to surface in order to recharge its batteries, an act which in the 2030s will become increasingly detectable. That means the capability will be increasingly diminished. Right there is why we need in the future a nuclear powered submarine capability which can have submarines on task for months at a time. Obviously this capability has the capacity to operate during a conflict, but its true intent is to provide for the peace and the stability of our region, because the defence of Australia doesn't really mean that much without the collective security of our region and the maintenance of the rules based order upon which we increasingly depend.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over the last few months and particularly over the last few weeks we've been engaged in an intensive effort in explaining our strategic intent to our neighbours in the Pacific and in South-East Asia, and since our announcement on Monday their reaction demonstrates the genuine appreciation they have for the transparency we have shown but also an understanding of why Australia are making the decision we are, because at the end of the day Australia's future nuclear powered submarines represent our contribution to the peace and stability of our region and the world.</span>

In the recent bushfires around the Hill End area of New South Wales, homes and livelihoods have been devastated. When will a disaster declaration be announced, along with a full suite of badly needed support for residents and farmers, including fodder transport subsidies and the $75,000 special disaster grants? Bathurst RSL has kindly donated $19,000 for hay, but almost half is going into transport costs. Farmers need those special disaster grants on the double to help rebuild their lives and properties.</span>

I note he went back to his local community during the last sitting week to assist in fighting the fires and to give his community the support they needed at that time, and that was an absolutely correct priority. The biggest fire, the Alpha Road fire, burned more than 18,000 hectares. I can inform the member that a disaster recovery funding assistance declaration was made just this morning. What that does is activate category A and category B assistance under the DRFA. The support the member is referring to—primary producers grants and freight and transport subsidies—would be activated by a request from the Premier, which, because of the New South Wales election being close, he would need to make in conjunction with the Leader of the Opposition in New South Wales. We have not yet received that request, but as soon as we do, if we receive that request, we will prioritise it to ensure that people get the support they need as soon as possible.</span>

When further representation was made by the member over specific funding, we also gave additional support there.</span>

More than 500 personnel are currently undertaking firefighting efforts across New South Wales and there are 21 aircraft deployed across the state. Across New South Wales these fires are having a devastating impact. They come off the back of the significant flooding events that have occurred. Disaster recovery assistance is being made available, when the request is made. That provides for freight subsidies for primary producers and it provides for concessional loans of up to $130,000.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the Deputy Prime Minister and the Prime Minister have said today, AUKUS is a game changer when it comes to our national security but also a game changer when it comes to our national economy. What was announced last week completely aligns with our broader economic plan because it will broaden and deepen our industrial base and it will deliver new jobs, new industries, new capabilities and new opportunities right around Australia. This will be a whole-of-nation effort and it will create whole-of-nation opportunities, including around 20,000 direct high-skilled, high-paid jobs, including technicians, engineers, scientists and project managers. It will deliver new expertise in science, engineering and cyber, and there will be critical investments right around Australia, including and especially in the great states of South Australia and Western Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is all part of our broader agenda to revitalise Australian manufacturing, including through the National Reconstruction Fund and all the other ways we are investing in advanced manufacturing in particular, because we believe manufacturing needs to have a bright future in this country and not just a proud history. These are exactly the kinds of jobs we want for our people—high-wage, high-skilled opportunities right around Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians have already paid too hefty a price for a wasted decade of dysfunction and drift when it comes to not just defence procurement but also the economy and manufacturing and industry more broadly. So we need to get cracking on investing in the future of defence but also the future of our economy at the same time. Of the $9 billion we will invest in this program over the forwards, about $6 billion will be invested in Australian industry and the Australian workforce. This is a big investment, and we've been upfront with the Australian people about the substantial pressures on the budget. Defence is one of the five fastest-growing areas of spending in the budget, along with the NDIS, aged care, health care and the cost of servicing the Liberals' trillion dollars of debt as well. That's why it's important that we have offset over the forward estimates every cent of this new game-changing investment in our national security. This is a vital investment to keep Australia safe, to broaden our industrial base and to strengthen our economy at the same time. It shows that we will always do what's in the best interest of Australians, their economy and their national security. </span>

Of course the member will be aware that just last week the Australian Energy Market Operator released the document on supply of gas opportunities, which outlined the very task which has been inherited by this government and which we have been dealing with, including through the energy ministers council and the significant reforms that have been agreed unanimously between me and the state and territory ministers to give AEMO more powers to ensure that underutilised storage capacity is better managed and to ensure they have the access to all the information they require—powers they did not have until this government negotiated it through the energy ministers council, and powers that are being implemented. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The honourable member refers to, I think he said legislation. He may not recall that the gas cap that was legislated—with no support from those opposite—does not apply to new supply. A small fact which escaped the honourable member when he was drafting the question in his office, working on it for hours. Maybe he remembered that, but it didn't suit his argument. Perhaps it was an inconvenient truth for the honourable member that he chose to ignore. Of course he was against it. He was for higher power prices, for higher gas prices in December. He came in here and voted for those higher prices. This side of the House voted for lower prices.</span>

The truth is that AUKUS pillar 1, the submarine policy, delivers two things for the Australian nation. One is the greatest capability enhancement to the Royal Australian Navy that this country has ever seen. The second one is the development of a fourth shipyard across the United States, Australia and United Kingdom, capable of building nuclear powered submarines. That is a critical part of this entire approach. There must be a fourth shipyard capable of building nuclear powered submarines. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the greatest industrial undertaking this country has ever attempted. We will be developing some of the most advanced manufacturing in the world. As the Treasurer said, as a byproduct we will be creating 20,000 jobs—20,000 well-paid, secure jobs, including 8½ thousand jobs building and sustaining the submarines themselves. Within that, four to 5½ thousand jobs building the submarines at the Adelaide shipyard, twice the amount that would have been building the Attack Class previously. This jobs figure doesn't even include the supply chain jobs that will inevitably come as well. My message to the Australian people and Australian industry is: this work starts right now. $6 billion has been allocated over the next four years to invest in the industry and workforce for the infrastructure upgrades, for skills development apprenticeships, including a skills academy in Adelaide, training hundreds of apprentices each and every year, and capacity-building of suppliers so that our Aussie companies can get a good shot of the work, not just for Australia but for the United States and the United Kingdom. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Work on the submarine construction yard starts right now. Training starts right now, and hundreds of Australian workers will be going overseas to work in UK and US shipyards developing skills and experience that will make a great contribution for our project. There are also opportunities in the supply chain. It's not a well-known fact that Pacific Marine Batteries, from the member for Hindmarsh's electorate, already supply batteries to the Astute class, and Thales at Rydalmere in Sydney provide sonar components. So Australian companies are already providing components, and, when we have a fleet of over 17 submarines, there will be great opportunities. Thirty billion dollars will be allocated over the life of the project to invest in skills and industry uplift in Australia, because the truth is this is the greatest industrial undertaking this country has made. It will modernise Australian manufacturing. It will lift up industry and employ 20,000 Australians in cutting-edge jobs that will provide a future for them and help safeguard the nation.</span>

Can the Prime Minister confirm that this year more than half of mortgage holders in every state will move from a fixed rate to a variable rate, with Victoria hit the hardest, at 61 per cent? Doesn't this mean families will be hit with significantly higher repayments as a result of nine consecutive rate rises on this government's watch?</span>

I urge her to keep that up, because there are going to be countless opportunities for Western Australians, coming out of this great AUKUS announcement, when it comes to maintenance, operation, sustainment and infrastructure build.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Following on from that, I cannot emphasise enough just how fundamental our Defence Force personnel are to the AUKUS announcement that was made last week. We know that it is our Defence Force personnel that is our most important capability. They are the ones that operate our great capabilities; they're the ones that keep our equipment moving and that are able to work in our national interest to make sure that we have the edge. Ultimately, it's not just about having the equipment; it's about making sure that we have the people that have the smarts to deliver the operation of that equipment in our national interest.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As part of that, we need to grow out naval force, particularly our submariners, and that's why this week we launched our new naval recruitment campaign, Live a Story Worth Telling, making sure that Australians are aware of the great breadth of opportunity that is available by being a member of our Navy, whether it's supporting Australians at home, supporting our near neighbours in times of crisis or emergency, or working overseas in support of our national interest, whether it's above the sea or below it. Especially now, with this great AUKUS announcement, we need to grow our submariner force. We need to grow that force from around 900 to over 3½ thousand by the 2050s to make sure that we have the capability of people to go with this great new capability of nuclear powered submarines. It's not just about the number; it's about the skills that they will hold, and that's why we have submariners now doing training with the United States and the United Kingdom, and that's only going to grow.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I had the great opportunity this week of visiting the USS <span style="font-style:italic;">Ash</span><span style="font-style:italic;">eville</span> while it was in port in Western Australia, meeting its fantastic crew and learning from them about the training that they are undertaking and the training that our submariners will be undertaking as we grow our capability here at home, working with our friends in the United States and the United Kingdom, growing that capability within our Defence Force personnel, growing that sovereign capability here to operate our own submarines from the 2030s onward. That's why this is going to be such a game changer for our country, for our Defence Force and for our submariners, and I encourage everyone to look at the great opportunities that exist in our Navy today.</span>

Some half a million Victorian families and businesses will see their electricity bills rise from July. Yearly household bills will rise from $1,400 to over $1,800, and yearly small-business bills will jump from $5,600 to over $7,300 a year. Why did the Prime Minister break his promise that energy prices would fall by $275, and why do Australian families always pay more under Labor?</span>

Here's what Clare Savage, the Chair of the Australian Energy Regulator, had to say on 15 March: we have seen 'unprecedented volatility in wholesale electricity markets' over the last couple of years. We have had very high coal and gas prices as a result of the war in Ukraine and the recovery from the pandemic. We've also seen a number of outages, in particular at our old coal plants.

There's a bit of rivalry between our two great cities, but, as residents of regional Australia, we both understand the role that the regions play in supporting our defence forces and the jobs and investments that can come with new defence procurement projects. Regions all across Australia are rightly very proud of the work that they do to support our nation's defence and our defence forces: Bushmasters made in Bendigo, tactical gear made in Townsville, small arms made in Lithgow and munitions made in Mulwala and Maryborough. Regional Australia is doing its share in providing our soldiers, sailors and aircrew with the materials that they need to keep our nation safe and secure. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With AUKUS, defence industries across Australia will have the opportunity to take part in the next generation of growth. This project will deliver the single biggest capability acquisition in our history. It is one of the great industrial endeavours of our age. There will be an estimated $30 billion invested in Australia's industrial base over the next 30 years, supporting Australia's supply chains and building the skills and capabilities to deliver these projects. We know that there are opportunities for South Australia, the home of Australian nuclear-powered submarine construction, and for Western Australia, but investment will not just be confined to these states. Nor will it to our cities: we know that our regions are set to benefit as well. By necessity it will be a whole-of-nation effort, delivering significant uplift to businesses and industries right across the nation. Its flow-on benefits will be immense, with new skills, new capabilities, new technologies and new opportunities, and we are determined that our regions will benefit from this as well. There will be opportunities for Australian industry to be a part of a trilateral endeavour and support the supply chains across all three partners here in Australia, in the United Kingdom and in the United States.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is a significant and unique opportunity for jobs and skills right the way around Australia, creating 20,000 direct jobs over the next 30 years. We know that right now there are kids in schools across Australia who will have a long career—a long and productive career—in defence industries, including young people from our regions, thanks to the investment that we are making in our nation's security. We estimate that at least $6 billion will be invested in the Australian industry and workforce. It's a rare national opportunity. I know there are many, many businesses and industries across regional Australia that will be keeping an eye on this defence procurement. I am determined, as are all of the regional members in this place, I am sure, that our regions will have a share of what is a huge project and a huge opportunity for manufacturing and industries across regional Australia. </span>

Prime Minister, will you help to prevent such unconscionable disasters in future by bringing Australia into line with countries like the US, the UK, France, Germany and the Netherlands where declaring war is the prerogative of the parliament, not the Prime Minister? </span>

Of course, he had a career in the intelligence community. Decisions about war and the deployment of Australian forces are among the most serious that any government can make, and I have made clear my own view that parliamentarians should be given the chance to express their views following a cabinet decision to go to war. We have referred the issue to an inquiry now being conducted by the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. As the member for Clark said, there are different forms of determination in different parliaments around the world. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There were two days of parliamentary debate that Bob Hawke allowed after his cabinet decided to join the first Gulf War, but the member for Clark is right to say that, 20 years on from the Iraq War, we can all reflect on the many tragedies of that conflict and its ongoing effects. Our thoughts are with the people of Iraq, as well as the Iraqi community here in Australia, some of whom fled that conflict. Our thoughts are also with the men and women of the Australian Defence Force. They obey, appropriately, the instructions of the government of the day, and I note that Labor opposed that intervention. Simon Crean, I think courageously, went and farewelled the troops, to make it very clear that he opposed the government's decision, but he supported them, as we must always do in this parliament. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to conclude by saying that I acknowledge the brave contribution and sacrifices that were made by the ADF and civilian personnel who conducted or supported operations in Iraq. We do remember, as well, those Australian service personnel who died and their families, and we all share our deepest sympathies with their families who would still be feeling their loss.</span>

There are decisions that governments make that are not agreed with or are supported, depending on the circumstances in relation to committing troops to a conflict. Today, on the 20th anniversary, I want to pay respect to all those men and women who wore the uniform of our country and represented us in our country's name at the direction of the government of the day. They were involved in combat operations, in counterinsurgency, in the training of Iraqi security forces, in national reconstruction and in humanitarian work. Today I think it's particularly appropriate that we remember the fallen. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We remember Flight Lieutenant Paul Pardoel. Paul was a dual citizen who served with both the Royal Australian Air Force and the Royal Air Force. In 2005 the RAF plane he was travelling in was attacked and crashed, killing all 10 on board. We also remember Trooper Matthew Millhouse. In 2004 Matthew's armoured vehicle was hit by an IED. Coming to after being knocked unconscious, he helped his injured mates and, as a result of that terrible incident, Matthew would later be diagnosed with early onset dementia which cost him his life in 2015. We also remember David Nary. David was a member of the SAS who served in operations in East Timor and in Afghanistan in his country's name. During 2005 there was a live-fire training exercise in Kuwait while preparing for deployment to Iraq, and David was tragically killed after being accidentally hit by a vehicle. We also remember Private Jacob Kovco, part of a security detachment which was protecting Australian officials at our embassy in Baghdad. Heartbreakingly in 2006 he was killed after an accidental self-inflicted gunshot wound. We also remember Australia's first casualty in Iraq was Jacob. We remember Squadron Leader Garry Doecke. He was a chaplain of the Royal Australian Air Force, and he provided great support to those men and women around him. We remember all of those who today still suffer the scars, having returned from that conflict, and we recognise the fact that all of them fought in their country's name at their country's direction to keep us safe where we live here in Australia.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gorton</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Skills and Training</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">14:46</span>):  Firstly I thank the member for Wills for his question and his ongoing interest in national security. An historic announcement last week will result in this country having superior defence capability and ensure there is no defence gap. The acquisition, followed by the production, of conventionally armed nuclear powered submarines is a game changer for our national security and a step change for our manufacturing sector.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course this is first and foremost a national security decision, but the economic benefits that flow from this decision are there for all to see: thousands and thousands of jobs in South Australia, in Western Australia and in fact across the nation, both direct and indirect jobs, starting with the construction phase at Osborne shipyards in South Australia and HMAS <span style="font-style:italic;">Stirling</span> in Western Australia and going on to the production of submarines. As the Prime Minister said earlier, we're talking about occupations including tradespeople, highly skilled technicians, engineers, scientists, submariners, project managers and many more.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Without the planned pipeline of skills to this very large and very long defence contract this goal cannot be achieved and will not be achieved. The role therefore of tertiary sectors, both vocational education and training and universities, is absolutely critical. Furthermore, in response to the question asked by the member for Wills, key to this goal is a skills and training academy which will be a dedicated hub to educate and train our workforce and ensure continuous development of the skills of that workforce. It will be a whole-of-nation initiative, with the central campus located in South Australia. Indeed there are already some very fine examples we can learn from, including BAE Systems Submarines in Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria, England, and there are other very good models as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is no doubt that, given the scale of this endeavour, we will need to draw together industry, businesses and unions, universities and the VET sector and state and territory governments. For my part I will engage with state and territory ministers through the ministerial council when we're negotiating the national skills agreement this year, because what we do require is a strategic approach to the investment in skills in this country not just for AUKUS but for the transformation of the energy sector and other areas that we confront in our economy. This government does not underestimate the enormity of the challenge that we face, but we'll dedicate ourselves to getting this done in the national interest.</span>

Why did he do that? It's beyond my comprehension. It's also beyond my comprehension why he is determined to vote against the safeguard mechanism that was the former government's own mechanism put forward. How can they even vote against their own policy? They are so determined to vote no. But the energy regulator made her position clear that the default marker offer would have been much, much lower, to quote her, than it would otherwise have been, had that intervention not occurred.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We do have an inflationary issue globally. It's a global issue. It's due to supply chains, due to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and it's all of course in the aftermath of the global pandemic. But what the Secretary of Treasury had to say in evidence before Senate estimates was that the energy price relief package will make a material difference to reducing cost of living pressures. That's what they had to say. Philip Lowe, the RBA governor, in his address to the Financial Review business Summit on 8 March, similarly referred to what was happening with high inflation. He said: 'The high inflation that we're currently experiencing is one of the legacies of the pandemic and of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The pandemic interrupted the supply side of the global economy and this pushed up costs and prices, and on top of this, the monetary and fiscal policy response to the pandemic has also pushed up costs and prices.' There of course he was referring to the last budget of the former government in March, where considerable money was pumped into the economy. It all ended as soon as people voted in May. That considerable increase also had an impact as well—not according to me; according to the RBA governor. </span>

India is a key strategic partner, a partner of some 1.4 billion people. That represents a growing, dynamic nation that is brimming with opportunity. We have a very rich friendship, shared by our common democratic values. Our cultural links as well are critical. It was good to meet with Prime Minister Modi for the fourth time, and I look forward to welcoming him at the Quad leaders summit in a couple of months time. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This visit did advance our cultural, economic and security ties. We discussed the comprehensive economic cooperation agreement that we want to conclude by the end of this year. On cultural issues, I arrived on the day of Holi, a very important, colourful spectacle that takes place here in Australia, but particularly in India. I was able to pay tribute to Mahatma Gandhi at Raj Ghat and had that great honour given to me. We also took the trade minister, who showcased Australia's products there in India, including the wonderful food and wine that we have available here, and concluded an agreement between Australian film producers and Bollywood producers to bring more film production here. That means more jobs here. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the economy, we have a potential for massive growth. Over 25 CEOs and business leaders joined this trip. The CEO roundtable was an extraordinarily successful one, and an MOU was signed between the Business Council of Australia and the Confederation of Indian Industry. We also had 34 leaders from the renewable energy sector, again showing the cooperation that's there on renewable energy partnership. The Minister for Resources was there talking about extending the Australia-India critical minerals partnership as well. On education, we announced that Deakin University will be the first overseas university to establish a campus in India, in Gujarat. Wollongong university will be the second. This will make an enormous difference to us. On security, Australia will host Exercise Malabar for the first time this year, and I had the honour of touring INS <span style="font-style:italic;">Vikra</span><span style="font-style:italic;">nt</span>, the first aircraft carrier built in India. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have a great more to do to build this relationship. India will grow to be the third-largest economy in the world in coming decades. This means opportunity for us if we get the relationship right. I thank Prime Minister Modi for his extraordinary hospitality during my visit.</span>

I think it is tremendously important, when it comes to the submarines and the AUKUS deal more broadly, that every cent of it over the forward estimates has been offset. That is a tribute to the work of the defence minister, the cabinet and others working with the bureaucracy to make sure that we can make this game-changing investment in our national security and our national economy without adding any extra dollars to the deficits in the coming four years. I think that is really important. Obviously, when it comes to the broader priorities of the government, we are making big investments in health care. We are making big investments in skills. We have continued, including today, to make sure that when inflation is as high as it is right now there is the indexation of payments and all of the rest of that as well.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to the AUKUS deal, I'm not pretending that this isn't a big investment; it is. But it's an important investment as well, and it's a fraction of what we spend in some of the other areas that we care deeply about, where we've made big investments over the life of the 10 months of this government and will into the future as well. You will see in the May budget that not only have we offset the costs of the AUKUS deal but there will be new investments in some of the sorts of areas that the honourable member identified.</span>

Last week, when the Prime Minister visited India, he went aboard INS <span style="font-style:italic;">Vi</span><span style="font-style:italic;">krant</span>, an Indian aircraft carrier. I was very envious. It is a formidable capability. It is an important symbol of the growing part that security plays in the Australian-Indian bilateral relationship.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia and India have never been more strategically aligned. When I visited India last year, I had the opportunity to fly aboard an Indian Navy P-8 aircraft from Goa to New Delhi. I did that to highlight two other flights which occurred last year in April and June, where an Indian P-8 flew from Goa to Darwin and then an Australian P-8 flew the same journey in reverse. Both of these exercises built interoperability between our two defence forces. In these exercises, India and Australia were using each other's facilities. Most importantly, in this cooperation, allowing P-8s to fly from India to Australia greatly leveraged—almost doubled—the effective capability of this reconnaissance and surveillance platform, relative to having a P-8 do a round trip from a single airport. It is a practical example of how we are looking for every opportunity to have our defence forces work more closely together, and this year we take the next step.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Exercise Malabar began in 1992 as a bilateral naval exercise between India and the United States. Today it's an exercise which involves India, the US, Australia and Japan. In its most recent iteration, Australia has been participating since 2020. Last year, we contributed an oiler, a frigate, a submarine and a P-8 to this exercise, and this year we expect to make an even larger contribution. As the Prime Minister said earlier, this year Exercise Malabar will be happening off the coast of Sydney, because for the first time Australia will be hosting Exercise Malabar. This represents an enormous leap forward in the defence relationship between Australia and India, because both of our countries understand that, by having our two defence forces work more closely together, we can provide far better for the security of the Indian Ocean and of our region.</span>

Well, I'll tell you what: not only am I welcome to talk to my energy minister but I have had a chat with the energy minister in New South Wales as well, and we came to a common position about what was required to go forward, not just with the energy minister but with the energy shadow minister as well. Perhaps, if the Leader of the Opposition got through border control and into New South Wales, he could ask them a question. I'd say to the member for Mitchell, who has such good relationships with the Liberal Party in New South Wales: if you want something passed on, just ask me, and I will get you the answer.</span>

The member for Pearce represents so many Indian Australians in the North Metropolitan area of Western Australia, and I congratulate her on the excellent work she does with that community. India is one of Australia's most significant partners in the Indo-Pacific region. Geographically we share the Indian Ocean, and geologically we share a tectonic plate. But, most importantly, we share a belief in democracy and democratic values, and our relationship is characterised by strong people-to-people links.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government's respect for those shared values and interests between our nations was demonstrated in the recent visit to India by the Prime Minister, on which the trade minister and I accompanied him. The Prime Minister led a very significant delegation of Australian business leaders to meet with their Indian counterparts, and the trade minister and I met with relevant Indian ministers, because, as well as our shared values, India represents an unmissable economic opportunity for Australia. India is set to become the world's most populous country this year, and in coming years it will become the world's third-largest economy. While India is already Australia's sixth-largest trading partner, we see enormous potential and economic opportunity for our two nations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese-Labor government recognises the importance of critical minerals to net zero, and so too does the Indian government. In particular, India's ambitious goals of 50 per cent renewables and 30 per cent electric vehicles by 2030 provide an excellent opportunity for us to work together on the extraction and processing of critical minerals. This is an opportunity the government supports through the Australia-India Critical Minerals Investment Partnership, which I signed with India in 2022. It was indeed an absolute honour to meet Prime Minister Modi, the leader of the world's largest democracy, but I also enjoyed productive meetings with ministers in the Indian government to discuss critical minerals and the transition to net zero. It included meeting with the Minister for Power and New and Renewable Energy, Mr Singh, and my counterpart, the honourable Minister for Coal, Mines and Parliamentary Affairs, Shri Pralhad Joshi. While I was in India, Minister Joshi and I announced that we had completed the first phase of the work under the Critical Minerals Investment Partnership between our two nations. Together we have identified five projects—two involving lithium and three involving cobalt—on which the parties involved will proceed to sign non-disclosure agreements and begin undertaking detailed due diligence.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Working together, Australia and India can and will reduce emissions, guarantee energy security and diversify global markets for critical minerals. Both Indian and Australian industry and workers are ready to reap the rewards. There is a massive economic opportunity for our resources sector. Like the Prime Minister, I join in thanking our Indian hosts for their enormous and wonderful hospitality on our recent visit.</span>

I particularly thank him as a South Australian member, because our intervention last December had an impact right across the national energy market, but it had its biggest impact in the honourable member's home state. The honourable member voted against energy price relief, and I would like him to explain to his constituents that our intervention has seen forward prices in South Australia come down 48 per cent—which is the biggest of any state in the Commonwealth. And, in fact, analysis from my department indicates that energy prices in South Australia, in SAPN, would have been $530 higher if it wasn't for the government's intervention.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">So that's what the honourable member opposite voted for. A difference of $530 is what the honourable member opposite voted for. As the Prime Minister indicated earlier, this is the default market offer, and the reason honourable members can debate this is that it's public. An essential starting point for this debate at question time is that it's public for all to see, and under this government it always will be public. Under those opposite we're not quite so sure because they have a track record. The member for Hume signed a regulation to keep the last EMO secret until after the election, the most cynical and pathetic act this House has seen in a long time. But it gets worse. I say this about the honourable member for Hume—</span>

After he kept the last EMO secret, he was asked on 29 April last year, on the Deb Knight radio show, about rising power prices, which he knew about at that point but had not disclosed to the Australian people. He said, 'There's fake news in what's being said about this.' He called energy price rises 'fake news'. He kept them secret and then he misled the Australian people and denied that they were happening. That's what the former minister did. </span>

The short answer is the benefits are huge, and they're not just financial. International education doesn't just make us money; it makes us friends. When you come to Australia to study you fall in love with our country, and you take that affection back with you when you go home—and in the world that we live in that's important. It's a living bridge between our country and so many other countries all around the world.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Before the pandemic, this was an industry that was worth $40 billion; however, it was basically cut in half by the pandemic. There is still a long way to go to get it back to where it was. On current forecasts, the total number of international students won't be back to pre-pandemic levels until the end of 2025. One country where students are coming back fast is India.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The number of students coming here from India has jumped by 160 per cent in just the last 12 months, and there is a big opportunity here to do more—more in Australia, but also more in India. Think about this: India is about to become the most populous country in the world. In India, there are half a billion people under the age of 23. There are 260 million kids at school. There are 10 million school teachers. And India have set themselves the ambitious target that by 2035 half of all young people in their 20s will be at their equivalent of TAFE or university.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">If they pull this off, it will mean that by the middle of next decade one in four people around the world that get a university degree will get it in India, and they're asking for our help. That's why the agreement I signed in Delhi a couple of weeks ago to mutually recognise each other's uni degrees is so important. It's why the announcement the Prime Minister made a little over a week ago that Deakin University would be the first overseas university to set up a campus in India is so important. It's why what the University of Wollongong is doing next is important. But they're not the only universities doing this. Eleven universities and peak groups also signed agreements with Indian universities while we were there.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's Anzac Day in a couple of weeks. In Greenway Park in Cherrybrook, in the member for Berowra's electorate, you'll find a memorial with the names of 12 Indian Australians on it, men who were born in India and who fought for Australia in World War I. Two of them are buried in Belgium. In the last 100 years our countries have changed an awful lot. Just imagine what these 12 men would think if they were with us today. I think they'd be proud of the country that we have become, the great multicultural country that Australia has become. I think they'd be excited to see India become a real economic powerhouse in the making. And I think they'd be over the moon to see our two countries working so closely together to make the most of it.</span>

The average Victorian household is spending $185 a week on groceries, up from $148 last year. Does the Prime Minister stand by his claim before the election that Labor would deliver real, permanent, meaningful help with the cost of living? Why do Australian families always pay more under Labor?</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Scullin</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Minister for Immigration, Citizenship and Multicultural Affairs</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:16</span>):  I thank the Member for Bennelong for the question. I know this is an area that he has a very keen interest in. His electorate is one that is very focused on the higher education sector. He knows, and we on this side of the House all know, that our Australian universities deliver world-class education to domestic students and also to international students. We also know, as the Minister for Education just advised the House, how absolutely vital international education is. That was demonstrated in the focus on international education in the very successful visits to India embarked upon by the Prime Minister and the Minister for Education in recent weeks. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also know that the international education sector bore a particularly heavy burden through the pandemic. The lack of a plan for when borders reopened created massive uncertainty for our universities, TAFEs and other education providers. Due to the lack of a plan, teaching and training that next generation, building our capacities across so many sectors of our economy, were subject to enormous uncertainty because the migration system was in crisis, with almost a million visas in the backlog. That was symptomatic of a migration system in disarray after nearly a decade of neglect. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have been getting on with the job of fixing that. The visa backlog is down. It is continuing to fall. I'm very pleased to announce that in 2023 to date we have had a record-breaking year for the student visa program. We are getting this back on track, meeting the challenge the Minister for Education was just telling the House about. I'm pleased to say that levels of interest in studying in Australia are even higher than pre pandemic. We are restoring confidence in our visa system, ensuring that students who are looking not just to Australia but around the world can have confidence that if they apply to come here they can get an answer quickly. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So far this program year more than 380,000 visas have been granted to students—40 per cent higher than in 2019-20, before the borders closed. This is because we're investing in our visa system, because we understand that we need people to want to come here. We need to welcome people here. We don't need to tell students to go home, as the former government shamefully did. We need to recognise that there is still work to be done to repair the damage that was done. We know, though, that we are making a real difference. Student visas lodged outside Australia are now being turned around on average in 13 days, and 80 per cent of applications in the department are now less than two months old. There is more to be done, but we are getting on with the work of restoring this vital sector in our national interest. </span>

                    </a>  by leave—I am glad to make a short statement on the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties's report into the convention between Australia and Iceland for the elimination of double taxation with respect to taxes on income and the prevention of tax evasion and avoidance and its protocol, and the convention on the protection of underwater cultural heritage—two separate agreements.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">First, the tax convention treaty is a double-taxation agreement that would establish a framework for governing cross-border transactions between Australia and Iceland. This will be the 46th double-taxation agreement to which Australia is party. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Based as it is on the OECD's Model Tax Convention on Income and on Capital, the tax convention draws on best-practice principles to avoid double taxation—that is, the potential for entities or activities to be taxed in each jurisdiction, rather than in the most appropriate jurisdiction—whilst also preventing base erosion and profit shifting and treaty shopping, all of which are bad things. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The tax convention identifies the persons and taxes to which the convention would apply and establishes where various types of income would be taxed, and it specifies how relief from double taxation will be provided. It contains special provisions dealing with the principle of nondiscrimination, provides for arbitration in certain circumstances, facilitates the exchange of information, requires parties to assist each other in the collection of taxes under certain circumstances, and establishes the grounds on which the benefits of the tax convention might be refused.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">During the course of the committee's inquiry, evidence was presented in relation to the constitutionality of the legislation, specifically with regard to the powers to be used in meeting the obligation under the convention to collect tax due to another country. The committee noted, however, the Treasury's substantially different views on this matter and, ultimately, such constitutional questions can only be resolved by the High Court, should that be required. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Though Australia's two-way trade with Iceland is of modest scope, the committee is of the view the tax convention will provide a foundation for such activities to expand. The committee notes, in particular, the provisions that would exempt Australian superannuation funds from the application of withholding taxes on investments they make in Iceland. On that basis, the committee supports the tax convention and recommended binding treaty action be taken.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second convention is the underwater cultural heritage convention. It's the first comprehensive treaty on this important matter that clearly transcends national borders, including with respect to our significant military heritage. Australia was actively engaged in the drafting of this convention for more than 20 years, and it's no surprise that there's broad support from those with relevant expertise and experience in the field in relation to this convention.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee heard from a range of stakeholders during the inquiry, including from government, non-government organisations, academics and other specialists. All supported ratification, many with considerable enthusiasm. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The ratification of the convention is a positive development in the protection of traces of underwater human existence, including those that have national and international significance, such as Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander underwater cultural heritage. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Ratification will also serve to ensure that Australia is able to continue its leadership on underwater cultural heritage issues in the Asia-Pacific and more widely.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Key elements of the convention include the protection and preservation of underwater cultural heritage that has been underwater continuously or periodically for at least 100 years, preferably in its original place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The convention obviously encourages states parties to sign up to bilateral, regional, or multilateral agreements on underwater cultural heritage and adopt rules and regulations to ensure its protection.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The convention provides for other protections of underwater cultural heritage, including raising public awareness, education, research, training in underwater archaeology and the exchange of technology.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some of the key issues that the inquiry considered were the value of the convention for the protection and preservation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander underwater cultural heritage, and the importance of the convention in terms of supporting its ratification and related work by nations in the Pacific. It's not a convention that's been ratified by many of our Pacific island neighbours. There's no doubt that, with respect to First Nations heritage, Australia does have an opportunity, as in lots of other areas of life, to do more. It's an area that's been identified for some time as being rich in underrecognised and underprotected cultural value.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As always, I thank the secretariat for all their work, all those who made submissions and appeared before the committee, the deputy chair and my fellow committee members. We support both of these conventions, but latterly the underwater cultural heritage convention.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On that basis, I commend this report to the House.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="281826" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr THOMPSON</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Herbert</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:26</span>):  by leave—Thank you for the opportunity to make a short statement on this report. It deals with two important issues which were set in motion by the former coalition government. The first is the Australia-Iceland double taxation agreement, which will help avoid double taxation while preventing base erosion, profit shifting and treaty shopping. This is a positive step as part of the then Treasurer's announcement in September 2021 that the government would expand the tax treaty network to cover around 80 per cent of foreign investment in Australia and about $6.3 trillion of Australia's two-way trade and investment. This will enable Australian businesses to take advantage of the opportunities that will emerge in the coming years. We know that tax treaties improve tax system integrity through the establishment of a bilateral framework of cooperation on the prevention of tax evasion, the collection of tax debts and rules to address tax avoidance. This provides businesses with greater tax certainty, which will encourage increased economic integration through foreign investment and trade.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The treaty with Iceland is one of those important steps, despite trade in goods and services between the two countries being fairly modest. But, as the national interest analysis stated, the tax convention would promote closer economic cooperation between Australia and Iceland by reducing tax barriers to investment and decreasing the cost of Australian businesses accessing Icelandic capital and technology. The committee welcomes the exemption allowing the treaty partner to exempt income earned by eligible Australian superannuation funds from taxation, only the third such agreement. Overall, we support the ratification of this treaty.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The second matter dealt with in this report is the Convention on the Protection of the Underwater Cultural Heritage, or UCH. UCH in Australia is derived from Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, as well as our military and colonial history, including shipwrecks, sunken aircraft and so on. These sites are important to our national identity, our history and the education of future generations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia has already been a world leader in this area, with the Underwater Cultural Heritage Act 2018, implemented by the previous government. Submitters noted that Australia is one of few countries in the world that actively manage artefacts in public possession that were removed from shipwreck sites prior to that protection.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important to note that the convention will respect human remains in maritime waters, particularly in cases like World War II shipwrecks in the South China Sea, where ships contain the remains of around 4,500 Australian, British, American, Dutch and Japanese servicemen. These sites will eventually fall under the protections of the convention.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Ratification of this treaty will allow us to be a regional leader, with the Asia-Pacific being the least represented region out of the 72 states parties to the convention. It has also been noted that it would potentially provide greater protection for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander UCH, as the state legislation will need to be harmonised through the implementation process. This is a positive move, and we are happy to support the binding treaty action being taken.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Thank you to those who made submissions and gave evidence, and to committee members, including the chair and the secretariat, for their work on this report, which I commend to the House.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr BURNS:</span>
                    </a>  by leave—I am pleased to present the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Human Rights Committee third scrutiny report of 2023, which was tabled out of session last week. In this report, the committee has concluded its consideration of the Quality of Care Amendment (Restrictive Practices) Principles 2022.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This legislative instrument amends the quality-of-care principles to specify a hierarchy of persons who can give consent to the use of restrictive practices on behalf of persons in aged care if the care recipient is deemed to lack capacity to give consent. Setting out who can consent to the use of restrictive practices on behalf of a care recipient engages a number of human rights limiting the particular rights of persons with disabilities. The committee thanks the Minister for Health and Aged Care and especially the Minister for Aged Care for their response to the committee's inquiries and acknowledges her advice that the instrument seeks to resolve issues raised by some of the states and territories about who can consent to the use of restrictive practices. The minister notes that this is intended as an interim arrangement until state and territory guardianship and consent laws can be amended or until around 2024.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee's mandate is to assess the compatibility of this legislation with Australia's international human rights obligation, and, as much of the details are left to the states and territories, it is difficult for the committee to fully assess this. The committee is concerned that the consent arrangements in this instrument are highly complex, and much depends on aged-care providers understanding the complex hierarchy and understanding the interplay between this legislation and the relevant state and territory laws. The committee considers this instrument risks being incompatible with a range of human rights, particularly the rights of persons with disability, noting that there is no requirement to provide for supported, rather than substitute, decision-making. Much depends on unknown safeguards in the state and territory legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee has recommended some amendments to this legislative instrument; however, the committee considers its concerns are broader than what is set out in this instrument. The committee would like to express its appreciation to Dr John Chesterman, the Queensland Public Advocate, who wrote to the committee and met with us privately to express his concerns with the current authorisation model for the use of aged-care restrictive practices.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Given the vulnerability of people in aged care and the significant humans rights concerns that the use of restrictive practices raise, the committee considers further consideration should be given to whether or not the consent model on the use of restrictive practices is the best approach to protect the rights of aged-care residents. The committee has recommended that an extensive consultation be undertaken to consider these broader issues. It also considers the issue of substituted consent to the use of restrictive practices in aged care would benefit from a broad-ranging inquiry. As the human rights concerns go beyond what is contained in this legislative instrument, such an inquiry doesn't neatly fit in with this committee's remit, so the parliament may wish to consider referring these important issues to a relevant policy committee. With these comments, I commend the committee's scrutiny report 3 of 2023 to the House.</span>

                    </a>  by leave—The committee supports the measures of the bill, which will enhance the oversight of Australia's intelligence agencies by the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security. During its inquiry the committee has acknowledged the important role of the inspector-general in providing assurance to Australians that intelligence agencies are performing their functions appropriately. At the same time the committee also considered that, while there are other legislative provisions that provide for the inspector-general to share information with the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Intelligence and Security, there are also some legislative barriers to information-sharing that could be improved. Therefore, the committee has recommended that the government consider appropriate legislative amendments to facilitate better information sharing.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Additionally, the committee carefully considered evidence regarding the eligibility for appointment to the role of Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security. The committee recommends that an individual's eligibility for the appointment to the role of inspector-general should occur after an appropriate period of time, to be determined by government, following that individual's employment in an intelligence agency. The remaining recommendations comprise a minor amendment to align the provisions of the bill with equivalent legislative provisions and to recommend that the Office of National Intelligence develop an employment framework governing staff engaged under its own enabling legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The committee acknowledges the amendments put forward in the bill form only part of the implementation of several recommendations from a series of independent reviews. The committee notes the implementation of remaining recommendations is currently under consideration. The committee looks forward to the opportunity to consider further advice and action in this regard in due course.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On behalf of the committee, I extend my thanks to the deputy chair and the other members of the committee who participated in the inquiry—within a very short time frame, I might add for the record. There was a fair bit of compromise amongst all of us to try and get this done, so I thank the deputy chair and all members of the committee—and the secretariat, of course—for making this possible in such a short time frame; it's quite unique. We had submissions provided and appearances at public hearings in record time, I think. I thank the secretariat for all their hard work on this inquiry and the report. I commend this report to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Brisbane</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:37</span>):  The mining, transportation and burning of fossil fuels is the single-biggest contributor to the climate crisis. If we want to avoid environmental and economic disaster by staying within 1.5 degrees of global heating, we must make real cuts to emissions and transition to 100 per cent renewable energy. The number of 1.5 degrees is not just a talking point; according to the world's scientists, it's a very real planetary boundary. If we breach it, our climate system is at risk of tipping over and spiralling into chain reactions, and we will no longer be able to control the climate breakdown. No area of our lives would be untouched by this—from our food supply sending prices sky-high to our hospital services being overrun, infrastructure damage from sewage systems, flooding cities and the loss of our precious natural landscapes and wildlife.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Climate damage is not some far-off distant threat; we are already experiencing the shift, with 100-year bushfires and floods every few years. For us in the Brisbane electorate, the 2022 floods have left our community rebuilding for the last year, with some local businesses only now being able to reopen the doors again, while others have been forced to close permanently.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government seem to just expect everyday people and volunteers to clean up the mess from natural disasters and to keep pushing year in and year out to survive. They rely on individuals, families and communities to bear the brunt of extreme and unpredictable weather. Meanwhile, they are funnelling billions in taxpayer dollars into the pockets of the fossil fuel industry and making the climate crisis actively worse. Community members are taking on personal responsibility to reduce their individual emissions, like using reusable bags and paper straws and making choices about the food they consume. Meanwhile, the government allows the biggest polluters in the country to pay little to no tax and destroy our natural environment, and then sends us the bill. This is the only evidence you need to see whose side the government is truly on.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Governments only ever tinker around the edges when it comes to kicking their addiction to fossil fuels. They politely ask fossil fuel companies to reduce their emissions, but this has not worked in the past, and it will never work. Their business model and method of profit comes at the expense of our climate. This industry cannot regulate itself. It's the government's responsibility to phase out fossil fuels to ensure that our economy and climate are sustainable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill allows fossil fuel giants to offset 100 per cent of emissions. If you just heard 100 per cent and think that seems very high, that's because it is. The Climate Council thinks so too. They stated that this is highly problematic because unlimited use of offsets will simply encourage carbon accounting to cover up pollution as usual. The design of the safeguard mechanism should prioritise genuine emissions reduction, because tackling harmful climate change means Australia's emissions must shrink rapidly this decade. This bill does not do that. It allows for the facilities regulated by the proposed safeguard mechanism to have access to unlimited offsets. So what incentive is there for the facilities to actually reduce their emissions? Analysis by the Parliamentary Library found that the cost of buying offsets to comply with the new safeguard mechanism proposals to the fossil fuel industry could be less than 0.1 per cent of these firms' profits. There is no incentive for them to innovate or invest in new technologies to lower emissions. They can simply buy their way out of actually doing anything. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our climate responds to the amount of greenhouse gases being pumped into the atmosphere. It does not care about accounting tricks or good intentions. To put it bluntly, it is not possible to fully offset the billions of tons of greenhouse gas emissions that come from the burning of fossil fuels by just regrowing forests. Yes, carbon is everywhere on Earth, in the atmosphere, oceans, soils and living beings, and it is being continuously exchanged between them. This exchange is what's known as the active carbon cycle. But burning fossil fuels releases carbon that has been locked away underground for millions of years and puts tons of new carbon into the active carbon cycle. No matter how many trees we plant, this new carbon can never be locked away underground again. It goes on to remain part of the active cycle. This is why the science tells us that the phasing out of fossil fuels is the No. 1 action needed to hold our planet from cooking and mitigate these climate disasters. But there are 117 new coal and gas projects in the investment pipeline, and both Liberal and Labor's climate and energy plans are committed to more fossil fuel projects.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Greens want to work with the Labor government to get real tangible action on addressing climate change. We know this can be done, because we've done it before. The last time Labor came to the table and worked with the Greens, we were able to get the Clean Energy Finance Corporation, a price on carbon that actually made the fossil fuel industry pay for the damage it causes to our planet, and the establishment of the Australian Renewable Energy Agency. The result: the biggest decrease in pollution we have seen and $20 billion in investment across 600 renewable projects across the country. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Real climate action is what is required to save our environment, our economy and our future. We can repair our reputation on the world stage, stop our Pacific neighbours from experiencing mass displacement, and become global leaders in renewable energy and sustainability. Real climate action is 100 per cent publicly owned renewable energy and the rollout of domestic renewable manufacturing and infrastructure. It's investing in public transport and restoring our natural environment. Real climate action is ending the $11 billion a year of public subsidies for the fossil fuel industry. This amounts to the government handing over a staggering $20,000 every minute of every day to an industry profiting off environmental demise. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Real climate action is electrification of our homes and businesses, removing our reliance on gas and ensuring energy security and reducing our power bills. Real climate action is showing the world that Australia is able to kick our reliance on fossil fuels and embrace our future as a renewable energy superpower. Real action on climate is no new coal and gas. </span>

There were the usual lines from the Greens about the Labor Party and telling everyone about how bad they think we are. But what the Greens aren't telling you is that we have actually been negotiating for weeks in good faith, sitting down with the crossbench and the Greens, with anyone who wants to try and get a deal done on the safeguard mechanism policy, to work in good faith like adults for the interests of the Australian people. That might not be in the political lines being run by the Greens at the moment, but that's fine. They're going to run their lines, they're going to play their politics on climate because that's in their DNA. What we're going to do is try to get some action on climate change. </span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This safeguard mechanism is the single-biggest lever that any government has ever tried to pull in the history of our country in reducing our emissions. I would have thought that the Greens want to be a part of that and I would have thought the Greens' tone is really important when talking about progress in this place. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm proud, on this side of the House, to be part of a government that is trying to take the single largest leap forward in emissions reduction in our country's history. That's what the safeguard mechanism is all about, and we have tried to do it in a way that is always the challenge of those in the Labor Party—to bring together those who live in the real world—industry and businesses—while also bringing together those who want to see action on climate and want to see Australia take a leadership role in tackling our rising emissions. That's what this mechanism does. There are multiple parts to it. The first part, the baseline crediting system, is set out in this legislation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The whole philosophy behind the safeguard mechanism scheme is to make the 215 largest emitters across our country reduce their emissions by an average of around five per cent each and every year—five per cent next year, five per cent the year after and so on. That is a big task for some of these facilities, which have never had such intense policy placed on them. We need to bring people with us, and we need to ensure that we are implementing a policy that actually reduces emissions, one that industry cannot ignore.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What's really important is that the baseline crediting system incentivises businesses for emissions reduction. If a business or a facility is able to reduce its emissions by more than the five per cent, the crediting system will allow it to sell its legitimate emissions reduction efforts. It's a way of saying to a business, 'If you go beyond the emissions reductions that are required as per the safeguard mechanism scheme, you can be incentivised for that.' It also creates a market where other businesses can purchase those credits. It's a really sensible scheme. It incentivises emissions reduction. It creates a market for businesses that require offsets, where it is harder for particular facilities to reduce emissions, and for those that are able to successfully go beyond the baseline crediting.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This scheme also works with the framework that was set up by the previous government. While that framework's baseline levels were too weak and it didn't actually bring down emissions, the fundamentals of incentivising large emitters to reduce their emissions were actually an idea that was cooked up by those opposite. In this new culture of the coalition wanting to oppose every single aspect of climate and emissions reduction policy, they're now voting against the very thing that they helped create. Anyway, that's the world that we live in. That's the world where the coalition has decided to be. That's the world where those on the other side of the chamber are not recognising the fact that a number of seats that used to be held by their colleagues are now held by the crossbench, or by Labor—a number of seats that no-one in the history of the Labor Party ever thought that we would hold but we proudly hold. Those opposite are living in a world where they are denying the need to tackle climate change. It is, politically, a very dark place for them. They seem not to have learned that lesson, but far be it from me to stop them. Don't interrupt your opponents when they're making a mistake—I think that's the old saying.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So the first aspect is the baseline crediting system, where we're incentivising business to go beyond the five per cent emissions reductions required for each facility. Other aspects that will be part of the safeguard mechanism will be predominantly effected through regulation, but it is all important to this particular policy. There are other credits that can be accessed, and I think there are important discussions going on that will give confidence to the Australian people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to take this moment to acknowledge the many conversations that I have had with peak bodies, with experts and with representatives from organisations like the Climate Council—first-class civil society organisations who are working tirelessly to make sure that this policy is everything that it needs to be. I want to thank those in the environmental and climate movement who have spent time with me, especially up here in Canberra but, even more so, in my electorate. I am so proud that in Macnamara we have people who are civic-minded and who know that we are part of the last generation that can tackle climate change in a meaningful way and that we must be a part of the solution. I have always said yes to any local group that seeks to meet with me on this matter because not only does it help me to better represent the people in my electorate but also it helps me to understand and to hear from some of the most articulate and thoughtful people who live in my electorate. I am proud to be their representative and I'm proud to be an MP in this place who will always push for more climate action and for more efforts to reduce our emissions as quickly as possible. We need to make sure that we are providing confidence to those people—and to all people, including industry—about the integrity of our offset system, and those really important discussions are happening right now that will ensure that people have confidence in this scheme.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Under the scheme, each and every facility is going to be required to reduce their emissions by five per cent. It's absolutely essential that we implement the safeguard mechanism if we are going to hit our 43 per cent emissions reduction targets. We cannot keep wasting time in this place. It must be the case that, at every single opportunity to make a difference and progress climate action and climate policy in this place, we take a step forward, and this safeguard mechanism scheme is an almighty step forward. It does deal with the total quantum of emissions that are allowed as part of the safeguard facility and, while the safeguard mechanism scheme can be tweaked in the years to come, it is really important that we get the foundations laid this year and as quickly as possible. That's because, if we are to hit our 2030 emission reduction targets, we need to make sure that we have all of the levers in place. It's not just me saying that. In the conversations that I've had with a lot of those bodies that are seeking to make progress, everyone—not those characters opposite, but all of the serious people—fundamentally agrees that having the safeguard mechanism system in place is a huge improvement on the current regime that we inherited from those opposite.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is important reform. This is reform that will ensure that businesses and facilities are reducing their emissions. This is reform that will make one of the most important contributions to our 2030 emissions reduction target and is also going to provide certainty for businesses who operate in difficult environments. It is very difficult for some of the businesses and facilities that we're talking about to reduce emissions. We're talking about facilities that produce concrete. There is a facility that is a lithium mine. We need these sorts of minerals in order to create batteries and create the sorts of products that we need on our pathway towards net zero, but the actual mining of lithium is an extremely emissions-intensive process. Therefore, we need to do everything we can to reduce the amount of emissions as part of that, because we are going to need a lot of lithium and other critical minerals to be able to create batteries, solar panels and wind farms. We're going to need minerals to be able to create the sorts of products that we need to have a more sustainable and more renewable future. That's why we need to work with industry. It's really important that we get this right.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the final part of my contribution, I will just reiterate where I started. It is extraordinary that, since the government came into office, the coalition have made the determination that they are not interested in climate change and emissions reduction. They suffered extraordinary losses at the last election. No-one in the last election lost to a candidate who was offering lower emissions reduction targets—no-one. The politics of this seems to be completely lost on those opposite. They've dealt themselves out of this conversation.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberContinuation">Mr BURNS:</span>
                    </a>  I can hear people laughing. Well, you're laughing on the other side of the chamber, and long may you laugh over there, friends. Laugh over there for as long as you want, because we on this side of the House, on the side of the treasury bench, understand that Australians' expectations have moved on from your outdated ways—or from their outdated ways, Deputy Speaker. We are here as the party of government, working collaboratively and constructively with the crossbench and even—despite what they tell you, despite some of the public ranting and raving that the Greens have been doing recently—with the Greens, because we want to get this done. We want to take the biggest step forward in emissions reduction policy in our country's history.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We need this safeguard mechanism to work. We want to make sure that this scheme is an effective one to actually reduce our emissions, to hit our emissions reduction targets and to give businesses certainty so that we can produce materials like batteries, wind farms and solar panels. Ideally, we will manufacture some of them in Australia, but that is a separate piece of work being led by the excellent minister for industry. We need to get this program in place so that we can actually hit our emissions reduction targets.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">So I would urge all members of this place, including those who helped design some of the aspects of this scheme themselves, to get on board or to forever be consigned to the wrong side of history on climate action. People are going to judge them at the next election: did they do one thing in opposition to help tackle climate change? Did they support one out of the many things that we put forward in this place to help tackle emissions? From the responses that I've received while making these remarks, my hopes are not too high. But we on this side of the House know that we must do our bit. We must reduce our emissions. This policy, the safeguard mechanism policy, both through this legislation and through the regulations that will be outlined by the Minister for Climate Change and Energy, is the single largest lever the government has ever tried to pull in Australia's history on emissions reduction. It is one that we must get right. It is one that we must get going in the interests of our nation.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hinkler</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:58</span>):  I really have to answer a couple of those points very briefly. The Nationals held all 15 of their seats and gained a senator. In Queensland the Labor Party did nothing but lose seats and go backwards. So for those opposite to pretend that this is some great mandate is absolutely false. The people who drive our economy in the regions, and in Queensland in particular, did not agree with the proposition.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We come to the Safeguard Mechanism (Crediting) Amendment Bill 2022. The bill intends to have 215 businesses that are impacted by the safeguard mechanism reduce their emissions over a period of 10 years. That includes 66 coalmines, 36 gas facilities, 26 iron ore mines and 49 manufacturing facilities, two of which are the last two remaining oil refineries in this country, which are already in trouble because Labor broke their promise on fuel and emissions standards in this country and they now cannot meet those standards in the future. I went to the Parliamentary Library and said, 'Okay, the federal Labor Party is going to do this to the people that we represent, particularly in the regions, particularly manufacturing, particularly resources, which drive literally hundreds of billions of dollars worth of our economy. How is it going to work?' I said to the library, 'Give me a rule of thumb. Tell me what might happen in terms of offsets and available protocols and all of these other things.' This legislation proposes a $75 carbon tax—three times the Rudd-Gillard level—and a penalty of $275 for those organisations on the list. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Can you imagine what it would be like to be 49 manufacturing facilities who have legacy equipment which they either have to completely replace or find an alternative to offset? If we look at the options to offset, unfortunately the Parliamentary Library told me they couldn't find a data source. But my colleague and friend the member for Flynn found one: the CSIRO's <span style="font-style:italic;">Australia's carbon sequestration potential</span><span style="font-style:italic;">: a</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> stocktake and analysis of</span><span style="font-style:italic;"></span><span style="font-style:italic;">sequestration technologies</span><span style="font-style:italic;">,</span> November 2022. This is based on existing protocols, practices, methodologies and costs, and it is actually quite an interesting and detailed report. If we look at the potential for that, the library itself tells us that Australia's total land mass is around 768 million hectares. Of that, the agricultural area is 426 million hectares and urban intensive areas are about 3.5 million hectares. On top of all the other commitments that the federal Labor government has made, they have also made one, under the High Ambition Coalition for Nature and People, to protect 30 per cent of the world's land areas and seas to halt the loss of species et cetera. To do that from where Australia is currently positioned is going to take, I'm told, another 60 million hectares. So we have 60 million hectares to go to that proposal, and then somehow these organisations have to find offsets or equivalents to meet what you are legislating in this place. Or they have some other options—I'll get to that soon. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">If we look at these options as per the CSIRO report, we have, Labor is saying, a 43 per cent reduction of CO2 by 2030 that is legislated. There are various reports about how much that might be but it's north of 200 million tonnes of CO2 and, as I said, 426 million hectares of ag land. This report runs through the types of protocols that currently exist, and nearly all of these that I'm about to speak about have to go into cleared or nearly cleared agricultural land: permanent plantings, not-for-harvest woody vegetation, previously cleared ag land. There are two eligible methodologies. The CSIRO report talks about potential and technical outcomes, with 'potential' being as much as they think they can possibly get from this protocol and methodology and 'technical' being what they think is realistic. So 480 million tonnes of CO2 reduction under this methodology would require 63 million hectares of agricultural land. They say that that's probably not reasonable, and I would probably agree with that. The technical outcome will be 16 million tonnes of CO2 from three million hectares of land. These are all numbers that sound interesting. What is three million hectares? Just to get people who are listening some idea of the scope, the entire Australian sugar industry is farmed from just over 350,000 hectares. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Commercial plantations and farm forestry would be, technically, 42 million tonnes of CO2, but that would require five per cent of existing ag land. Human induced regeneration of native forest, including reduction in the rates of domestic livestock grazing, would be 60 million tonnes of CO2 off 32 million hectares. You can avoid land clearing. That'll give you nine million tonnes of CO2 off 1.38 million hectares. Savannah management, which I acknowledge is not ag land, will potentially have six million tonnes reduction off 80 million hectares. Soil carbon will potentially be technically 115 million tonnes of CO2, but they're unsure exactly how much that will require because it is complex in the way that it actually evolves and works and is paid and subsidised and everything else. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a range of others, whether that is blue carbon—mangroves, tidal marshes, coastal wetlands, seagrass. There's a whole heap of all sorts of epiphanies and unicorns down in the garden. But the big one is geological storage—carbon capture and storage in existing geology. I say that because the technical potential by 2050 is 227 gigatonnes of CO2. That is an enormous amount of CO2.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The report also talks about just how strong this storage is. It won't leak. It's proven by millions of years of experience—for example, in exhausted gas basins. If you store in depleted hydrocarbon fields, you can store CO2 for millions of years. And this is what has happened; this where we have accumulated gas and everything else that we utilise. The member for Flynn has been a strong advocate for this, but not into the Great Artesian Basin. You cannot put waste into the GAB, but there are proposals out there that I and others are aware of to inject liquid CO2 into the Great Artesian Basin's aquifers. I'm 100 per cent opposed. It will make them unpotable. The proposal to inject liquid CO2 into the greatest water source in this country should be prohibited but currently is not.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are a number of others, whether it's direct air capture or a whole pile of other fantasies, that may or may not work. The CSIRO has summarised the available methodologies, roughly what the cost is and how much land or other mechanisms are needed. If we add these up—permanent planning, three million hectares; farmed forestry, 21 million hectares; human induced regeneration, 32 million hectares; avoided land clearing, one million hectares; savanna management et cetera—you only get to 133 million tonnes of CO2. If they utilise all of these, they will be roughly 100 million tonnes short. Can you imagine taking that much land out of production in Australia? That is the only proposal and it's on cleared or partially cleared agricultural land used for food production.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have seen the ag sector go from strength to strength. In fact, the forecast is that it will put some $90 billion into the economy. They are not only feeding Australia; they are feeding the world. But the safeguard mechanism that Labor is putting forward is saying to these organisations, 'You will pay a penalty, whether that $75 or $275 a tonne that you are over your target, year by year by year, unless you find another way.'</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some of these assets are worth billions of dollars. Why on earth would they rebuild them in the form that people on that side of this building, the government side, want at an enormous cost with no real outcome? The alternative is that they can take up some of these potentials. Is that the proposition? Is what's being proposed by those opposite that literally tens of millions of hectares of Australian ag land gets taken up for offsets to meet your targets under the safeguard mechanism in a country that contributes just one per cent of the world's emissions? And that has dropped by some 20 per cent recently. This is the definition of insanity. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have to feed ourselves; we have to feed the world. To do that we require good sources of water; we require good farming techniques. Australian farmers are recognised as the best in the world, but the concept that we will take all of this land into offsets—and let's not kid ourselves. Big companies like Telstra and others can afford to do this. They will just go and buy ag land—it's what happened under the ERF with previous governments—and they will let it go to waste. They don't need to maintain fences. They don't need to keep out ferals. They don't need to employ anyone, particularly in regional Queensland, regional Australia and the far-flung areas of our country. What that means is no-one's at school, no-one volunteers for the fire brigade, no-one's paying rates, no-one is employed, no-one has houses. This is exactly what has happened under previous proposals.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The concept that Australia will turn into somewhere which is not managed—can you imagine the chaos if those farmers are out there getting paid to simply not farm? And yet that is the proposition being put forward by those opposite in this safeguard mechanism. These companies employ tens of thousands—hundreds of thousands—of Australians. The resources sector alone is accountable for over one million Australians directly and indirectly employed. They are highly competitive in a world market providing a product that the world wants. Yet we see this mad charge to 2030 to meet targets that have been set that could impact not only Australia's agricultural production but Australia's water production from the GAB, Australia's economic options, and jobs in regional Australia.</span>
                </p>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We shouldn't kid ourselves. Every single big business I know is doing the numbers right now to determine at what point in the future they become unviable under these proposals, then whether, at that point, they close. That will get you your CO2 reductions. There's no doubt about that, because there'll be none. There'll also be no jobs. There'll be no options in the future. There'll be no training of apprentices. There'll be no-one contributing to the local economy. There'll be no-one going to the hairdresser or to the bakery or going to the shopping centres, because those jobs will not exist. This is the exact point we are at right now. The idea is that some businesses will be able to afford to offset 200 million tonnes per year—and I've outlined that they're not even going to get to that—with enormous amounts of land. If you include the savannah management, it's 137 million hectares. It is enormous. These are huge swathes of our country. It will change the dynamic of regional Australia forever.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There has to be a better way. The better way is carbon capture and storage, because it works. It works and it can do very, very large amounts of CO2 sequestration, in the right place. In fact, I know that the Barossa proposal, offshore from the Northern Territory, was looking at exactly that. Santos was looking at utilising existing lines for CO2 injection at depleted gas outputs, where the fields have been depleted and they had the option to do that. They will get paid for it, clearly. But what have we seen? We've seen the new Barossa project stopped by the Environmental Defenders Office through the Federal Court. We've seen all of those people stood down. We've seen a company like Santos, an Australian company—which I'm told has expended over $2.4 billion on this project already—now having it parked up and not moving forward. That were 600 jobs alone in the extension of the Darwin LNG program. This is significant for the Northern Territory. They're trying to do the right thing, but you have to give them the option to do it in the time frame that works for them. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The 30 years to 2050 is a very, very long way away. Think about it. How many businesses can you think of that last three decades or that last five decades? There really aren't that many, because longevity in business is incredibly difficult. Yet here we see a proposal which is going to force businesses to the wall earlier than would be expected and will force them to make a decision on their viability earlier than they need to. Jobs will be lost in the regions. I've got the member for Flynn sitting next to me. I can tell you where most of them will be. They'll be in Gladstone, in the member for Flynn's electorate. They'll be around aluminium and concrete and energy. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is the wrong proposal. It is the wrong approach. A $275 penalty for those who can't find a way—otherwise they're out buying up ag land across the country to give them offsets. We know that this will not work. It is bad for the regions. It gives a terrible outcome for communities. It's the equivalent of buying water from the Murray-Darling Basin and taking it out of the economy. Guess what? That's what the Labor Party is doing because they are tied up in their ideological views. These are not practical outcomes. They can be done and managed in a much better way. Use the technologies that come online. Give them the time to deliver what they need to. Let them design and move forward in a way that keeps their businesses profitable, keeps their employees in place and keeps the business in town—in regional Australia, in particular. The people in the cities will know the impact because they will have to pay the price, and the price will go up for just about everything. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I come back to these 215 businesses, which, in my view, will be just the start. The 100,000-tonne limit can be easily changed by the minister with a single stroke of a pen. I expect to see that in the future. I oppose the bill. I oppose it strongly and will continue to do that into the future.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fraser</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:13</span>):  Taking action on climate change has been described as dealing with a problem that represents a tragedy of the commons on a global scale. It is truly a wicked policy problem. It is wicked and complicated because of the interdependency of all the different actors involved. It is a global challenge in which all of our actions affect everybody else. It's no surprise that one of the key texts on this, written by the Nobel Prize winner who was a leading developer of integrated assessment models, is a book titled <span style="font-style:italic;">Manag</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ing</span><span style="font-style:italic;"> the </span><span style="font-style:italic;">Global </span><span style="font-style:italic;">C</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ommons</span>. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an incredibly difficult challenge that requires countries and communities around the world to take action. Not only is it complicated; it is a problem that requires a solution. It is not just complicated but necessary that we take action, because in the absence of action this planet will become far less livable. Societies and communities around the world will see their living standards collapse.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While it is necessary for us to take action, it is also an opportunity for us when we take action. It is an opportunity in the sense that we will be improving our environment, investing in new technologies and investing in our long-term quality of life. That is why there is a transformation going on around the world. That is why countries all around the world are embracing abatement, adopting standards and taking action together. There is a revolution going on that is technological, social and regulatory, and we have stood on the sidelines of this revolution for too long. For a decade, we have used trite, mealy-mouthed statements like, 'We're going to adopt the Australian way'—meaningless statements which really described inaction rather than anything which reflected true Australian values. We used trite comments like 'the adoption of technology rather than taxes', when in fact we've wasted a decade with no real, meaningful regulatory change.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we see from those opposite during this debate is a claim that they now recognise that action needs to be taken, belatedly, but what they say is that whatever particular solution we put forward is all too hard or won't work. Whether we put forward legislated net zero, 43 per cent or a strengthened safeguard mechanism, those opposite are simply left saying that it won't work or it's all too hard. They've gone from saying we don't need to take action to saying we can't take action. The last speaker just gave us a litany of reasons why it's all going to be so hard. It's a ridiculous approach to a problem when the solutions are out there and when people in government, civil society and corporations are fighting for solutions every day but when we need to strengthen our regulatory arrangements to make it easier for them. Those opposite have gone from being ostriches to being defeatists, and both approaches are inappropriate given the challenges that we face.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to just lay out a couple of general principles, because these are absolutely critical when it comes to dealing with this problem and laying out the right regulatory response. The first principle is that, when we are undergoing a technological, social and economic challenge and transformation as big as this, it's always better to start early—to start as early as possible. The later you leave this, the harder it is going to be. Second, if we're going to get the best outcomes, it's going to be by leveraging investment through certainty in regulatory arrangements, leveraging investment in research and development and leveraging investment in capital. Third, integrity in regulatory arrangements is absolutely critical. Fourth, abatement should occur broadly across the economy. As a general principle, it is going to be less costly the broader abatement is and the more sectors it touches on. It will be more costly if you focus more narrowly. Fifth, abatement, where possible, should be at least cost.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government's first major approaches in this area, at the beginning of this term, were to legislate net zero and to legislate 43 per cent by 2030. That goes right to the heart of a couple of those principles that I laid out just then—first, that you need to start early. We came to government after 10 years of complete inaction when it came to setting targets, so the first thing we did was to set a target. We didn't really want to start where we were. If somebody were giving us directions to get to net zero, they probably would have said, 'I wouldn't start where you are.' But we are where we are, and the best thing we can do is to start as early as possible. The second thing is leveraging private sector and public sector investment with certainty, and that's exactly what we did by legislating net zero and 43 per cent. So we, right from the start, have been approaching this problem with those core principles in mind.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now we go to the safeguard mechanism, which is going to see abatement from 215 of our largest polluters—just under 30 per cent of total emissions—setting up an arrangement where they will abate their emissions by roughly 4.9 per cent per year until 2030. That is absolutely critical in terms of reflecting those other principles I laid out—that abatement should be broad. We don't want all the abatement on just one part of the economy. We can't achieve 43 per cent if we achieve abatement just through energy production or just through transport or just through one sector. It's going to be better for our economy, for our society, for our standards of living, if we achieve abatement broadly across the economy. It's entirely appropriate that the safeguard mechanism is going to be strengthened so as to bring in these over 200 large emitters. Under the previous government, there had been a safeguard mechanism of sorts, but it didn't bite. It may as well not have been there for most of the firms within it. It didn't offer the breadth of abatement that our strengthened scheme will.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The other key thing is that abatement should be least cost where possible, and that's where offsets are so important. The previous speaker gave some examples of where he thinks certain types of offsets may be difficult in practice, but is he seriously arguing that we shouldn't have offsets or is he arguing that somehow every other country is moving towards net zero but it's going to be oh-so-hard for us: 'We're only one per cent. We're different. Let's not bother'? It really is a crazy argument, particularly given where our society have said they want governments to take them. But abatement at least cost is going to require offsets, and that's why it's such a critically important part of this scheme that offsets be set up in a rigorous way. I'll deal with the offsets regime and how it's been supported by a rigorous report later on in my contribution.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite, as I said, have shifted their rhetoric from, 'It's not really necessary,' to, 'It's all too hard.' But their rhetoric doesn't reflect that of any major segment in our society or any major set of stakeholders, whether it be business, civil society, the scientific community or, frankly, the electorate more broadly. Let's look at what the Business Council of Australia said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">But without policy certainty and policy realism, we run the risk of another five to 10 years of delay and inaction.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When they say 'another 10 years of inaction', I know very clearly which 10 years of inaction they're referring to—the 10 years we're just coming out of. They're saying that, if we don't take realistic action that strengthens our regulatory arrangements, we are at risk of repeating the disastrous 10 years we're just coming out of:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We support the reform Safeguard Mechanism's objectives to achieve a net zero emissions economy which delivers new industries, new exports, new jobs, new opportunities and better living standards.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Business Council of Australia backs in all the objectives this strengthened arrangement sets out.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What about the Australian Industry Group:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">We want this mechanism to work as it's important to industrial investment and emissions reduction.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, this is clearly alluding to the fact that, unless we set up stronger regulatory arrangements, we are not going to have the certainty necessary for investment and, secondly, that if we're going to have least-cost abatement we are going to have to abate broadly across the economy and have to do so in a way where offsets are possible.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition's decision to vote against changes it had previously proposed and the reported Greens positioning once again make Australia look incapable of reaching agreement on how to utilise assets and build economic success. The unholy alliance that might be occurring—the train wreck that might be occurring right in front of our eyes—between those who don't believe and those who want perfection over any realistic solution might again put us back in a situation where, despite the result at the last election, we might be faced with another 10 years of inaction. That would be a disaster for our environment, for our economy and for our society.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What about Amanda McKenzie, the Climate Council CEO:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The Federal Government's reform of the Safeguard Mechanism is a critical opportunity to deliver the right policy settings to help future-proof industries, protect Australian manufacturing, and reduce harmful carbon pollution.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, we need to strengthen the safeguard mechanism from the form it took under the previous government, where it wasn't biting. It wasn't leading to abatement. It wasn't doing what it was supposed to. It wasn't spreading abatement more broadly across the economy, because it wasn't leading to change across a wide range of stakeholders. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This takes me to carbon offsets and carbon credit units. It is important to recognise that the task of abatement will not be equal across all of those 215 firms. So we recognise that it is critical that there be mechanisms whereby offsets can be purchased where it's not possible for firms to achieve abatement on site within a certain period of time. That is absolutely standard, rigorous, best-practice regulatory policy. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to take us for a moment to the Chubb report, released in December 2022, which has made very clear, when it comes to the integrity standards of offsets that are being proposed, that they stack up. Firstly, I want to talk about the fact that the method for determining the integrity of offsets has six elements: there must be additionality; there must be measurable and verifiable removal of emissions; it has to be an eligible carbon abatement; it has to be evidence based; any material emissions that are a direct consequence of carrying out the project should be deducted from the project's net abatement; and any estimates should be conservative. So it's a very strong framework that we're talking about. And what we find is that the human induced regeneration, the HIR, method is found to be sound. It meets the OIS, the offsets integrity standards, that I just described and is a rigorous way of achieving offsets. This is absolutely critical. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Secondly, when it comes to accounting for carbon sequestration in the human induced regeneration method, the Chubb report says: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">The current model-based estimation of carbon sequestration using FullCAM is a suitable basis for estimating aggregate carbon storage in native vegetation, when applied appropriately at the project level. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I do think it's important to stress that the offsets mechanism that is being proposed is rigorous. It will lead to real abatement. But it is also critical to acknowledge that it is necessary because not all of the firms in this scheme are going to have the same potential to produce abatement in the next two, three, five or whatever number of years. This is exactly the kind of scheme that the economy needs. It's going to spread abatement, but it's also going to move towards a system where abatement is more least-cost. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an absolutely critical and overdue reform. What we are facing is one of the great regulatory and environmental challenges the world has seen in modern times, certainly in the times of modern human civilisation. It is a diabolical problem, because it's affected by all countries and there are all sorts of regulatory challenges, including coordination challenges and free-rider challenges. That's why it's so critical not only that governments regulate abatement within economies but also that governments of goodwill negotiate with each other internationally and take coordinated action globally. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What this government has done since taking office less than 10 months ago is that we have set upon the task immediately of putting in place an overarching architecture. We have put in place a net zero commitment in legislation. We have put in place a 43 per cent target in legislation. That will provide certainty. That will provide the earliest possible start. This is going to be built on by the safeguard mechanism, which is going to provide abatement that is spread more broadly across the economy and abatement that is least-cost. This is the action that our society and our economy need. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Flynn</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:29</span>):  I rise to make a contribution on the Safeguard Mechanism (Crediting) Amendment Bill 2022. I would like to make a comment on the previous member's contribution, and that is that all of the speakers from the other side that I've heard do not qualify or quantify the effects or the results of what they're proposing with this legislation. And the results will be enormous. They will be huge. None of them understand where they're going with it. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Basically the safety net mechanism is a tax—that's what it is—a carbon tax. If the Labor Party is good at one thing, it's imposing tax on our businesses, on our industries, on the Australian people. They're proposing to implement a 10 per cent increase on the transport industry through fuel excise increases and registration increases. There have been proposals on a superannuation tax on single-entity self-managed funds. There's also a franking credit tax. They are very good at imposing taxes. In respect of the safety net mechanism, in my electorate of Flynn there are 18 businesses that will be directly affected, those businesses emitting over 100,000 tonnes of carbon. In my neighbouring electorate of Capricornia there are 28 businesses, so of all of the businesses approximately 30 per cent are in Central Queensland. They are all related to heavy industry: to the coal industry, to the power generation sector, to the alumina sector, to the gas sector, to everything that generates income for the economy of Australia, and the ramifications are huge. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The ramifications of this tax have not been quantified by those opposite, and they don't know how to do so because they don't know where they're going with it. I have spoken to many of the proponents that are involved—not all of them—and one thread in the conversations that I had with them is common: where are we going to get the carbon offsets from, and how much are they going to cost us? There is a $75 cap on the price of carbon, and there is a $275 impost if they can't meet those carbon offsets of five per cent every year from now to 2030. The reality is they don't really know where they are going. They don't know how much it's going to cost them. They don't know how much in carbon offsets is available. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Hinkler has rightly pointed out that they're looking at agriculture, to buy up agricultural land all over Australia, millions of hectares of productive agricultural land, to look for carbon offsets. There are other proposals—carbon sequestration, for example—and there is a proposal that I'm sure many are not aware of, and that is that Glencore, the largest coalminer in Australia, inject liquefied CO2 hypercritical fluid into the water aquifers of the Great Artesian Basin. They have a trial site at Moonie, near me in Darra, in the western Darling Downs. According to their papers, the test project they're proposing will cause 266,368 tonnes of carbon dioxide. They are proposing to inject 330,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide into the Great Artesian Basin test site, for a net yield of 57,000 tonnes. They also say in their technical water report that any injection site that they have and a zone around it will effectively render that water source useless. They say in their technical water report:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Future users should not be allowed to take groundwater supply from the zone impacted by the plume (Precipice Sandstone aquifer). This should include a zone around the impacted area from which water might be extracted by a well installed outside of the immediate residual impact zone. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They also say in their report that the waste is likely to result in the deterioration of the environmental values of the receding groundwater, so they are admitting that they cannot meet the environmental standards. What they are proposing in Queensland is to change the EP regulations to allow them to do this. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The problem I have with that is that, if those environmental regulations are changed—and I am talking about section 41(2C) of the regulations—that would open the gate for anybody and everybody to do the same thing. There are 215 companies that emit over 100,000 tonnes of carbon, and it is difficult to identify where these carbon offsets are going to come from and how much they are going to cost these companies if they can't meet those regulations imposed by this safety net mechanism. They will possibly look to carbon sequestration technology, and if those EP regulations are changed it will have an enormous effect on the greatest water source on the planet. The Great Artesian Basin is unique. It is one of a kind; there is only one of them. It's the same as the Great Barrier Reef. It is the outback's Great Barrier Reef. It is estimated to carry 65,000 cubic kilometres of fresh water. It covers 22 per cent of the area of Australia over four states. It covers 71 per cent of the area of Queensland, and it is the lifeblood of agricultural Australia. I am vehemently against anybody putting liquefied hypercritical fluid into the waters of the Great Artesian Basin. If I can borrow from Macbeth, 'They shall hack the flesh from my bones before I give up on this issue.' It's not happening on my watch. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There are other issues in respect of this safety net mechanism, and that's the hypocrisy that surrounds the whole thing. Why is the renewable energy industry not included in this safety net mechanism? Everybody thinks that, as we move to the future and achieve 43 per cent carbon emissions, we're going to rely on wind farms, solar farms and alternative energy sources for our power. They are under some delusional idea that none of these industries create carbon. Well, they do. There's concrete, there's steel, there are plastics; there are all sorts of things. The member for Brisbane, in his contribution, wants to turn away from all of these fossil fuels. How on earth are you going to feed the world if you don't have gas to make fertiliser? If you do not have the hydrocarbons, petroleum and oil industries, how do you create plastic? The steel and cement industries, which give us our homes, buildings and roads, are all reliant on the fossil fuel industry. One thing about the Greens' arguments in all of these debates is that they have no alternative whatsoever as to how they're going to solve these problems, if indeed we were to do that. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One other thing that I would like to touch on is a synthetic gas that the renewables and energy sectors use, called SF6, sulphur hexafluoride. It has been identified as being 23,900 times more potent than CO2 in the atmosphere. In Europe, in 2017, it was estimated that the leakage of SF6 was equivalent to the burning of 100 million tonnes of coal. SF6 is used by the electrical industry as an inert gas in switching gear in electric vehicles, wind turbines and all of these things. So I have a question for Mr Bowen in respect of reaching 43 per cent carbon emissions and the fact that he wants to install 40 wind turbines every month between now and 2030, 22,000 solar panels every day between now and 2030, and 28,000 kilometres of high-voltage powerlines between now and 2030 to achieve the 43 per cent emissions target. How much of this SF6, sulphur hexafluoride, is going to be used, and how much of it will leak into the atmosphere? One kilo of sulphur hexafluoride is equivalent to 23,900 kilos of carbon dioxide. Australia produces somewhere in the vicinity of one per cent of world carbon emissions, so what are we actually achieving by implementing this policy? That's where I'm going with this. It doesn't make sense to me. If carbon dioxide is such a terrible gas, why is it that, in a recent meeting with Glencore, CTSCo and the Clean Energy Council, Glencore said to me that their biggest client for compressed carbon dioxide is Coca-Cola? We're putting it into soft drink. We're putting it into beer. What is so dangerous about carbon dioxide?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the other issues is that before the election the Labor Party promised that no coalmine would be impacted by these policies. Obviously, that's not correct. I would say to the coalminers and the resource sector workers in my electorate of Flynn: be mindful of the Labor Party. They do not support your industries and they're after your jobs, and that's exactly what will happen, and the AWU recognises this. They want to implement import duties on all imported goods, because they know this is going to cost jobs. They know that these costs that these big companies incur will be passed on. So I cannot support this bill the way it is, and I would like to hear from those opposite as to how they can qualify the net results of where they're going with the implementation of this bill.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Jagajaga</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:40</span>):  The Safeguard Mechanism (Crediting) Amendment Bill 2022 is a very important bill. It is a very important bill to be speaking on, and I'm very conscious that I am speaking today a day ahead of the release of the sixth IPCC report tomorrow. I've got to say I am dreading that release a little bit, because it's the sixth report, and these reports don't get any better. Each time, the picture gets a little bit more difficult. Each time, we find out more and more about how our climate is changing and about how the time we have to address that is getting shorter and shorter. Each time, the ask gets a bit more urgent. So, when the member opposite asks, 'What's so dangerous about carbon dioxide?' I do encourage him to read that report tomorrow. I think it will set out a lot of those facts he is looking for around what makes it dangerous, what it means for us here in this country and what it means for people around the world.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a genuine problem. It is a genuine problem that this government was elected to do something about because, as we continually hear from those opposite today on this debate, those opposite refused to. For almost a decade, they refused to address climate change, and the consequences of that mean that our country is coming from behind where we should, when we are trying to address this pressing, urgent issue that will affect our country, will affect our economy here, will affect our children's futures, will affect our future and will affect the future of our entire planet. From the get-go, since we were elected, our government has been focused on addressing the challenges climate change poses for Australia and for the world. We understand climate change is a crisis, and we are working to take action on that crisis.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As we do that, we're not doing that because we think we can ignore it. We're not doing it because we think this is a moral obligation. We're doing it because we recognise this is a necessity, and out of that necessity there are opportunities for our country. There are opportunities for our environment, for the climate, for our people, for the future of our country, and for the economy—for good jobs and secure industries of the future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Climate Change Act that our parliament passed in September last year laid the groundwork for climate action going forward. It set our government's target of 43 per cent emissions reduction by 2030 and net zero by 2050. It's putting Australia back at the table in global efforts to reduce climate change. It has done some of the work we needed to do to once again be seen as a responsible player globally, to be seen as someone who is doing our part within a region—our region, the Asia-Pacific—that we know is going to be and already is being particularly impacted by climate change. We are doing the work that puts us back in the conversations about all of that work that is happening internationally—the conversations with allies, with friends and with other countries that we were locked out of for nearly a decade because previous Liberal-National governments refused to take action.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This safeguard mechanism is the next important foundational step forward. It will require our country's largest industrial facilities to reduce their emissions, gradually and predictably, in line with our country's targets. This is a reform that will put Australian industry on the path to net zero by 2050 while also ensuring Australian businesses stay competitive as the world also works towards net zero.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For business and industry, this bill aims to support and encourage industry to unlock emissions reductions where they are most efficient. We know that some businesses do already have low-cost abatement opportunities ready to go and in fact could reduce their emissions faster than is required by the safeguard mechanism. This bill is designed to incentivise such action, enabling these businesses to be issued tradeable safeguard mechanism credits. Other businesses that have more limited abatement options can then buy these credits to help meet their required emissions reductions. Crediting and trading will lower the cost of reducing emissions, helping the safeguard mechanism to meet Australia's climate targets in a cost-effective way and enabling increased ambition over time.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Australian businesses and investors in Australian businesses know that the world is changing. They want to remain competitive in that world, and they know that they need the right signals in place to not just stay competitive but also innovate and thrive. Many businesses that operate facilities that will be covered by the safeguard mechanism have already made long-term climate commitments that match or surpass our country's climate targets. These reforms to the safeguard mechanism will provide strong investment signals for those businesses and provide a balanced scheme that is effective, equitable, efficient and simple. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite all of that, those opposite continue to ignore the realities of climate change. In my home town of Melbourne, we have quite a few electorates that changed hands at the last election. They changed from being Liberal or National seats to teal seats, and some of them changed to Labor seats. One of the key reasons those seats changed was that they saw that those opposite continue to deny that climate change is a reality. Yet even after that really clear message—that the Australian people know this is a reality, that the Australian people know that climate change is real and we need to take action—those opposite continue to come in here and ask questions like, 'What's so bad about carbon dioxide anyway?' They continue to deny. If we still had them in government, we would continue to delay. The opposition is putting our country's future at risk. So long as those opposite continue to refuse to take necessary, sensible, measured action to make reasonable efforts to reduce our climate emissions, they are standing in the way of a future for all of us. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not just the Australian people who have sent this message to the Liberals and Nationals; the Australian business community have also asked them to get on board with the safeguard mechanism. We know the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">Past failure to deal with this reality has crimped certainty for industry and investors, and left our energy sector in disarray. Australian businesses and households are now paying the price.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">They've made it clear they support the reforms to the safeguard mechanism:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This is the best way to secure the planning, investment and innovation that will underpin the decarbonisation of our economy without sacrificing reliability or affordability. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not just them. The Australian Industry Group says that this bill is 'essential policy infrastructure', that it's 'strongly in everyone's interests to pass it' and that it's 'needed for industry investment and for any political party's climate policy vision to work'. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government has listened. We are leading the way on these reforms. We are taking action on climate change. We are working with business and industry so that they can grow and so that they do have a sustainable future in this country, because we absolutely should be a country with industry. We absolutely should be a country that makes things, and that's what this bill and the safeguard mechanism enable. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I understand there are also concerns about how the safeguard mechanism will work to drive down overall emissions. I want to thank the climate groups and the members of my community who have engaged with me so constructively about this. Obviously, as a country we have to make substantial emissions reductions in a relatively short period of time to meet our target of 43 per cent reduction by 2030. I want to be really clear: our government is absolutely dedicated to that task. We know that what we are doing is transforming our country and our economy so that we reap the benefits of being a green energy superpower.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are, of course, coming from behind. We did waste nearly a decade under Liberal-National governments. We won't get there through slogans; we will get there through our government's investments in a clean energy future, through driving the reform we need to transform our economy and through reasonable measures like this safeguard mechanism and this bill. In less than a year since we were elected our government has already demonstrated we are committed to investing in green energy. We know this transformation is one that government can and should play an important role in. We're not standing by and we're not waiting for others to do it; we're stepping forward to work with business and industry and deliver a greener future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have our Rewiring the Nation plan getting underway, with some projects already beginning as part of our $20 billion fund to accelerate the decarbonisation of the grid. This includes in my home state the Marinus Link between Victoria and Tasmania and the Kerang link between Victoria and New South Wales, and both of these projects will help unlock renewables and put downward pressure on energy prices. Alongside this we are making up to $1.5 billion available for renewable energy zones in Victoria and for the development of offshore wind. These are substantial investments in projects that will transform how we power our country. These are good projects, they will deliver us renewable energy and they will deliver us jobs and industries that are sustainable into the future. Our government is delivering $300 million for community batteries and solar banks across the country, and I am very pleased we'll be seeing at least one community battery in Bellfield in my electorate. I think that will be important for the people in that community to have those benefits of renewable energy. I know there's interest from other areas of Jagajaga as well, and I'm happy to keep talking with community members about that. Our government is backing access to sustainable homes with a $125 million investment to encourage homebuilders and renovators to deliver homes with high energy-efficiency standards, including heat pump water systems, electrification and battery-ready solar panels.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Of course it's not just in Victoria; this work is going on right across the country. We have in Brisbane, which the member for Lilley is probably particularly interested in, the development of what could be one of the largest renewable hydrogen production facilities in the world; in Broken Hill, $45 million for a 250-megawatt renewable storage project; $47.5 million to develop a new hydrogen electrolyser in Western Australia; $160 million from the CEFC to fast-track the connection of the country's largest wind farm in Queensland with the national electricity market; and $500 million to help businesses progress innovative projects and technologies to reduce emissions. There are a lot more projects I could go through, but I am conscious of the time. But it gives you a sense of the scale at which this government is trying to operate. We understand the scale of the task before us to transform our economy to make sure it is one that is driven by renewables, that supports Australian businesses and that supports Australian industry, makes sure we are delivering right here the jobs of the future and makes sure we are securing this country's future economically, environmentally and in addressing the climate crisis.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I know the decade of denial and drift under the Liberals and Nationals was something my community were incredibly distressed about. I know they are worried. They too, like me, will see the headlines generated from that sixth IPCC report tomorrow and they will also feel a bit of dread. They will also wonder what the future looks like for their children, their community and of course our entire planet. We have to get this right. We don't get a second chance. We don't get a second world to do this work in. This is the time for this. This mechanism is such a crucial part of the work our government is doing to drive down emissions and to make sure we are transforming our economy and seizing the opportunities of the future, we're not being left behind and we're not being left with a country that is facing increasing natural disasters from an increasingly changing environment. We deserve better than that in this country. We can have better than that in this country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This mechanism has been designed to make sure that we deliver a future that works for our communities, for our industries and for our businesses. It is a sensible, effective measure. It is one that should get support from across this place. This place does not have a good record when it comes to climate change. This is our chance to do better. This is our chance to take our place in history and make sure that we set this country on the right path to make sure that we are looking after our future, our children's future and their children's future. That's what this is about. This is about us being able to achieve those necessary emissions reductions that secure our future.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr WILLCOX</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Dawson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:55</span>):  I rise today to speak on the government's Safeguard Mechanism (Crediting) Amendment Bill 2022. The safeguard mechanism requires Australia's largest greenhouse gas emitters to keep their net emissions below an emissions limit, but the way that Labor has overhauled this policy means there is nothing safe for jobs in this bill, there is nothing safe businesses in this bill and there is nothing safe for the average Australian, who once again will be paying more under Labor.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill, according to the Albanese government, will help Australia achieve net zero emissions by 2050. This bill applies to facilities emitting more than 100,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide per year. We all know that the Albanese government announced it would cut emissions by 43 per cent by 2030. In order to reach the 2030 climate target, the Albanese government is forcing 215 of Australia's biggest businesses to cut emissions by five per cent per year or pay for their emissions output. Almost one-third of these businesses are in Queensland, in the electorates of Flynn and Capricornia, which surround my electorate. There are 28 industry facilities and major businesses affected by this radical and nonsensical tax. Some of these companies are Rio Tinto, Santos, Anglo American, BlueScope Steel, BHP and Glencore. These companies employ thousands of people from across our region. They provide billions of dollars through state royalties. They go into emergency services, our hospitals and schools, and they contribute hundreds of thousands of dollars to our communities through sponsorships, scholarships and donations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Allow me to tell you a little bit about my electorate. Mackay, in the south of Dawson, is the base for many mineworkers who travel over the hill into Capricornia or Flynn to work for the companies I have mentioned—not for fun but to earn a living. While thousands of our hardworking men and women go out west to work, their families and their homes are in Mackay. Not only is Mackay home to many mining and manufacturing workers; it's also a maintenance hub for the mining companies. It's not just the mineworkers and their families that rely on these jobs. Small businesses rely on people having jobs, and our house prices and investments rely on people having jobs. In order to have a healthy and thriving economy, people need to have jobs. We learnt this in school.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's easy to see how reliant a place like Mackay is on the coal and manufacturing industries, but the Albanese government's extreme climate targets and the way it intends to meet them put all of these jobs in jeopardy. They put real estate investment in jeopardy, they put small business in jeopardy, and they put our children's future in jeopardy. This is typical Labor: create a problem, invent a tax for hardworking Australians, and then try to fix it. It doesn't make any sense.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For the past few minutes I've been telling the House what the Labor government wants you to believe the safeguard mechanism is and then what I believe it actually to be. You know the old saying: if it waddles like a duck and quacks like a duck, it's probably a duck. So let's call it for what it is. It's a tax on families, a tax on businesses and a big tax on regional Australia. It's carbon tax 2.0 and another major blow for the people of Australia and, more specifically, for the people of rural and regional Australia. It greatly concerns me that the Albanese Labor government is happily executing drastic climate targets with no consideration for the toll it takes on Australian jobs and on household budgets, at a time when the cost of living is skyrocketing, with increased mortgage rates, increased overdrafts for businesses, increased food and fuel costs and increased energy prices. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Leading up to the 2022 federal election, Prime Minister Albanese and his party promised there would be no carbon tax. Labor promised that not a single Australian coalmine would be impacted by their policy to reduce carbon emissions. But, after the election, the Albanese government says that any new gas or coal project will automatically come under the remit of the mechanism. We all know that the good folk in Central and Northern Queensland did not fall for the Labor promises at the 2022 federal election, and now you can see why. We are the type of hard-working, common-sense people who can see straight through porky pies. This is another broken Labor promise.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Central and North Queenslanders understood the coalition's sensible approach of achieving net zero by 2050 and delivering this in a responsible way that balances emissions reduction with economic growth. The coalition government mapped out a plan to achieve net zero by 2050 without new taxes. The coalition believes in technology, not taxes. In government, the coalition committed $22 billion to bring down the cost of low-emission technologies—that is, hydrogen, ultra-low-cost solar, green steel and aluminium—leveraging up to $132 billion in private sector investment and supporting over 160,000 jobs. Once these technologies are cost competitive with the existing alternative, people will voluntarily make the change. Now, I'll tell you this much: at the rate we're headed, there won't be much of the Australian dream left in a couple of years.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are seeing how the effects of taxes are affecting investment in Queensland right now. Major miner BHP will not make any significant new investments in Queensland due to the state government's coal royalty tax. There is a strong long-term demand from global steelmakers for Queensland's high-quality metallurgical coal. But we are being told that, in the absence of good government policy that is both competitive and predictable, companies are unable to commit to significant new investments in Queensland. Senex Energy's $1 billion investment plan to bring new gas to the east coast is at risk. BHP has also put plans for the Blackwater South mine in Central Queensland on hold for the foreseeable future. The Palaszczuk Labor government have firmly shot our state right in the foot with their coal royalties, and now the Albanese government is trying to do the same. Queensland businesses are set to pay an extra $4 billion in tax with Labor's carbon tax. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our mining and resource sector is the No. 1 contributor to keeping our nation afloat, the No. 1 regional employer and the No. 1 industry for export dollars. This industry supports over 450,000 jobs for Queenslanders and 14,000-plus businesses, all of whom pay tax to help fund hospitals, schools, roads, our NDIS and all other government services. The thanks the industry and the workers get is to pay more tax and prop up a bloated Canberra bureaucracy. It's starting to become clear that Labor's carbon tax 2.0 will be devastating for regional and rural Queensland families. Life is already tough in the regions. We don't need another tax. Everyone is already tightening their belts. This will just add more pressure, and this is just plain irresponsible.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Meanwhile Labor's policy lets high-emissions electricity users completely off the hook. Some of our big banks, who are large energy users with their data centres, get off scot-free. It's the high-vis industries of mining and manufacturing who are coughing up again, not the suit-wearing industries that create emissions in the cities. But let's face it. We all know we pay more under Labor. We all know life is harder under Labor. Labor's carbon tax will drive up the cost of living at a time when Australian workers and families can least afford it. The businesses that do hang around will pass the additional costs straight on to consumers through higher food prices and higher prices for building materials. Currently the people in my region are dealing with interest rate hikes, rising energy costs, increases in insurance premiums, fuel hikes and cuts in roads and communications infrastructure, and they are now dealing with the fear of job losses. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">A month ago the Prime Minister turned up in Mackay for a one-hour photo opportunity. He didn't take the time to talk to mining or manufacturing companies. He didn't take the time to talk to workers or small-business owners. He certainly didn't take the time to visit our substandard roads and note our lack of infrastructure. His lack of interest in the region is obvious and alarming. I often wonder: where did the Labor Party go? The old Labor Party would never put Greens policies above what was right for the high-vis worker. The old Labor used to stand up for miners and the resource sector. Now they just tax the life out of them. The Labor Party's constituency base used to be the working class, but these days it seems to me that they're in an identity crisis, because it's clear what they stand for and what values they base their policies on, and it's clear that they no longer value the worker. They penalise people who work hard and who want to get ahead without relying on government handouts. It is very clear to the people of Central and North Queensland that the Albanese Labor government are holding the regions back. Australians are always paying more under Labor.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs PHILLIPS</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Gilmore</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:08</span>):  I rise today in support of the Safeguard Mechanism (Crediting) Amendment Bill 2022 because I know this is a crucial step forward in our plan to power Australia and take genuine and effective action to reduce our emissions. As a country, we have been having this conversation for far too long. We have seen a decade of energy policy failures. We have seen a decade of inaction to address our changing climate. We have seen business uncertainty and missed opportunities in the renewable energy space. The list goes on. The Albanese government was elected to change all of this. We were elected to move our country forward finally, to end the climate wars and to finally put a plan in place for energy security, for business certainty and for investment in Australian made, a plan to rewire our nation, create the jobs of the future and drive investment in renewable energy—cleaner, cheaper power for local people and businesses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that industry have been leading the way for years. In a policy vacuum created by government, they have taken charge and made significant changes to how they do business. That's not just because they know it's the right thing to do for our planet; it's because it makes good business sense. That's the key. This is actually critical for thriving and growing businesses, because there are better ways of operating, there are cheaper ways of operating and there is so much opportunity that has been wasted. There are cheaper ways of operating, and there is so much opportunity that has been wasted.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government is working to end that waste. We are working to support businesses who have been going it alone for far too long. We want to support and encourage businesses to unlock emissions reductions where they are most efficient. The main purpose of this bill is to reward industrial facilities that are staying below their baselines, while at the same time giving other facilities new and low-cost ways to reduce their net emissions. The introduction of safeguard crediting and trading will lower the cost of reducing emissions so that we can stay on track to reach net zero by 2050 in a cost-effective way. A key point here is that many of the 215 facilities producing more than 100,000 tonnes of greenhouse gases a year that are included in the safeguard mechanism have already made long-term climate commitments that surpass Australia's climate targets. They know the world is changing and those who don't keep up will be left behind, so we are creating a supportive policy framework for them to help industry meet its commitments, to drive investment in emissions reductions and to create the flexibility businesses need to find the lowest-cost abatement measures.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Businesses that stay below the baseline, which many are already doing, will be able to generate credits that they can trade. This bill will create the mechanism for that crediting and trading, and will deliver 205 million tonnes in abatement between now and 2030, which is equivalent to taking two-thirds of Australia's cars off the road. It is critical we get this in place quickly to help to drive down our emissions now. We simply must encourage business to innovate and thrive in a changing world economy. It is nearly impossible for large-scale transition to happen without adequate support from government and without an incentivising framework from government to make the right changes in the right places. Industry have been looking for this support for years and has been left to find solutions for themselves. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I have talked many times in this place about some businesses in my electorate of Gilmore, on the New South Wales South Coast, who doing just that: finding ways to turn waste into energy, setting up microgrids to power community facilities, investing in solar and other renewables to generate cleaner, cheaper power. Many people are trying to find a way, and they can and will, of course, because local business owners on the South Coast are adaptable and savvy. They know they have to. They know it is beneficial. But they also know it could be easier, it could be cheaper with more support and encouragement from government, so that's what we are doing. We're helping to keep local business competitive in a changing world, helping them to innovate and helping them to grow. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What does all of this translate to? Jobs—Australian jobs—are just another arm in our plan to keep local people in well-paid jobs of the future. We're creating jobs while at the same time bringing down power prices and bringing down the prices of goods and services because producers can find cheaper ways of doing business, so we're helping with the cost of living. It's a positive feedback loop that we are setting in motion to support local people to bring down the cost of living and finally bring Australia into the 21st century. But we aren't focusing on just one policy, one trigger or one incentive to help us to move our economy forward and support local communities to transition to cleaner, cheaper power. We have already put in motion a range of other initiatives to help us do this because we know we need a package, not a single line item, if we are to keep Australia moving forward. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">One policy package I'm particularly excited about is support for electric vehicles. The South Coast is home to Australia's largest electric vehicle charging station at the Silos Estate in Berry. Their superchargers can entirely recharge an electric car in 20 minutes, which means that not only are they doing their bit to encourage electric vehicles but they are also cementing their winery and the South Coast as a premier road trip destination for electric vehicles: good for the environment, good for the economy and good for business. The Albanese government has already delivered on our election commitment to make electric vehicles more affordable. Our electric car discount bill passed the parliament last year, reducing both the upfront and ongoing costs of owning an electric vehicle. Our National Electric Vehicle Strategy is also working to improve the affordability, supply and uptake of electric vehicles, helping more local people benefit from cleaner, cheaper transport.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently I attended the electric vehicle expo at Batemans Bay. It was a thrilling demonstration of everything electric. There were EV test drives and demos, and lots of questions were answered. I got to check out bikes, scooters, lawnmowers—you name it. Our wonderful Southcoast Health and Sustainability Alliance is at it again, supporting local people to find new and exciting ways to reduce their emissions and transition to renewables—just one of the many exciting initiatives that SHASA takes part in. We definitely can make the South Coast the go to for road trips in EVs, rolling out an EV friendly highway right up and down the coast. The drive is there for local business and communities, and the Albanese government is making sure they have the support of government as well. These are exciting times, creating jobs and revolutionising our economy—not by taking away, but by adding, supporting and growing tourism; supporting agriculture; supporting local people.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that we can create over 60,000 clean energy jobs in Australia by 2025, most of which will be in regional areas like the South Coast, with the right investment and support from government with our Powering Australia plan. We are going to need thousands of workers every year to enter the energy sector to build the massive infrastructure projects that we all need to meet our energy grid needs and reduction targets. On the South Coast we are poised and ready for these jobs. We are the perfect location for clean manufacturing, solar farming, battery production and more.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government has launched the Australian Energy Employment Report survey to directly engage with employers to gain a more detailed understanding of our current and future workforce issues. We want to support the development of the jobs and training we will need to support our transition, to help local people take their place in the global race. We know Australia has the know-how. With the right investment we can be a world leader. We've already started with our New Energy Apprenticeships program. This program will create 10,000 new energy apprenticeships to help young people gain the skills they need for the jobs of the future. An eligible full-time Australian apprentice can receive a payment of $2,000 at six, 12, 24 and 36 months and completion; and part-time apprentices can get $1,000. This payment is to help meet the cost-of-living pressures and incentivise trainees to stay in training.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">From 1 July we'll also have a mentor program so that these apprentices can get the ongoing professional development support they need to learn about the industry, build links and cement their place in the industry. I'm a former TAFE teacher who worked with work placements, so I know just how crucial this is not only in helping to further the education and growth of these apprentices but in helping to ensure they stay in the industry. We're building careers, not just jobs. And we're building them at home, in regional areas like the New South Wales South Coast. What could be more exciting?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">But the Albanese government doesn't want to sit on its laurels. We need to be able to identify current and future workplace issues in the energy sector. This is where the national survey of energy sector businesses comes in: listening to industry, working with them directly to prepare for the future so that we can create a secure energy sector, help to manage energy prices and grow and develop local jobs. The Australian Energy Employment Report will guide businesses around the country to improve workforce planning, give them certainty to invest and make sure our policies are correctly placed to build jobs, skills development and training opportunities. I strongly encourage local energy businesses on the South Coast to engage with this survey so that the needs of our region are included.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another exciting chapter in the Albanese government's plan to support emissions reduction, build local jobs and bring down the cost of living is the formal launch of consultation on Australia's first National Battery Strategy. If we mine it here, we should make it here. That is what we want Australia's approach to be. Global demand for existing and next-generation batteries is forecast to increase up to tenfold in the next decade. As we transition to renewable energy, being able to store that energy adequately and efficiently will become more and more critical to energy security. We want Australia to be a key player in the battery industry, and with such an abundance of natural resources we are uniquely placed to make that happen—not only that, but we also have the innovation and research capabilities to make this a reality.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I've said already, we are not relying on one facet to create the jobs of our future. Boosting our national battery manufacturing capability will complement our National Electric Vehicle Strategy. It will support our 10,000 new energy apprentices, establish a Powering Australia industry growth centre to translate research into local jobs and investment. It will help to deliver the community batteries we have promised to communities like Maloneys Beach in my electorate, making communities more resilient and more sustainable and helping with the cost of living. Each of our policies is like one piece in a wider jigsaw puzzle that is working to push Australia forward and end a decade of stagnation. That's why I support this bill today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Just one final comment: I must say how disappointed I am to see the Greens standing in the way of this legislation. I'm a firm believer that we must learn from the mistakes of the past and we must find ways to compromise and find a common way forward. Sadly, the Greens seem to be making the same mistake they made in 2009. That mistake led us down the path of a decade of inaction on climate change, a decade of energy waste, a decade of this country going in exactly the opposite direction to what the Greens say their whole agenda is about, politicking to the detriment of local people in our community. I implore them not to make that mistake again. Don't stand in the way of good policy that will support our transition, that will support and is supported by industry and that will support jobs growth. We can't afford to waste any more time. I commend this bill to the House.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr JOYCE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">New England</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:21</span>):  This gives me, unfortunately, a sober view of how disconnected this parliament has become from the cost-of-living pressures that are now so apparently on so many people—whether they are in Coles with their shopping trolley, whether they are trying to pay their power bills, whether they are trying to pay for their fuel. Underpinning that is a whole range of climate policy issues that are driving it. We have got to move away from the mythology that, somehow, renewables are making power cheaper. It has never been dearer.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We are also seeing, going hand in glove with the sentiment of the Safeguard Mechanism (Crediting) Amendment Bill 2022 and the safeguard mechanism and further taxes on the last remaining industries such as the last two oil refineries in Australia, that we are going further and further towards a position that says the zealotry and religion of this building—which has trouble trying to change a flag!—can somehow change the temperature of the globe. We have to realise that we have to start putting the mother pushing the shopping trolley first. We have to start understanding that the family that can't pay their power bill comes first. We have to understand that the people who are struggling with their petrol and their fuel come first. This form of zealotry just goes to show you the disconnect that says, 'No, what actually comes first in this parliament is our belief that we are somehow going to single-handedly, by legislation, in Australia, with 1.2 per cent of emissions, change the temperature of the globe.' I'll tell you what you're going to do: you're most definitely going to change the temperature of their wallet, and it's going to become a cold and miserable place.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have seen with this safeguard mechanism—we are talking about AUKUS. The government want net zero by 2050, which—surprise, surprise!—is around the time of the culmination of AUKUS. And what does AUKUS need? I presume it's going to need Australian steel. BlueScope will be taxed. The people driving to work will be taxed because there'll be a new tax on fuel. The gas that's required will be taxed for new gas production. The coal that is used for electricity is taxed. We say we must have a strong defence platform—and we must—but to support it, to pay for it, our nation needs to be as strong as possible as quickly as possible across every field. If it's important enough to spend $360 billion plus on submarines, then it's important enough to have a more sober, clinical realisation of where we are in manufacturing and across myriad fields, and understand that, if we come forward and say the way we are going to help these people is by creating a new form of carbon tax, we're working at conflicting purposes. To encourage people to set up in this nation, we must have the cheapest power. We don't have the cheapest wages, and we don't want the cheapest wages. Global commodities place a price on a global mechanism. We used to have a strategic advantage. We used to have the cheapest power and now we don't. Unless we get back there then the mythical belief that we'll somehow have manufacturing jobs pour into Australia, when manufacturing can be done so much more cheaply somewhere else, is just that: it's a myth.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that with the Labor Party it's coming unstuck. I had a ministerial visit last week. I never got a phone call in my office. I wanted one. It wasn't in the paper that the person was coming. This person did the best impersonation of a nuclear submarine I've seen yet. He just popped up and nobody knew he was there. It was Minister Bowen. He surfaced at Uralla—he just popped up. It was terrifying. No-one knew he was turning up. If they had known he was turning up, by gosh, he would have got a welcoming party. The new transparency in government is the Chris Bowen nuclear submarine. You never know; he could turn up in Rockhampton. Be careful—he's very dangerous. He went up there so he could talk to a small group of people who were onside with him. There are a vast group of people who don't want transmission lines across their country and who don't want to be inside wind factories. We'll have more structures of over 260 metres high around the town of Walgett—with about 2,000 people—than the CBD of Sydney. That is an absurdity. Where people get it wrong is when they say, 'Oh, there'll be all these jobs.' They're contractors: they fly in and they fly out.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another thing we realised is that, if you are going to put in a new coalmine, you have to put money in a trust for the decommissioning and rehabilitation of the site—you have to. If you put in any mine, you have to provide for the rehabilitation of the site. You can't get the DA through without it. But, with these wind factories, you don't need to do that. They just stand there, and when they become obsolete—and, by gosh, they do; the first towers were three-megawatt towers and now they're building 7½-megawatt towers—the cost of pulling down a tower is vastly higher than the cost of putting it up. So what do they do with them? They leave them there. They leave them there because—this is the trick—the farmer's responsible for them. They get paid the $30,000 a year per tower because they're responsible for them. Of course they don't have the $750,000 per tower to decommission them. This is going to be a blight on the landscape.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Now we go to the next section of this bill—the safeguard mechanism. They're going to fix the problem by bringing in a new tax on the industries we already have, and there is the solution of the Labor Party. When you bring up other zero emission technology solutions, such as small modular reactors and nuclear power, they say: 'No, we can't have that. We can't have those manufacturing jobs. We can't have that technology.' Hang on, but you support nuclear submarines, and they've got small modular reactors in them with highly enriched uranium. You know something? The uranium they use in those is actually uranium that was going to go into nuclear weapons. That uranium—some of it from decommissioned nuclear weapons—is used in the reactor. It's highly enriched uranium. But that's all right. They can do that, but they can't get their mind around small modular reactors. They say they want to employ thousands of nuclear technicians, who we imagine will predominantly be under the auspices of the Navy. What happens when these people come? Where will they work? Milk bars? Or—I don't know—will they work as farm labourers? If you had small modular reactors and a nuclear industry in South Australia, you'd actually have jobs for them to go to. You'd actually have high-paying manufacturing jobs and the capacity to produce zero emission power. But they won't do it because of the zeitgeist, the religion. Part of that religion, although it's pro zero emissions, is anti nuclear power. The rest of the world, as they always do, leave poor old Australia behind. Rolls-Royce are developing them, Skoda are developing them, Mitsubishi are developing them, General Electric are developing them and Westinghouse are developing them. Scandinavia, England, France, the United States of America, Argentina and Canada are miles ahead, as are China, Russia and even the United Arab Emirates and Czechoslovakia. </span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Minister Bowen, the human nuclear submarine, who pops up silently, never to be known—the man who does the best impression of a rabbit just disappearing down a hole and popping up a hole—laughs. He says the CSIRO has told us we're the only smart ones. All those other countries are so silly. The only clever one, the only child who's walking in step, is Mr Bowen. All the rest are out of step. We should ring up Rolls-Royce, Skoda and Hitachi and say, 'Stop this. We've heard Mr Bowen. It doesn't work.'</span>

                    </a>  The member for McMahon—I'm not quite sure what his job is at times. This is the issue. The safeguard mechanism is just an anachronistic approach that somehow you create something by taxing it. The whole purpose of taxing something is it becomes a disincentive. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Then we've got the next thing, the credit offsets. Where does this go? Obviously if you're getting credit offsets you're going to farmland, you're going to other areas and you're going to turn them into carbon sinks. I don't know how that works unless we're going to evolve to a higher form of termite. As we move farmland to basically carbon sinks, how does the land operate? How do we get a return off it? What do we do with that? You haven't got cattle, you haven't got sheep and you haven't got farming; you've got trees—trees you can't cut down; you have to stare at them. That apparently gives a sense of moral righteousness; there they are. Somehow in this absurd equation you've got to say, 'That works, but what happens if there's a bushfire and the forest burns down. Do we have to buy more offsets?' How does this crazy equation work?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor Party prefer all the nuances, complexities and craziness of this safeguard mechanism over trying, alternatively, to say, 'Hang on, if we're building nuclear submarines and we actually believe small modular reactors work in nuclear submarines'—imagine when these nuclear submarines come into port. What happens if they turn on a light and light up the port? That's nuclear power. We're going to rush off to the nuclear submarine and say, 'You must now turn off all your lights, because we don't want nuclear power in Australia. You can park your sub here, but you can't have any lights on at the dock. Don't run an extension cord off there or anything like that, because we don't allow nuclear power in Australia, although we have a nuclear submarine with highly enriched uranium in the port.' If you can explain that one to me, Deputy Speaker Buchholz, you're a better man than I am.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I would humbly suggest if you're going to have nuclear submarines then you start by trying to catch up with the rest of the world on the development of small modular reactors so you can actually have a nuclear industry that employees Australians and pays them large amounts of money. I'll make a prediction to you. Since the rest of the world—as I said, Hitachi, Skoda, Rolls-Royce, Westinghouse, General Electric, myriad Chinese companies, New Scale, Ontario power companies—are all developing small modular reactors and now even developing microreactors, which are about the size of two coffee tables, smaller than this table in front of us, I reckon in about 2050 they're going to be around. You're going to see them on Pacific islands. They're going to be everywhere.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Somebody will have made them, and that somebody, because it's up to 20 megawatts—that's 20,000 people, just so you know, as a rough calibration—is going to make a bucketload of money out of making them. But you know where they're going to be? The person who makes the money out of them is going to be in the United States of America, England, France, China, Russia, Canada, Argentina and Scandinavia. But they're not going to be in Adelaide, because we were changing the temperature of the globe singlehandedly with a safeguard mechanism. That's how we're going to do it: the safeguard mechanism—a new tax. In closing. I say: be very careful of a parliament that takes days, possibly a week, to change a flag on top of it, believing it has the capacity to change the temperature of the globe by a new tax.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canberra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:35</span>):  It gives me great pleasure to stand today in support of this very important bill, the Safeguard Mechanism (Crediting) Amendment Bill 2022, a bill that is a critical step on our path towards net zero and a critical part of ending a decade of inaction on emissions reductions. It is a bill that will ensure that we get to 43 per cent emissions by 2030 and net zero by 2050, a bill which will finally get Australia back at the global table and with the respect of our international neighbours, and a bill that is an integral part of the very important work of decarbonising our economy and transforming Australia into a renewable energy superpower.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As on so many important issues, for three years I sat in this chamber in the last term in absolute despair as the former government stood in the way of action on the climate crisis. I listened to speeches denying the science, and the previous contribution from the member for New England was just another example of that; it continues. They have learnt nothing. They are not following the science. In fact, he actually referred to climate action as a 'religion' in his previous speech, and this is the sort of nonsense that the Australian people were subjected to by their former government for a decade. In parts of the country where there are concerns about the impacts of climate action, a big part of the blame for that is on the former government for this misleading, for the culture wars and for the absolute rubbish that we heard for a decade. I am very pleased now to be speaking in support of a bill that is going to put in place the important changes we need to get going along that path. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the previous term we watched as the coalition tore itself apart over just committing to net zero. When they finally did adopt it, they had no plan on getting there and were basically treated as an international pariah at COP26 in Glasgow. Quite simply, no-one believed a word that the former Prime Minister said. He said at COP that his government was acting on climate in 'the Australian way', which I think brings 'the Australian way' into disrepute, because Australians are people who take action and get on with things, and what they were doing on climate action was absolutely nothing. He pledged to meet net zero by 2050 with no plan—just a pamphlet and an Abbott-era interim target.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While the world considered putting carbon tariffs on this country for Mr Morrison's inaction, the Australian people also passed their judgement and they voted for climate action at the election last year. They demanded real climate action and they voted for change, and that's what we're getting today. I know that my community in Canberra is an incredibly engaged and active community when it comes to climate action, and I know that it wants nothing less than the ambitious action we need because we are, in fact, in a climate crisis.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year, the world saw the largest single investment in climate action ever, and that was when President Biden signed into law the Inflation Reduction Act. The equation changed, and it changed dramatically. This new law directed close to US$400 billion in US government funding into the clean energy revolution. Whether it be subsidies for renewables, green transportation or transmission lines, this is a huge paradigm shift. As the Prime Minister has said in question time, this bill will have a huge impact around the world. It was, in essence, the starting gun for a hugely competitive race to become a renewable energy superpower.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Inflation Reduction Act creates huge incentives for capital investment in manufacturing and other industries to be directed into the United States. That's why it's incredibly important that the Australian parliament passes this important legislation before us so that our nation is not left behind and, as Labor has been talking about for so long, so that we build on our natural advantages and become that renewable energy superpower. We are blessed with significant renewable energy resources, and, if we can harness this opportunity and export it to the world, this becomes our jobs opportunity. This government knows that, Australian businesses know that and the Australian people know that and told us very clearly on 22 May last year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government also understands the huge challenges that come with decarbonising our economy. Increasing the share of renewables in our grid to 82 per cent by 2030 won't be easy. It requires a lot of investment and a lot of work to turn this ship around, and we don't have a whole lot of time remaining. Strong action this decade is critical to addressing climate change. I know that the people of my electorate expect nothing less than the ambitious action that we need, and I want you to understand that the action we are taking is incredibly ambitious. It will be a huge task to meet the targets we have set. The year 2030 is only 80 months away—80 months to fully transform how this country gets its energy. It's ambitious. It's important. It will be hard, but it will be done, and this bill is a key part of that work. The government wants this reform to commence on 1 July this year, and any delay will only make that task harder.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to congratulate the Minister for Climate Change and Energy on his hard work in bringing this bill before the parliament and informing Australians about the work the Albanese government is doing to take climate action. I'd like to congratulate him on his ambition, his openness and the consultative approach he has taken with all people with an interest in climate action, and also on his belief in science as central to this, which is something incredibly refreshing following the last 10 years under the previous government.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I was very proud that one of the first speeches I gave as a member of the government in this 47th Parliament was in support of the Climate Change Act that was passed by this parliament in September. Passing that legislation laid a critical foundation for climate action. An advanced safeguard mechanism is a crucial building block for Australia's long-overdue transition to net zero, a transition that was delayed and denied by the climate Luddites in the coalition for nearly a decade and a transition that is still opposed by many in the opposition—and again I point to the previous contribution, from the member for New England.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese Labor government are now fixing this mess, and this bill today is another important milestone on our journey to net zero, because there is no point in a target without action, and we developed our target after modelling what we could achieve. We have always said this is a floor, not a ceiling, and we want to deliver the best and fastest reduction that we can. Reducing emissions is the action that is desperately needed. We know Australia is one of the world's biggest emitters per capita, but we have natural advantages, and we could be among the lowest.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill will reduce emissions by reforming the safeguard mechanism and allowing us to meet our legislated targets. It will require Australia's largest industrial facilities to reduce their emissions gradually and predictably, cutting their baselines by 4.9 per cent each year between 2024 and 2030, in line with our national targets. Australian businesses have seen the future, and many have made strong emissions reduction commitments. We don't want our country to be left behind as the world moves on, following the science. The safeguard mechanism covers around 215 large industrial facilities—those that produce more than 100,000 tons of greenhouse gases a year and account for around 28 per cent of Australia's emissions. About 80 per cent of the safeguard facilities are already covered by corporate net-zero commitments, representing around 86 per cent of scheme emissions. These reforms help them to work towards these targets. The national targets, which I've already mentioned, are to cut emissions to 43 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030 and to net zero emissions by 2050. These are ambitious targets. The safeguard reforms are expected to save 205 million tonnes of emissions in the period to 2030. To put that in perspective, 205 million tonnes is equivalent to taking two-thirds of Australian cars off the road in the same period.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">To the people of my electorate: I have had many meetings with people about this safeguard mechanism, and I have met with many national stakeholders as well, and I understand the genuine passion that you have for this and the genuine concern that you have that we must take the most ambitious action we can. I just want to put that in perspective. This is a huge change that we are embarking on and that our government is leading. If there is any question about the ambition, in the short time that we have been in government we have made climate change action a huge focus. There is an incredible list of things we have already put in place. I don't want to turn my speech into a list speech, because it would take it all up, but we are really doing our absolute best towards taking the action that we need and making Australia the renewable energy superpower that we can be.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As I say, the targets will not be easy to meet, and it will take deliberate and sustained effort. Our Powering Australia plan will build on the existing safeguard mechanism so that we can make the required cuts. The safeguard mechanism provides an established, legislated framework that will place emissions limits called baselines on large industrial facilities. These facilities are the country's largest emitters outside the electricity sector and contribute about 28 per cent of total emissions. Facilities that beat their baselines will be issued with tradable credits, and these credits will provide an incentive for all facilities to reduce their emissions if they have cost-effective opportunities, helping to deliver Australia's climate targets at lowest cost. This system gives an incentive for all those covered facilities to reduce their emissions and access lowest-cost abatement. These reforms to the safeguard mechanism are supported by business because they will provide certainty into the future and the confidence that industry needs to take action. As I said, it's only 80 months until 2030, and any delay will make it harder to meet our 2030 targets. Delay will create uncertainty for investors and require business to do more in a shorter time to achieve targets.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's also important to note the support for this bill from industry, because we need to build collaboration. For too long climate action has been undermined by those seeking to create division for their own political advantage. Labor has sought to build support through consultation. We have consulted widely on these reforms, including in industrial roundtables, and have received more than 280 submissions on the design. The Chubb review also concluded that Australia's carbon-crediting scheme arrangements are sound and identified a number of opportunities for improvement. The government has accepted in principle all recommendations and is now working with stakeholders to implement them.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We took our policies and plans to the election and won a strong mandate from the Australian people to take strong climate action. As I've said, the people of Canberra accept nothing less, because they accept the science and they have seen the climate crisis as the lived reality that it is, particularly in the Black Summer bushfires of 2019-20, when our city, which usually has some of the most beautiful air in the world, had the worst and most hazardous air quality in the world for around a month, in about January. We actually went into a form of lockdown. People were wearing masks in the street; this was before we knew about that from the pandemic. Our airport was closed. A lot of our shops and businesses were closed. People with health conditions were told to stay indoors and have air conditioning on or to relocate, which obviously for many people was not an option. So in Canberra we have already experienced the very real impacts of climate change, as, of course, have those in our region who lost homes and businesses and lives in those bushfires. The incredible ecological scale of that will stay with Canberrans forever. I know that it stays with me as a local member who was relatively new at that time. The sentiment from my community will always stay with me.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In the past week, in the non-sitting week, I have had many meetings with constituents who raised concerns about this safeguard mechanism. They want to it be the strongest that it can be. Again, I just want to say that our government is a government led by science. We absolutely are. We are a government that wants to get this done as quickly as possible. We have a minister who has engaged across the board with the environment movement and with business and industry, because it is important to have their support. The climate emergency is Australia's jobs opportunity. That is a positive thing. Perhaps it wasn't emphasised enough in the past. There is still concern around the country about the impacts of climate action. Why wouldn't there be, when a government, for over a decade, told people that this was a bad thing when it was an absolutely urgent thing?</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I am so proud that, after three years of calling out for climate action from opposition benches in the last term, we have a government that is taking it, and taking it with the urgency and ambition it deserves. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fisher</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:50</span>):  I often start my speeches in this place with a brief reflection on the coalition's track record whilst we were in government. I do this not because I want to reminisce about the glory days of when I was sitting in that chair, for example; I do it because I want to remind members, and those watching, that the coalition delivered. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition did take action on climate change. We support real action. We didn't just speak about it. We got on with the job. We're not just an opposition shouting out, making promises or arguing for argument's sake. We had a plan; we delivered on that plan. The safeguard mechanism was our policy. It was a core part of the plan to drive down emissions while backing innovative technologies. We will support the government in delivering a balanced approach to reducing emissions, addressing pollution and ensuring Australia remains a strong, prosperous and independent nation. But, unfortunately, the Safeguard Mechanism (Crediting) Amendment Bill 2022 does no such thing. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Our balanced plan delivered real action on climate change because we are the party of direct environmental action. We are the party of the National Heritage Trust. We are the party of water security, landcare and clean energy technologies. Those opposite so often shout, interject and browbeat about the coalition's environmental record, but the facts speak for themselves. After nine years in office, we had grown our economy by 23 per cent in the face of natural disasters, COVID-19 and an economic crisis. At the same time, we left office on track to exceed our 2030 Paris target, headed for a reduction in emissions between 30 and 35 per cent. That was better than Canada, it was better than Japan, it was better than New Zealand and it was better than the United States. Australia led the way on the 2020 Kyoto targets, beating them by more than 459 million tonnes. We reduced 20 per cent of emissions on our 2005 base level, and we were headed towards net zero by 2050. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In our last five years alone in government, we invested $40 billion into renewable energy. Renewables now make up one-third of Australia's energy generation. This led to the creation of as many as 160,000 jobs. We supported over 6,900 clean energy projects in Queensland through the Clean Energy Finance Corporation. In 2021 we installed 6.1 gigawatts of renewable capacity, more than in the entire term of the previous Labor government. Let me say that again in case those opposite missed it: in 2021 we installed 6.1 gigawatts of renewable capacity, more than in the entire term of the previous Labor government. Nearly one in three homes, of course, have photovoltaic cells on their roof: the world's highest rate of solar rooftop panels. While Labor denigrated our farmers and our miners, we actually delivered on renewable energy. We invested $250 million into recycling modernisation and $3 billion into the Great Barrier Reef protection. We introduced the Threatened Species Strategy. We positioned Australia to be a true leader in Antarctic stewardship, science and security. We rolled out $52 million in the Digital Environmental Assessments Program. We invested $590 million in biosecurity measures and $200 million in the Environmental Restoration Fund. We balanced historic economic growth with record emissions reduction and environmental action. You really can have the best of both worlds, and we did it without taxes. Our agenda was, simply put, technology, not taxes; progress, not platitudes. We wanted measurable progress on emissions reduction without giving families and their businesses the bill. We got on with the job and we delivered, because that is what good governments do. They set a target and they achieve it. This was our approach.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese Labor government have not taken this approach. They have taken a very, very different approach, but it's an approach that Labor have trod before. They've chosen to reject a balanced approach, and Australian families and their businesses are now paying the price. Labor proposed to price carbon dioxide at $75 a tonne. Australia will have a price that is three times as high as the one set by the previous Labor government, and it is set to rise to $100 by 2030.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's not be mistaken about this. This is a carbon tax in the garb of a safeguard mechanism. It's just another attempt to dismantle good coalition policy. After a decade of emissions reduction being balanced with economic growth, Labor is now rushing to impose drastic cuts on Australian businesses. The safeguard mechanism has been working well for years as a system to cap emissions whilst the economy has grown. But Labor cannot help themselves. They're now changing the purpose of the scheme from one that stops emissions by encouraging businesses and backing technology to a scheme that punishes businesses and imposes more and more taxes. It's as if they want to make Australian businesses uncompetitive. It's as if they want Australian businesses to become unviable.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This Labor government had the audacity to claim that industry supports this policy. This same federal Labor government claimed that industry supported its reckless and unprecedented industrial relations reforms because they attended the jobs summit it slapped together in 2022. Do you remember that—the jobs summit? You don't hear them talk about that much anymore, do you? The fact is that many, if not all, of the industries covered by the safeguard mechanism have strong concerns about many aspects of this Labor government's policy. Key Australian industries are incredibly worried. Think about critical mineral resources like copper, coal, gas and iron ore. We are world leaders in clean minerals processing. I know you know this, Mr Deputy Speaker Buchholz. Yet Labor want to dissuade investors and send them elsewhere. Most of our competitors do not have any national carbon pricing scheme in place at all. Just think about that. What cruel government would squander Australia's natural competitive advantage by taxing hardworking Australians and their employers? What strange, self-sabotaging government would surrender one of Australia's core economic strengths and discourage global investment? I'll give you a hint. It's those members on that side.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Producers of cement, steel and aluminium—large employers—once again have been ignored by Labor. Labor's ignorance, incompetence and indifference in pursuit of this policy will drive up the cost of construction and manufacturing. On the Sunshine Coast, construction accounts for 18,123 jobs. It's about 12½ per cent of the local workforce. As I said, it has a value-add of around $1.9 billion to our local economy. Manufacturing accounts for 8,024 jobs, or 5.5 per cent of the labour force. It has a value-add of around $890 million to our economy. These are crucial sectors for employment and economic growth on the Sunshine Coast. Labor's failure to address the cost-of-living crisis, as well as its obsession with red tape and wacky climate policies, is going to cost many in my community their livelihoods. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Think, Mr Deputy Speaker, about rail and transport. Think about the logistics. Think about utilities and infrastructure development. Think about agriculture, forestry, fishing, retail, health care and technology. It's all of these industries that are going to suffer. It's not just the mining and energy sectors at risk from Labor's poorly packaged green tape that we're debating here today. Labor's sneaky carbon tax will affect almost every industry, every household and every Australian. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Perhaps most egregiously, they've put this policy on the table without any modelling. I know if people are listening to this they're thinking, 'No, surely they haven't introduced this policy without any modelling to see what sort of damage this is going to cause to the economy.' Those opposite make bold and untested promises to gain power, and then they present half-baked policy experiments to the Australian people, hoping that feel-good photo ops distract them. Recently, in Senate estimates, it was confirmed that the government has not undertaken any assessments of impacts of this policy. The government has not analysed how some of these severe emissions reduction targets—the most severe in the world—will deliver Labor's aspirations of a 30 per cent reduction by 2030. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Labor did not model the economic impacts of its policy on investment, on jobs and on household budgets. Let's not be mistaken. It will be Australian households who will pay the price, and that is happening now. In question time, the Minister for Climate Change and Energy was trying to argue that, because those opposite, the government, put in place caps last year, Australians should be jumping for joy—that we've never had it so good because instead of an increase of 50 per cent they're only paying an additional 30 per cent. Well, you try telling that to the average punter at home. I think the average punter at home will have a very different view about what's good for them from what this government says is good for them. As I said, it will be Australian households who pay the price.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">There's no modelling of the expanding credit market the government wants to use and no assessment of demand for carbon credits or their price. We do know that if demand for carbon credits exceeds supply then businesses will be lumped with a penalty of $275 per tonne of CO2. They promised 97 times that power bills would be cut by $275. Now, without warning, they're imposing a $275-per-tonne tax onto Australian businesses. In this last-minute climate policy, we have a litany of unanswered questions. Will businesses pay that $275 per tonne? Will they just suck it up and say, 'Oh, you know, we won't worry about that; we'll take that off the bottom line'? I don't think that's going to happen. We all know that businesses are going to pass that down the line. It will be consumers that pay the price, and ultimately it will be businesses that pay the price, because this policy, make no mistake, will result in businesses having to close their doors because they cannot compete on a world stage. Those members opposite should reflect on that—that this policy, which has not been modelled, will close businesses and people will lose their jobs.</span>

They deserve to know what impact this will have on the availability, reliability and affordability of their electricity. Labor have not provided an assessment of how many new safeguard mechanism credits could be created under this legislation. They have not told us how they'll support trade exposed industries. Businesses should know whether they can afford to keep their lights on. Instead, Labor is keeping the Australian people in the dark. </span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Corangamite</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:05</span>):  Reforming the safeguard mechanism will ensure Australia's largest emitters play their part in meeting our national targets, ultimately reducing emissions by 43 per cent by 2030 and achieving net zero by 2050. I know the importance of this because every day I receive emails and phone calls from my local community in Torquay, in Ocean Grove, in Waurn Ponds, in Bannockburn demanding stronger climate action, and every day my region sees the impacts of climate change. We face coastal erosion that is causing damage to beaches and infrastructure from the Bellarine to the Surf Coast. We face the prospect of more flooding, like we saw this summer in Inverleigh, Mount Duneed and Drysdale; we face the prospect of more bushfires and more extreme weather events; and we see the increasing stress on already endangered flora and fauna and on rivers like the Barwon and the Moorabool. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This is why the Albanese government has taken action with the Safeguard Mechanism (Crediting) Amendment Bill, and, it should be noted, there has been wide consultation with the Australian business community, which is behind us. The framework set out in the bill will limit emissions from large industrial facilities and encourage them to reduce their emissions and disincentivise non-sustainable new facilities from being opened. The mechanism will apply to facilities that emit more than 100,000 tonnes of CO2 emissions each year. One of the key proposals is the allocation of a proportional share of the national emissions reduction target to the top emitters. This will ensure they reduce their net emissions at the same rate as the rest of the economy between now and 2030 to meet the 43 per cent emissions reduction target. This will require aggregate safeguard emissions to fall from an estimated 143 million tonnes this financial year to no more than 100 million tonnes in 2030. All up, these emitters are estimated to deliver around 205 million tonnes of abatement by 2030. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Another component of this bill is to retain the existing reduction adjusted intensity baseline framework, ensuring safeguard baselines grow and fall with production. This approach has been strongly supported, as I said earlier, by the business sector and demonstrates that this new framework will not penalise growth. Rather, jobs will flow from this policy and from climate change policies. The government proposes a hybrid approach where baselines start close to facility site-specific values and transitions to industry average benchmarks by 2030. The hybrid approach will deliver the same emissions reduction, ensuring safeguard facilities contribute their share of the national emissions target. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government also proposes to set baselines for new facilities at international best practice, adapted for the Australian context. This recognises that new facilities will have the opportunity to use the latest technology to build best-practice emissions performance into their design. With that, I hope the National Reconstruction Fund can endeavour to push our local regional industries to take up these opportunities, and I will be making sure those in my region have that opportunity. We want to reduce competitive distortion between new and existing facilities, and international practice will also apply at existing facilities if they begin producing new products. Additionally, flexible compliance arrangements will be available from day one. These arrangements reduce compliance costs without any change to the overall environmental outcome. Safeguard mechanism credits will be automatically issued to facilities with emissions below their baseline. Facilities can sell these credits to other facilities, surrender them to meet compliance obligations or bank them for future use. The government proposes facilities be allowed to bank credits until 2030, to give facilities flexibility around the timing of their abatement activities. This will help reduce costs. The bill also allows for facilities to borrow up to 10 per cent of their baseline for the following year to provide further flexibility.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Access to domestic offsets for compliance will continue unchanged. This will allow facilities to access cost-effective abatement outside the scheme—for example, in agriculture or land management. Further, the government has accepted in principle all recommendations of the Chubb review and will work with stakeholders to implement these changes. Extended multiyear monitoring periods will be made available on a facility-by-facility basis to give businesses flexibility while they invest in new technologies that reduce their emissions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This government wants to work with industry and with business, but we want the outcomes. Together we can get there, but we need to work together to ensure that we support industry—that it's not affected—but that we reduce our emissions to zero by 2050. While many safeguard facilities support their use in the future, they understand the rules for international units relating to credits under the Paris Agreement are not yet settled. The government may consider including international offsets in the future, so long as they are of high integrity and contribute to Australia's Paris Agreement commitments.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Given the urgent and unprecedented challenges we face, it is absolutely essential that the government's proposed reforms commence from 1 July this year. The need for these reforms is both ambitious and necessary, and it is critical that we act now. The risks of delaying progress on climate action are simply too great, and the consequences of inaction will be felt for generations to come. On that, I know my community would not be the same without the incredible natural environment around us. It sustains the jobs in our region. It brings people to our region to work, to visit and to live.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The former government failed in its duty to protect the environment, for too long. In doing so, it failed to look after our communities. We called on the former government to introduce strong national environmental standards. We called on them to establish a genuinely independent cop on the beat for the Australian environment and to fix the environmental failures caused by their massive funding cuts. The EPBC Act is one of those policies we aim to change. All our calls have fallen on deaf ears. It's no surprise, then, that those opposite in the coalition have been critical of this bill—a bill that was represented by the member for Hume himself. Although the former government's plan was far from perfect, baselines were set above emissions and facilities were given permission to increase their baseline to boost their emissions. The result? Industrial emissions increased over time. We will not make the same mistake. We will prioritise results, not political points, with this bill. Why? We simply cannot afford to delay action any longer. The climate challenge demands a response equal to its scale and urgency.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The proposed design of the safeguard mechanism amendment, guided by the principle of effectiveness, equity, efficiency and simplicity, strikes an appropriate balance between a range of stakeholder views. It will provide a clear framework for businesses to operate—one that is sustainable, responsible and forward thinking. It is not a threat to economic growth or job creation but, rather, a vital tool for driving and supporting the transition to a net zero future—one that we all want. Australian businesses recognise this. They recognise the importance of having a clear policy framework to drive and support the transition to net zero—one that will help them remain competitive in a world that is rapidly decarbonising. These reforms ensure accountability that will see businesses keep previously made commitments. The vast majority of businesses are already committed to reducing their emissions and transitioning to a net zero future. Our reforms will simply ensure that all are held to the same standard, creating a level playing field that rewards innovation and investment in clean energy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The proposed amendments to the safeguard mechanism have received support from stakeholders across all sectors including industry, business and environmental groups. The Business Council of Australia, the Australian Industry Group and the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry have all welcomed the reforms. They recognise that this amendment will help advance jobs and that this bill is a necessary step on the path to a more sustainable and prosperous future for our nation. They recognise that we need to take action on this real climate challenge, and they know that this amendment is a vital part of that effort.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">By taking decisive action now, we will provide our economy with the confidence and certainty to plan and prepare for the future—a future where our economy thrives and our position as a global leader in sustainability flourishes. For this reason, the Albanese government is serious about meeting our 2030 targets. Therefore we must also acknowledge that we cannot achieve our emissions reduction targets alone; we must collaborate with our partners abroad to address the global climate crisis. The proposed reforms will help to limit our exposure to carbon border adjustment mechanisms that many countries are implementing and ensure that we remain competitive in a rapidly changing global economy. Let us take this opportunity to demonstrate our leadership, our commitment and our determination to rise to the challenges of our time for the sake of our beaches, our native animals, our world heritage sites, our coastline and the ancient sacred sites of our First Nations people, for the benefit of everybody who wants to see a future where there are not the disasters and the impacts that we currently see. It is time for us to take action and lead the way towards a more sustainable future.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd like to thank my local environmental groups who have advocated for positive action on climate change. Some, like Australian Parents for Climate Action, have their concerns. They've come to see me; I'm catching up with them next week. I want to assure this group—and all those groups that feel passionately about climate change and reducing our emissions rapidly—that this government is listening. We're absolutely committed to 43 per cent emissions reduction by 2030 and net zero emissions by 2050. Credits will enable the 250 industry emitters to have a direct pathway to helping us achieve our goal of zero emissions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I urge all in this House to support this bill. Let us not let the perfect get in the way of the good. We must end the climate wars and give Australians hope for a future where we can reach zero emissions and create thousands of new clean energy jobs. I commend this bill to the House.</span>

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Monash</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:18</span>):  I feel I've passed this way before many times—many speeches. If you listen to the member for Jagajaga today, you'd say that the Safeguard Mechanism (Crediting) Amendment Bill 2022 is the greatest thing since sliced bread. If you listen to the member for Corio, you get the same message, but there were some underlying messages that came through to me as I listened to a number of the speeches today. And, while the member for Corio is still here, I thought her speech was very effective on behalf of her electorate, but then she said, 'We've got to support businesses so they're not affected.' Hang on! All of the press releases and all the information says that all of these businesses are going to be affected. It's just about how much they're affected.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My concern with the legislation is that we don't know how much they're going to be affected. We haven't got any idea. Nothing I've read in all the information tells me exactly what it's going to cost. Now, I know governments can't get everything right, Treasury doesn't get everything right and the climate group don't get everything right, but shouldn't there be some reasonable guide where I can tell my community what it's going to cost? There are 215 of these big organisations across Australia, and of course this will capture more as time goes on, because as a business grows, they come under this target. It says here in Chris Bowen's own press release—to the ABC, of course—you can't reduce production to reduce your emissions, otherwise people would have an incentive not to grow their business. He said, 'No, you can't do that; we won't count that. We're going to do a separate assessment of every organisation and then tell you what your 4.9 per cent target is.' Who's going to make the assessment, for heaven's sake? I'm simple; I come out of business. I just want to know what you're putting forward, and what it's saying here is we want to give business the heads-up on where we're headed as a nation. But this 'Federal government to lower emissions ceiling on biggest polluters by 4.9 per cent each year' is supported by all these people. It doesn't say how; it just says this is what we're going to do.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As you know, this type of legislation was introduced by a previous government, and in that previous government I saw people on the other side heavily criticising the legislation at the time. In fact there wasn't one speaker from the Labor side supporting the legislation that was brought forward then—not one. So we've done a complete reversal where they're totally supporting the same type of program, but instead of making it voluntary, where businesses could do their very best to reduce those emissions—we were getting there; there's proof in the pudding—now they're saying, 'We're making it mandatory because we're the government that makes things mandatory. If business doesn't do what it's told, we'll make it mandatory and we'll get all these senior business leaders to bow down before us'—</span>

                    </a>  'and bend the knee to our program, what we've decided to do.' That's exactly what's going on here. At the end of the member for Corio's speech, which was a good speech, on the topic—she got the talking points right—she also said, 'Hey, this goes down really well with my local environment groups, all about my coastline, my rivers and the things that are happening.' Do you think this legislation will make one ounce of difference to the erosion that is happening around all of our Victorian beaches at the moment in a 200-year cycle we've been expecting for ages? Only very strong man-made groynes, rock walls and other processes can stop that. We've actually built on land in this nation that 200 years ago was ocean and sand dunes. There are shells in my backyard at Phillip Island because that's where the sea once was.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We're saying these bushfires are being caused by climate change. How dare I even suggest they're not all caused by climate change. Could they be caused by bad management of our forests for 200 years and more recently, in the last 50 years? We saw that in the last bushfires that went through New South Wales and Victoria. Did they have a problem with their townships where there'd been Indigenous management of the forests? No, they didn't. But step outside the Indigenous management and the places were torn to shreds by fires, because of our management of our environment. I take the blame.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In this legislation I would back you 100 per cent if I hadn't heard it all before and believed that the legislation was actually going to do what it is suggested it will do. What it will do is put up the price of steel, put up the price of cement and put up the price of products that come from those steel and cement products. Some of our biggest companies are going to have to cover higher costs because of this legislation—that's acknowledged by the government. But do they acknowledge how much harder it will make it for a first home buyer to be able to get into a home, or that a backyard shed will increase in price? I'm not saying it'll become unaffordable, but a backyard shed is going to cost you a whole lot more. Your little shed in the backyard is going to cost you a whole lot more because of this legislation. Do you know that all your main buildings will cost a whole lot more because of this legislation? Do you know that these companies will have diminished output because of this legislation? And do you know that, in China, their emissions are rising because they're building power station after power station after power station after power station? Of course their emissions are going up because they've got greater product going out. And yet this bill says, if you increase your business and you have greater emissions, it is only natural that as our economy grows our emissions are going to grow. So how do we deal with that in this legislation? I thought the proposition before the nation prior to that was a much better proposition than this is because of all the unknowns that are in this legislation. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government talks about a soft hit on the economy. What's a soft hit on the economy and what's a hard hit on the economy? 'This is going to be just a soft hit on our own economy.' Is that the same type of soft hit that has been wrought upon white paper manufacturing in this country? The courts have decided they know better than governments in our regional forest agreements and other agreements we have regarding the management of our native forests, where right now in Victoria 400 forestry workers in one area or another are being paid to do nothing. Every week 400 of them are being paid to do nothing because our whole forest industry is caught and stuck in the courts, and the state government of Victoria is doing nothing about it. They have the power and the authority to end this tomorrow. The same ideology is driving this legislation as is driving what's happening in Victoria. And you say: 'Oh, it doesn't count. We're saving our forests.' Unless you are going to make pallets out of recycled plastic to take the steel that members in this House produce in their electorates, you actually need hardwood pallets for those exchanges of heavy freight. You can't use pine; it's not strong enough. Two years ago it was identified that, unless there were more hardwood products being sawn through the sawmills and put into pallets, we were going to run out of pallets. If you run out of pallets, you stop moving freight around this country or around the world. </span>

I'm going to exit the chair on a duty roster, but before I leave, a point was made earlier on and it's a correct point.

                    </a>  Thank you for correcting me. The member for Corio is equally guilty actually, but thanks for drawing it to my attention. I won't make that mistake again; I have very high regard for the member for Corangamite. Having said that and having been corrected, I haven't been corrected on the fact that there are 200 people totally supported by their union, the CFMMEU forestry division, begging the Victorian government to do something about this issue so that we have the pallets needed for our exports and all the internal freight moving round Australia—no pallets; no freight.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">All of these things have consequences. This legislation has consequences. All this side has asked the government of the day is: what are the consequences? 'We have a 43 per cent reduction in emissions by 2030, which is in seven years time, and it's going to affect all of these 215 businesses—end of story.' Can you explain what the cost will be for us to get to that by 2030? 'No, but we'll have a 43 per cent reduction.' To the detriment of whom? Who's going to lose their jobs? What businesses won't to be able to operate under this process? Is it a crime in this day and age to ask reasonable questions of the government of the day about the policies they've put in place? There is nothing I've read here, or in the excellent talking points I was given by the coalition, on what the cost is going to be. Nobody knows. It could be anything.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Are we going to risk our most important industries? I heard the members of parliament on this side of the House—on the coalition side, the opposition side—talk about how it's going to affect individual companies in their electorate. Those companies are probably not part of the big business spruikers. They're just businesses trying to get along in a very difficult world. I recognise that. We recognise there are changes in the climate. I've been seeing changes in the climate since 1990 when I came into this place and recognised there were differences and there were practical things we could do. I've seen every government struggle with it. But to come in and implement it this way will, I believe, be a detriment to the nation.</span>

                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I also haven't seen one of these programs, in all my years in the House and out of the House, come to fruition with the promises and dreams that were made in the process of implementing the legislation. I've never seen one. I've never seen one state government meet its targets for emissions reduction—not one. I've heard a lot of promises, usually just before elections—a lot of promises and a lot of guarantees. My state government—the Andrews government—is actually introducing the State Electricity Commission of Victoria back again, with renewables. Because I'm out of time: every time I've seen an announcement on renewables, the price of power goes up.</span>

                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr NEUMANN</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Blair</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:33</span>):  I am pleased to speak on the Safeguard Mechanism (Crediting) Amendment Bill 2022. For too long too much time has been devoted in this country and in this place to fighting the climate wars. It's been on full display today by those opposite. The political infighting has seen Australia not just stand still but go backwards in taking action on climate change, and we've missed the economic and job opportunities that come from real action on climate change.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">When I was first elected in 2007 I wanted to take action on climate change, like so many of those people who were my friends who got elected in 2007. We well remember in December 2009 the Greens torpedoing the Rudd government's Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme and the mindless negativity and relentless attack on the Gillard government carbon price from Tony Abbott. As prime minister, he changed it and got rid of it, and as opposition leader he relentlessly attacked it. In the coalition's subsequent lost decade, they tore themselves apart on policy after policy—22 failed energy policies. The National Energy Guarantee couldn't even last 24 hours. It didn't even last from question time to the time the then Prime Minister, Malcolm Turnbull, talked about it in his caucus room. Our nation has seen prime ministers and leaders come and go over these issues. We've heard leading experts like Professor Ross Garnaut, along with eminent public servants like Ken Henry and Martin Parkinson, lament the climate denialism and the missed opportunities. Australia's progress on climate change didn't just lie stagnant under the coalition; it went backwards. Under the coalition not only was there a lack of domestic investment; everything was undermined, including our international reputation.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Today we've seen the coalition's failure on full display. We've had chunks of the National Party over there still lurking back and lamenting that Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen is not the Premier of my state of Queensland. They are in complete denial on climate change. We've heard speaker after speaker from the National Party from my home state of Queensland. But there have been Liberals here—I call them Liberals; they're really conservatives—who think that, if climate change is real, we should do nothing; we shouldn't pass this legislation. 'If we do something, we shouldn't pass this bill,' is the other argument they run, and 'If we do this, it won't make any difference at all.' On the other hand, they say, 'If we do this, it will cost too much.' The previous speaker was saying both. He couldn't work out which one he wanted to do. He is better than that, frankly. We have a lot of respect for him on this side of the chamber, but he is better than running that circuitous, false argument that he did today.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Overseas, other countries are looking at what we've done. They're looking at carbon tariffs. They're looking at the former government's stubbornness, truculence and obstinacy about taking action on climate change. They are looking at the fact that this government, the Albanese Labor government, wants to take action on climate change. If we take no action on climate change, we risk carbon tariffs from those in Europe and elsewhere. Other countries are discussing that. We're risking that by doing nothing. At the last federal election, we saw the people of Australia give a clear message. They'd had enough of the division. They'd had enough of the dysfunction. They voted for a party and individuals who wanted to take action on climate change.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Some of those opposite, from their contributions today, seem to think that somehow they were put on the other side of the chamber accidentally, inadvertently, that the people of Australia made a mistake, and they're really the natural party of government. But they don't show that they're the natural party of government, because they don't show responsibility and listen to the business community, the conservation groups, the unions and other people who want to take action on climate change. They fought amongst themselves and couldn't work out that the people of Australia wanted to do something and take action on climate change because they've experienced floods, fires and all manner of natural disasters, in just about every state and territory.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite couldn't, in nine to 10 years, bring themselves to come up with a policy to take action on climate change. Who can forget direct action? The member for Monash should remember that we wouldn't support direct action, because it was a failure. So they brought in the safeguard mechanism—they brought it in—and today they've spent the whole day trashing their own policy, and they intend to vote against it when this comes to a vote. It's their own policy. So many of those opposite were sitting there, from 2014 onwards, supporting the safeguard mechanism. The trouble was they didn't give it teeth. They weren't taking any action.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In my home city, we've been hit hard by floods—three major floods during my time as the federal MP, in 2011, 2013 and 2022. In my electorate we know that climate change is real. We've experienced climate extremes—droughts, heatwaves, floods. The people in my electorate, whether they're farmers in the Somerset region, business owners in Ipswich or young people in Springfield and Ripley, know that climate change is real.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill builds on what we need to do, what the Labor policy was. Renewable energy alone can't reduce our emissions enough. We need to do more. We won't reduce our emissions unless our top 215 industrial emitters, who are projected to overtake electricity generators as Australia's leading source of emissions, reduce them. Emissions from these 215 facilities account for over 28 per cent—close to 30 per cent—of the nation's total emissions. The safeguard mechanism, devised by those opposite, applies to designated large facilities—those facilities who produce more than 100,000 tonnes of greenhouse gases a year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Before the last election, we put on the table what we were going to do—the Powering Australia plan. We committed to reducing national emissions to 43 per cent below 2005 levels by 2030 and net zero emissions by 2050. We've legislated those changes. As a key part of that, we adopted the Business Council of Australia's recommendation for facilities already covered by the previous coalition government's safeguard mechanism that emissions be reduced gradually and predictably over time to support international competitiveness and economic growth. It's consistent with industry's own commitment to net zero by 2050.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill gives effect to that commitment by delivering an enhanced safeguard mechanism. Combined with subordinate legislation, it sets out a baseline, safeguard rules and Australian carbon credit units—ACCUs. This followed an independent review by Professor Chubb—the Chubb review—to ensure that the carbon credit framework was credible, had coherency and had integrity. The largest emitters will make a proportionate contribution to the 2030 target by reducing the baseline by 4.9 per cent annually from 2024 to 2030. The safeguard mechanism places a limit on the greenhouse gases the largest emitters can emit by assigning each one with a baseline. Each year, the largest emitters need to prove their annual emissions are below the baseline. They have to report to the Clean Energy Regulator. Each facility which emits more greenhouse gases than the baseline must take action to offset the excess emissions by buying and surrendering ACCUs. If facilities produce fewer emissions than their baseline, they are rewarded with safeguard mechanism credits equivalent to one tonne of emissions. These SMCs can be sold or traded to other parties over the baseline to reduce their net emissions. These SMCs are not offsets; they can be banked and they can be used. That's how it operates.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The next stage of what we're doing is to release the draft design of our reforms that will be implemented by regulation. This follows the comprehensive consultation paper and the consideration of more than 200 submissions. Those opposite have just ruled themselves out on this issue. Of course, the safeguard mechanism is not new; the former government brought it in. Really, it's a tacit acceptance that the direct action policy and the Emissions Reduction Fund of those opposite, when they were in government, was a failure. It was never going to meet our emissions targets. Those opposite, in 2020 and 2021, went on to announce a plan to credit safeguard facilities below their baseline, but they never delivered it; we are delivering it. Incredibly, they now oppose it and make speech after speech trying to run this half-baked scare campaign based on some old, tired talking points the member for Monash was raving about just before in the chamber. The chutzpah, the hypocrisy, is simply breathtaking.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The problem is the coalition's policy was so poorly designed that those facilities were allowed to increase their emissions, which is why industry and experts are calling for reform. The coalition has entirely dealt themselves out of any debate here. We've got a situation where the Business Council of Australia, ACCI, the Australian Conservation Foundation, the National Farmers Federation—every group that you would think those opposite might actually listen to, they're not listening to. These reforms are critical, and the business community will have the certainty they've been crying out for. It's been carefully designed to cut pollution in our biggest industrial emitters, minimising costs and allowing industry the flexibility to choose the least-cost abatement opportunities. It's equivalent to taking two-thirds of Australia's cars off the road between now and 2030. It's ambitious, but it's a sensible, prudent and business-friendly option.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Any delay is going to make it harder to hit our target. The fact is that if our reforms are passed there'll be a scheme to bring down emissions from the biggest emitters. If it's not passed, there will be no such scheme and emissions will continue to rise. It's so disappointing that those opposite can't listen to the business community and have decided to oppose this bill, as they did with the National Reconstruction Fund Corporation Bill and with the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme all those years ago.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While it's a disgrace that those opposite have failed to support this, I expected better from the Greens political party; I really did. The Greens come into this place and criticise us constantly about it but don't tell the public that they're actually in a form of negotiation with us. Do the Greens really expect that their supporters—the ones that doorknock for them, hand out how-to-vote cards or vote for them—will be happy if they sit with those opposite and do not take action on climate change, after they torpedoed the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme? It would be an act of folly for the Greens to oppose taking action on climate change twice. When push comes to shove, they would have opposed taking action on climate change twice. Their arguments for wanting to do so would lack all form of credibility. There's an old biblical saying: 'It's not the hearers of the word but the doers who are righteous.' They're not doers, the Greens, if they oppose the legislation. They're just the hearers of the word; they are not the doers.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I call on the Greens political party to do the right thing and vote for this legislation. I'm proud to be on this side of the chamber. We want to take action on climate change. I say to the Greens political party: back this safeguard mechanism. This is a legislated path to taking action on climate change. Do not make the same mistake you made before. Our EU partners, and so many other countries, are implementing carbon boarder adjustment mechanism, or carbon tariffs. That would impact our business community and it would impact jobs. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">As the Minister for Climate Change and Energy has pointed out, it would be irresponsible to place bans on traditional energy supply like coal and gas, so the Greens are really out of step. I would encourage them to listen to the voice of the Mining and Energy Union and the Australia Workers Union, who have urged the Greens to play a part in this legislation, to support this type of work. They should listen to the unions in relation to this issue, and those opposite should listen to the business community.

                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hughes</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:48</span>):  I rise to speak on this bill, the Safeguard Mechanism (Crediting) Amendment Bill 2022, which purports to revise the safeguard mechanism applying to Australia's largest emitters to achieve net zero carbon emissions by 2050. The safeguard mechanism has been designed to accommodate the unique circumstances of the electricity-generation, transport and waste sectors. I was present in the House today when the member for Blair called those on my side a disgrace, on a number of occasions, for our purported failure to support action on climate change and on this legislation. I would just say this on that point: having spent most of my professional career before entering this place as a planning and environmental lawyer, I am particularly interested in this proposed legislation. The coalition does support action on climate change. I support action on climate change. In my first speech in this place, I said: </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">… climate change … is one of the leading contemporary issues facing our country and our world. It is important, though, to remember that when we are talking about climate change it is not just about the climate. It is about the environment. It is about the local environment—the parks, the waterways, the green spaces and biodiversity.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">My approach to this is through traditional conservative and Liberal pathways, using the markets to incentivise businesses to innovate to address both our climate change and the environmental issues facing our nation. As we transition to new technologies and a new economy, we must maintain affordable and reliable energy to Australian households and businesses, and, in that vein, those on my side of the House did not necessarily support the climate change legislation because of the specific 43 per cent mandate. It was not properly explained by the Labor government then as to how they would get there, and this legislation today also demonstrates some intellectual laziness in their approach. I'll talk about that as I go through this legislation. Furthermore, I attended COP27 last year at the invitation of the Coalition for Conservation to understand how other countries throughout the world are moving towards net zero; how industries, farmers, governments and the private sector are moving towards net zero; and how a government can facilitate those industries and businesses to do that in Australia. For the member for Blair to assert that none of us on this side are interested in climate change is completely disingenuous. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The current position in relation to the safeguard mechanism environment in which we find ourselves is that it commenced operation on 1 July 2016—that's right; under a Liberal government, under a coalition government. To date, it has operated as a greenhouse gas emissions reporting mechanism for around 212 of Australia's largest industrial facilities—that is, facilities that emit more than 100,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent in one year. The scheme at the moment applies only to covered emissions, which are defined as scope 1, or direct emissions, including fugitive emissions and emissions from fuel combustion, waste disposal and industrial processes such as cement and steelmaking. Some scope 1 emissions are not covered by the current safeguard mechanism legislation. These include, for example, legacy emissions from the operation of a landfill facility, emissions which occur in the Greater Sunrise unit area or joint petroleum development area, emissions from the operation of a grid connected electricity generator in a year covered by the sectoral baseline and emissions not currently covered under the National Greenhouse and Energy Reporting (Measurement) Determination of 2008. By implication, the definition excludes scope 2 and scope 3 emissions, which are indirect emissions such as emissions from the use of sold products and services. Therefore, at present, if a facility's scope 1 emissions exceed its baseline, the facility can apply for a new baseline or surrender carbon offsets, which for these purposes I will call ACCUs, to offset emissions or apply for a multi-year monitoring period or for an overall exemption. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">An increasing number of facilities—and as at the time of giving this speech we are now at nearly 19 per cent—are now covered by a multi-year monitoring period. This allows a facility to reduce average net emissions over a two- to three-year period. In practice, however, the mechanism applies to facilities mainly in the electricity generation, mining, oil and gas, manufacturing, transport, construction and waste sectors. The mechanism does not apply to smaller enterprises that fall below the reporting threshold currently in the NGER Act. There are also four categories of statutory exclusion from the mechanism 1. The bill purports to amend relevant other legislation to alter the safeguard mechanism so that covered facilities must reduce their scope 1 or direct emissions into the future. This bill at the moment provides that key elements of this scheme will be implemented via amendments to existing legislative instruments made by the minister. This is important as it's talking about changes being made simply through regulation rather than coming back to the House for legislation and consideration, and that will mean that it will bypass the other place in terms of its scrutiny. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">While I and many on this side of the House support changes to support our industries, our organisations, our people and our country to move towards net zero, there are concerns about this specific legislation that have been expressed not only by the coalition but also by key industry stakeholders. Indeed, one part of the member for Blair's speech that I did agree with was that even the Greens party are not supportive of this legislation, albeit for very different reasons. In particular, I have no idea what impact this will have on businesses and industries in my electorate of Hughes. That is because the Labor government has not identified the cost of this legislation to businesses, to our economy and to our people. While I support a debate being held on the question of how we balance the need to reduce emissions to reach a cleaner future, we must balance this against how Australia also remains strong, prosperous and independent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">In government, the coalition, through its introduction of the initial safeguards mechanism legislation, achieved its targets and the economy grew. It grew up to 23 per cent in the nine years the coalition was in office. For example, we met and exceeded Australia's Kyoto targets. We signed Australia on to achieving net zero by 2050. We reduced our emissions by over 20 per cent on our 2005 base level, putting Australia well on track to beat our Paris treaty commitments. After almost a decade of emissions reduction being balanced with economic growth, Labor is now rushing to impose this bill, which could lead to drastic cuts on Australian businesses.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The safeguard mechanism has been working well for years as a system to cap emissions while allowing our economy to grow. Now Labor proposes to change the purpose of the scheme to one that stops emissions by encouraging businesses and backing technology to a scheme that penalises businesses and instead backs greater taxes. The coalition in government supported a trading system that rewarded businesses that voluntarily reduced their emissions. Again, this was very well supported by businesses, so I'm still perplexed as to why the member for Blair said that we did not engage with the business community. The coalition's plan for the safeguard mechanism was to create incentives and support businesses that made the transition to net zero. This is what governments should be about—facilitating an environment where businesses and individuals can move towards net zero.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite the strongest economic headwinds in decades, and having already whacked businesses with higher energy prices, businesses will also now be hit with what is in fact a carbon tax, if this legislation is successful. By pricing carbon dioxide at $75, Australia will have a price that is three times higher than the one set by the previous Labor government, and it's set to rise to $100 by 2030. This could lead to Australian businesses becoming very uncompetitive. Many of our trading partners do not have a carbon tax at that level. Many of our trading partners and international competitors for key industries—this includes cement, copper, coal, gas and iron ore—do not have any national carbon pricing scheme in place at all. This can only then cause our businesses, our exporters, to struggle to compete in these markets. This not only means less export revenue; it means less investment and fewer jobs for Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The government in Australia has already hit Australian households with higher costs of living, and this legislation shows that it is determined to hit them again. The carbon tax could well lead to higher building material costs, higher fuel costs and higher transportation costs that will hit our supply chains, including the food we source from regional Australia. The coalition understand Australians want action on climate change. We support action on climate change. But we in this House, as we vote on this legislation, and Australians in general deserve to know what costs we are all facing under Labor's plan. Again, this is another part of this bill that has remained silent.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It should come as no surprise, but in Labor's rush it has provided no evidence of the impacts of its policy to introduce a carbon tax by reforming the safeguard mechanism. A major reform, like the proposed changes to the safeguard mechanism, means that Australians deserve to know the impacts. So why then is the Labor government keeping the Australian people in the dark? For example, Labor failed to get Treasury to model the impact of this policy before pushing it on Australian industry. On the economic impact of this policy, Labor has again been silent. Australians are not being told how this reform will affect them. The government has claimed that industry supports this policy, but the same government claimed industry supported its industrial relations reforms because they attended its jobs summit.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What we do know is that many of the industries covered by the safeguard mechanism have strong concerns about many aspects of Labor's policy. Key parts of Australian industry such as producers of cement, steel and aluminium are large employers, but these businesses are in hard-to-abate sectors. These are the industries that have been ignored by Labor. Just this week, for example, the CEO of the freight company Aurizon highlighted the perverse incentives in Labor's policy. It has the potential to increase rail freight costs to the point where road transportation becomes cheaper, even though it has a higher emissions intensity. Again, this shows that Labor has not done its homework on this legislation. It shows it has not properly assessed these issues, particularly the potential financial impacts on Australians.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Senate estimates recently confirmed that the government has not undertaken any assessment of the impacts of the policy. Labor did not model the economic impacts of its policy on investment, jobs and growth, and Australians will be the ones left to pay. There is no modelling, for example, on the expanding credit market the government wants to use. There is no assessment of demand for carbon credits or their price. What we do know, though, is if the demand for carbon credits exceeds supply, Australian businesses will be slugged with a $275 penalty per tonne of carbon dioxide.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Therefore, to conclude, the coalition is supportive of moving to net zero. The coalition is not supportive of a lazy bill where the work has not been done to advise Australians on the financial impacts.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="299174" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr LAXALE</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bennelong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:03</span>):  Last year the Albanese government were elected to take climate action, and we've hit the ground running. Amongst a long list of achievements, we also enshrined our emissions reduction targets into law—opposed by those opposite. If our current government and all future governments don't meet those targets, they will be breaking the law.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">This bill, the Safeguard Mechanism (Crediting) Amendment Bill, is a critical policy instrument in our path to achieve these legislative targets. Without this system we will not meet them. While most of the changes to this policy can be done by regulation, this legislation formalises the crediting scheme. This scheme allows those who offset their emissions by more than the mandated 4.9 per cent per year to bank those credits for future years or sell them on a market. This is a good amendment to an important policy. It encourages our largest emitters to go harder and rewards them for doing it. I applaud the minister for bringing this legislation into the chamber and bringing on this debate. But we know that the debate on this piece of legislation is a bit bigger than the technical changes we are seeking to make. On issues of climate, we know through history that, unfortunately, it nearly always is a bit bigger. With the safeguard mechanism, we are faced with an opportunity to take strong climate action that Australia and Bennelong voted for.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">For over a decade, the wellbeing of our planet has been used as a political football rather than being treated as the crisis that it is. The science is clear: climate change is real and it's caused by human activity. The consequences of inaction are dire, with rising sea levels, more extreme weather events and threats to our food and water security very real. We have a responsibility to future generations to act now to reduce our greenhouse gas emissions and to transition to a cleaner, more sustainable economy.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Yet, despite the overwhelming evidence of the need for action, we have found ourselves in an ongoing climate war—one that the people of Australia voted to end. The previous government's record on climate action is one of delay, denial and disregard for the future of our planet, and it's a record the coalition are happy to maintain. They voted against our Climate Change Act, and they have said they will vote against this. You would have thought that after the last election they would have read the room. Australia voted for action on climate change, and those opposite continue to ignore our country.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">On the other side of this place, we have those who deny the science, ignore the warnings of experts and cling to the false promise of continued economic growth at any cost. They had 10 years to do something about climate change and the threat it is to our environment, and they chose over and over again to do nothing. The previous coalition government repealed effective climate policy that was addressing climate change and a policy that encouraged a shift towards cleaner energy sources. The Liberals told Australia and the world that they weren't serious about tackling climate change and that they would not take any urgent action to stem the climate crisis, and then they backed that up with 10 years of inaction.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The former government failed to meet emissions reduction targets, and they delayed the implementation of renewable energy policies. They signed the Paris Agreement but then made sure that their initial emissions reduction targets would be too low to limit global warming, which was the whole point of signing the agreement. They made it clear that the only action they would take would be to issue empty press releases. The National Energy Guarantee, a policy designed to reduce carbon emissions and promote renewable energy, was delayed for years. They had 22 energy policies, and they all failed.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The former government's lack of urgency in implementing renewable energy policies shows a disregard for the urgent threat of climate change and a delay in transitioning to a cleaner energy system. In 2017, those opposite dismissed the link between climate change and the bleaching of the Great Barrier Reef. They had scientific evidence in front of them, but they ignored it. They were being criticised by UNESCO for failing to stop agricultural run-off from impacting ecosystems, and yet again they ignored it. There's a bit of a pattern going on here. Just last year, days before the federal election, it was revealed that those opposite had been hiding a scientific report on mass coral bleaching events on the Great Barrier Reef, trying to cover up the evidence to shield themselves from criticism during the campaign.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite cut funding for two organisations that support the development of renewable energy in Australia. Despite the critical role that these organisations played in the transition to a low-carbon economy, the Liberals and Nationals cut funding to both ARENA and the Clean Energy Finance Corporation in their time in government. The list goes on. The transition to a low-carbon economy requires a significant investment in renewable energy, and both ARENA and the CEFC played a crucial role in facilitating that investment. Those opposite know that their long-term inaction on climate change and the environment cost them at the last election.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's important to know all that context, because here we are yet again. Once again we have a Liberal-National coalition in this place actively opposing and criticising sensible, achievable climate policy. This is a policy that is backed by business and by industry, and it is, in fact, an enhancement of the coalition's own legislation that they brought to government. Not satisfied with blocking government policy, they're now voting against their own policy. It's absurd. Then we have the Greens, and it seems that they haven't learned the lessons from 2009 when they also voted against sensible emissions reduction policy. While I remain hopeful that they can work with the government with sensible and achievable amendments, all indications are that they have continued to take an approach that has been counterproductive and divisive. When we have had opportunities to bring in legislation and policy that plays a significant role in addressing climate change opportunities, the Greens continue to oppose and reject a proposal which the government has a mandate to deliver.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Not only has this uncompromising approach made it difficult to achieve meaningful action on climate change over the past 14 years but it has also created a sense of hostility and division amongst the Australian people. This approach has also alienated many Australians who are concerned about the environment but who are worried about a swift and rapid change. They're painted as climate deniers or enemies of the environment, and the Greens have further entrenched the political polarisation around climate change and made it more difficult to build a broad-based consensus for action. That's what Australians voted for at the last election. It was an opportunity to end the climate wars. Business, industry and the community had a very long look at this policy which was released a long time ago. Labor was delivered a mandate to implement this policy, yet we have those opposite opposing it against the wishes of the majority of industry across the country. Achieving meaningful action on climate change requires cooperation and consensus building between different stakeholders. To date and in our recent history, the Greens have made this more difficult to achieve, as have those opposite. Climate policy should not be political, yet again and again and again, the environment is politicised. It's something that Australians voted to end.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Like many in this place and like many people in my electorate in Bennelong, I too want ambitious action on climate change. I would personally like to see us reach emissions reductions greater than the 43 per cent we have legislated. Like many in my electorate, I too look forward to a time when coal and gas are not an integral part of our electricity generation and when more and more renewable energy is providing emissions-free, cheap power to our grid. I too have reservations on the unlimited use of carbon offsets by big emitters. I too want to ensure that those offsets are genuine and that they stack up. But what's worse is voting down this legislation and destroying the consensus that Australians voted for.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I simply won't stand in the way of a policy that will allow us to make progress and take steps towards our climate goals. I won't be one to shoot down a good policy because it isn't perfect. We've been down that route. We've seen it before, and look where we are today. I won't stop pushing and fighting for ambitious policy in action, but I also understand that Australians voted for consensus and they voted for this policy. It's time for the Greens to recognise the importance of balance and compromise in achieving their environmental goals and to work collaboratively, both in this place and outside, towards a sustainable and prosperous future. We have a responsibility to act now to ensure a sustainable future for generations to come. We need to take action right now to meet our emissions targets. I wish we had another 10 years up our sleeve, but we saw what those opposite did. They wasted that time when we should have been reducing emissions. We need to make sure that our country's largest emitters are playing their part in meeting our national targets. We have the opportunity to do that right now with this bill.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The safeguard mechanism needs to be reformed. With this enhanced version, we can ensure that Australia's transition to net zero is well supported with robust legislation. It will ensure that Australia's largest industrial facilities are on the path to reducing their emissions predictably, gradually and in line with our legislated targets. These reforms will make sure that, as we decarbonise and reduce our emissions, Australian businesses will remain competitive and active. According to a report by the Climate Council, the safeguard mechanism amendment has the potential to reduce emissions from large industrial facilities by up to 50 million tonnes by 2030, which is the equivalent of taking 10 million cars off the road each year.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm aware of the criticisms of some regarding this policy. I want to speak specifically about concerns regarding the offset provisions. It's a matter of reality that we must decarbonise Australia while maintaining and caring for our economy and jobs. This bill gives major industrial emitters—whether they be aluminium smelters, concrete producers or miners—the opportunity to deliver the majority of their emissions reductions by choosing low emissions options while they're planning for their future. This bill will influence the next set of investment decisions by major emitters by prioritising and highlighting low-emissions technologies over other available options.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Carbon offsets provide the opportunity for some, where technology doesn't exist, to have a clear path to net zero. When carbon offsets are done correctly and with integrity, they can ensure that big businesses are funding environmental protection and registration. We know that the minister has taken steps to ensure that our carbon offset system is better than the one we inherited. The Chubb report made further recommendations to the scheme to ensure that it will continue to align with our expectations and best practice, and the government is working with stakeholders to implement those recommendations.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm hopeful that, as our country finally works together and achieves climate consensus, the undisputed short-term need for the use of offsets will diminish. I would hope that future governments could review the use of offsets to encourage real reduction as opposed to just net reduction. Unlike some in this chamber, I don't believe offsets are the same as emissions reductions, but I wholeheartedly acknowledge their importance at the beginning of our nation's decarbonisation journey. I don't believe they should be used in perpetuity and without accountability, but I understand their importance, particularly at the start of this journey.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd say to those opposite to again listen to industry on this. We know that the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry have been very clear in support of this safeguard mechanism. They said:</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Small">This is the best way to secure the planning, investment and innovation that will underpin the decarbonisation of our economy without sacrificing reliability or affordability.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">We have industry calling out for fundamental change to the decade of inaction on climate change, and we have the Australian voting public calling out for the same thing. We cannot waste this opportunity again, as it was wasted years and years ago. That's why industry backs this. That's why our community back this. They're sick of the climate wars. I'd encourage those opposite, in particular the Greens, to support this legislation, which is crucial to the government meeting its emissions reduction targets.</span>

                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">
                    <a href="175696" type="MemberSpeech">
                      <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms STEGGALL</span>
                    </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Warringah</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:18</span>):  I rise to speak on the Safeguard Mechanism (Crediting) Amendment Bill 2022. I'd like to start by noting that it is disappointing how many in this place, on both sides, have talked politics rather than specifics about the legislation and how it could be improved. For example, members of the government, like the member for Bennelong, could have actually engaged with the amendments that have been presented and tabled and said whether or not they intend to support them or argue for them in the caucus room. That's what the public ultimately wants to know.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Since 2019 it has absolutely been my focus to champion stronger action on climate change and put forward sensible solutions that should be able to be bipartisan. I put forward a climate change bill, which in fact would have made this mechanism unnecessary because it would have ensured that we had clear guidance on pathways to decarbonisation from an independent climate change commission. That is a proven method in other countries, like the UK. Unfortunately, that wasn't progressed by the government, so here we are tinkering around the edges of a policy that my predecessor in Warringah implemented when he dismantled the Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, and we know it is a far-from-perfect method. In fact, it has failed to deliver any significant emissions reduction in the heavy industry sector. But, that said, if done right, the safeguard mechanism has the potential to significantly contribute to the achievement of emissions reduction targets. It does cover, in Australia, facilities that emit over 100,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents. These are the biggest emitters in the country, excluding the power companies. There is some argument that, in fact, this should be extended to more facilities that are high emitters and that they should be captured. We know there are about 215 facilities included at present and they represent about 20 per cent of our national emissions. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">It's difficult to comment with finality on the bill because we don't know ultimately where we it will end up, and there are still conversations I'm having with the minister and other members of the crossbench and the Greens in this House and the other place. But it is important to point out that the safeguard mechanism bill is an important pillar of the government's climate policy. We know we had to push the government to acknowledge that the 43 per cent emissions reduction by 2030 is really a floor not a ceiling and that we have to be more ambitious than that, which means the levers we put in place in this bill, the very pillar to deliver the government policy, has to be capable of greater ambition. That's why so many of the amendments are important. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">What this bill does, to cut through all the explanations, is it sets up safeguard mechanism credits as a new form of incentives to help large emitters accelerate decarbonisation. If they overachieve their emissions reduction beyond the 4.9 per cent per annum baseline set by the government then they are given a credit that can be traded to other safeguard facilities at market price. This is a good initiative and one that rewards actual abatement. From there, things get a little bit more complicated. The regulations, the rules around this, are still being developed, and, while there has been good progress in discussions with government, it is still not sufficient. I welcome the consultation process that has occurred so far, but we need to point out that there is room for more ambitious targets if we are genuine in committing to the Paris Agreement and the target temperature of close to 1.5 degrees. In all this discussion, apart from the political grandstanding that goes on in this place, we have to remember what the ultimate goal is, which is keeping warming to a livable status to make sure that we have stable environments in our communities so that our way of life can continue. That has to ultimately be the goal. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The 30 per cent reduction in emissions from safeguard facilities by 2030 is good, but it really should have been 30 per cent from 2005 levels, like all other emissions, not from today's level. The devil's always in the detail of just what you're requiring the industry players to do. Adjustments to baselines for emissions for safeguard facilities and that new facilities will have baselines set in accordance with global best practice are good things. The initiative to set five-year budgets for safeguard facilities post-2030, in fact, is in line with the carbon budgeting approach proposed in my own climate change bill. However, the mechanism does have some gaps. It must address gross emissions. We must prioritise real abatement over purchase of offsets, especially for coal and gas facilities. The mechanism should set a higher decline rate for coal and gas facilities. I totally accept that for about 50 per cent of facilities—heavy industries, steel, ammonia, cement, concrete—it will be incredibly difficult. But for coal and gas it is not difficult, and they should be able to have higher decline rates, which should be in this bill. We should not be allowing unfettered use of carbon offsets to achieve reductions—again, in particular for coal and gas facilities. A new fossil fuel entrant should enter the scheme net neutral. They should be displacing high-emitting alternatives. </span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, we must improve methane measurement reporting and validation, and set these facilities on a path to minimising emissions and capturing methane. Methane is 26 to 28 times more potent than carbon dioxide in capturing heat and creating global heating. It is up to 80 times more potent over the first 20 years of emission. This must be a priority for all these facilities. I'm pleased to hear the government contemplate that there will be a cap on net total emissions for safeguard facilities. That can have a meaningful impact in terms of controlling total emissions from our largest polluters and restricting new entrants. But let's get real: that number in the discussion paper does nothing. It has to make its way into the legislation or even the regulations to have some accountability and to ensure some transparency of achievement.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The number of 1,233 million tonnes of net emissions is far too great. It has allowed room for growth in emissions and new entrants. The minister himself has said there is a buffer zone built into this to allow for new projects. It allows for at least three large new gas projects to come online—Pluto, Browse and Barossa, Western Australian projects—despite the fact the International Energy Agency tells us 'no new coal and gas' to have a chance of staying close to 1.5 degrees. Modelling from RepuTex shows that the potential for new entrants, especially fossil fuel producers, risks blowing out that budget and, with it, our 2030 target. The modelling shows that financially committed new projects will be substantial, totalling some 56.6 million tonnes of CO2 equivalent, leading to the budget being exceeded by 30 million to 35 million tonnes. The minister and the government dispute that, but we should be requiring new fossil fuel entrants to come online net neutral. We need to ensure that they are not adding to emissions and that they don't force other facilities covered by the mechanism to work harder to keep within the overall budget. It pits new entrants against potential growth industries in critical minerals and manufacturing. We've got cement and steel smelters and fertilisers. These are industries that will remain in the future. We need to invest in new energy sources to support their transition, not make their life harder by continuing to approve fossil fuel projects that will increase our emissions but have limited life span.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The new mechanism allows for unfettered use of offsets to achieve reductions. This is concerning and creates a disincentive to invest in onsite abatement and real decarbonisation. It might, in fact, encourage some facilities to wait when we know there is urgency. In other countries such as the US, they are moving on and investing in important new industries such as green hydrogen. The unlimited use of offsets in Australia provides companies the opportunities to wait on decarbonisation and invest in offsets rather than in the inevitable technology and actually abate emissions. We should be working with industry to bring down the cost of green hydrogen as an input and creating incentives for business to decarbonise now, accelerating the transition, and not have any incentive for facilities to wait.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Capping the offsets at $75 per tonne allows industry to pay their way out of cutting emissions more cheaply than the market may otherwise determine. That's concerning. There could be a shortage of credible offsets in the market. Just a few days ago, in fact, the New South Wales Treasury recommended including carbon emission pricing in line with the EU emissions trading scheme that is currently at $123 per tonne and rising in real terms. The escalating cost of offsets is more reflective of current market demand for offsets, and I think it will incentivise the creation of offsets as well as industry to actually invest. We must implement the recommendations of the Chubb review, as a matter of urgency, to boost the integrity of the scheme to ensure that facilities are investing in quality offsets. If not, all this is an accounting trick. It won't add up to anything, and we will have an escalating disaster when it comes to our emissions.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">The bill itself establishes a new form of offset, the safeguard mechanism credit, which is a good thing. This is granted when a facility achieves reductions in emissions greater than the 4.9 per cent decline rate. It is a good thing. We want to incentivise accelerated emissions reduction. The legislation needs to establish a hierarchy of emissions reduction for: firstly, onsite real abatement; secondly, offset projects; and, lastly, as a last resort, purchase of offsets. SMCs—safeguard mechanism credits—represent real growth reductions in emissions. That is what we should be aiming for and prioritising.</span>
                </p>
                <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                  <span class="HPS-Normal">Lastly, it's very important that we address methane. The key gap in this proposed legislation so far is greater transparency and accountability for methane emissions by the designated facilities. Last year, Australia signed up to the Global Methane Pledge: to cut 30 per cent of methane emissions by 2030. Most people think methane just comes from agriculture, and we have this ridiculous discussion about barbecues and farting cows. What we really need to talk about is the fact that fossil fuel mining creates 40 per cent of our methane emissions, and we absolutely can do something about this. This legislation is the mechanism by which we can absolutely do that.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr RAMSEY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grey</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Opposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:30</span>):  Last week I attended the opening of the original and rejuvenated Joy Baluch AM Bridge in Port Augusta. The previous government commissioned the work, through the South Australian government, and there are now two major bridges over this crossroads of Australia. It was a great celebration with the town, and I thank the state minister, Geoff Brock, and the mayor, Linley Shine, for their kind words in relation to my role in helping to secure $160 million for the $200 million project from the federal government. In January, I attended the opening of the Port Wakefield Overpass and the dual lanes project through the community of Port Wakefield, and once again it was a celebration. That was a $90 million contribution from the federal government. We're coming up to Easter, and those motorists heading to Yorke Peninsula will appreciate the fact that we no longer have the traffic jams. They are really looking forward to that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The previous government put a record investment into the electorate of Grey when it comes to roads—well over $1 billion across the length and breadth of my electorate. I will just cover off on some of those projects. There was $250 million for the two projects that I've already mentioned; $100 million for upgrading the Eyre Highway; $50 million for the Barrier Highway; $84 million for the Horrocks Highway, and that work will be complete within weeks; $100 million for the sealing of the Strzelecki Track, which leads from Lyndhurst to Innamincka, close to the Queensland border; $5 million for the Adventure Way, to go the rest of the way from Innamincka to the Queensland border; $113 million for the main road in the APY Lands; $130 million for the upgrade of the Augusta Highway, apart from the duplication, which I will come to in a moment; $114 million for safety upgrades; $8.8 million for the Dublin saleyards turn-off; and $208 million for the Port Wakefield to Lochiel section of the Augusta Highway, for duplication. That's a stretch of over 31 kilometres over the South Hummocks, and most of that work is nearing completion. All of these amounts have been topped up by 20 per cent from the state government. It's an amazing effort and something I'm very proud of—the previous government and my role in bringing that funding to the electorate of Gray.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">What I want to know is: what's next? We have this road, the Augusta Highway, carrying increasing loads of traffic. The freight task is increasing all the time. We have new developments in the north of South Australia. We will probably have BHP's Oak Dam project coming in within the next few years. OZ Minerals is still ramping up at Carrapateena. There is a fertiliser project at Leigh Creek which I'm very hopeful will be coming along. There's more iron ore coming down the road. They will all use the Augusta Highway. In the previous government, we allocated $8 million to assess and develop the plan for the next stage of the Augusta Highway duplication. That's the section between Crystal Brook and Port Pirie, which carries the heaviest loads.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I looked at Labor's October budget, and it commits $400 million in South Australia for the freight highway upgrade program. As far as I can see, this money is designated for the Stuart, Dukes and Augusta highways. I was quite pleased with that figure when I saw it. I thought, 'Well, if we can get a third of that, perhaps we'll be able to get on, with $130 million or so, with doing the section between Crystal Brook and Port Pirie and keep the ball rolling.' But then I read in the fine print that that's over 10 years. Four hundred million over 10 years wouldn't pay for the white posts. I'm really concerned now, having done so much work to get the South Australian roads into a condition where we can actually handle the expansion of the industries happening in the north of the electorate of Gray—these industries that will underwrite the prosperity of South Australia—that the government is pulling away from that ongoing commitment. This government is big on talking about its commitment to the infrastructure of Australia. From that budget line, I can't see where that is coming to roads in Grey, at least. We're heading into another budget. The government will be clipping the lines at the moment and getting the numbers right. But I'm urging them to invest heavily in continuing this upgrade of the South Australian road network.</span>

                  <a href="00AMT" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms VAMVAKINOU</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Calwell</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:35</span>):  Today marks 20 years since the war in Iraq started, a war now widely accepted as being based on false and misleading information, one that was not sanctioned by the UN and whose purpose and promise of democracy and freedom was never realised. This was a war that was led by the coalition of the willing, of which Australia was a member, a war that I and many others in this place stood very strongly against and that the opposition Labor Party at the time also opposed—just as the overwhelming majority of Australians did, marching against the war in record numbers, in their hundreds of thousands, across our cities, together with tens of millions of people around the world. It was a war that the people didn't support but their government did, thus signing Australia up to what we now know was a monumental catastrophe, enacted in our name.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On this day we need to reflect on the events that led to the war in Iraq, on the lessons learnt and on the mistakes and actions that should never be repeated. We have to because the consequences of the Iraq war remain with us today. They remain in the upheaval and destabilisation of an entire region, in the destruction of homelands and displacement of people, in the enormous flow of refugees. They remain in the memory of the killings, the violence and the torture committed in the name of freedom and democracy, in the sidestepping of the rule of law and the principles of democratic justice.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Twenty years later, people across the Middle East continue to be lost to a war which didn't bring any real democracy or freedom. Nor did it bring any security in its aftermath. Instead, it gave rise to sectarianism and corruption. The war in Iraq was wrong. Our so-called humanitarian intervention was ill conceived and prosecuted on falsities. Our pursuit of regime change, favouring pre-emptive military attacks, without UN approval, over seasoned diplomacy set a dangerous standard and precedent which other nations could follow. It is a stain on our collective involvement, and we must learn its lessons.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to acknowledge the Australian defence personnel who, under instruction from the government of the day, did their job as a serving men and women. Many of them lost their lives, and we must honour them for their sacrifice and remember them.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The ramifications of the war in Iraq have had a direct impact in my electorate of Calwell. In the last 20 years, we have settled thousands of refugees from both Iraq wars and from Syria in our local community. I am all too familiar with their stories. They have lost their homes, their families, their children, their friends, their livelihoods, their communities and their sense of being. Distraught and traumatised, they fled the violence and the horrors of the war that raged around them to UN refugee camps in the region, Jordan, Lebanon and Turkey, where they waited their turn to be resettled in other countries. Thousands are still waiting.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those who came to Australia are thankful for our embrace of them. They are thankful for the shelter we have given them, for the security and the safe space, for the opportunity to give their children education and a better life. They are grateful. Many of them, however, have struggled in their new life. It has been difficult to forget what happened to their homeland. They still worry for other members of their families that have been left behind, many still in refugee camps, waiting. Language has been a problem, so too the loss of the dignity that comes with being able to provide for your family. They lost their jobs and careers. Many were doctors and dentists, tradespeople, businesspeople. Not having their work experience and qualifications recognised has been difficult, but they have shown remarkable resilience. As a community they have grown and prospered. Their deep faith sustains them, and they have built new lives here. They are becoming proud Australian citizens, in their hundreds.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I meet so many of them in the many citizenship ceremonies that I attend in my electorate. They have enriched our multicultural community and they have brought with them their ancient Aramaic language, their culture and their festivals. The Chaldean and Assyrian new year celebrations of Akitu, on 1 April, which marks the beginning of the beginning of the harvest festival and the new year, are an iconic presence in Calwell, and I look forward to these celebrations each year. Their soccer clubs are full of budding future soccer stars and they have remained close to their places of worship. The circumstances that brought them here were cruel and violent, but they have found their haven and are proudly calling Australia home. They are forever grateful for the fact that we have embraced them and given them a new opportunity and a new life.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ROBERT</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fadden</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:40</span>):  I rise to speak about the cost-of-living crisis that all Australians are enduring under this government. This evening as I stand here in the House, many families are gathering around their kitchen table frankly discussing how they're going to pay their mortgage bills or power bills. They're discussing with their kids cancelling swimming lessons, netball or soccer. These are tough decisions that families are facing. In many cases, they're being forced to make those decisions simply to put food on the table. This is the reality of Australians dealing with this. This is what they're focusing on while Labor's running around breaking promises, making excuses and announcing new taxes. That's right. As crazy as it sounds, the priority for this government is not to deal with the cost-of-living crisis and the issues Australians are facing. They've got excuses for those. Their priority is taxing Australians years from today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese Labor government could not be more disengaged from the issues of the Australian people right now. The government's priorities are wrong. When the Australian people are turning to them in their hour of need, they're given excuses instead of solutions, and broken promises instead of resultant policies. It's this type of arrogance and prioritisation of politics over people which saw electricity prices double the last time Labor was in government. The residents and small businesses of the northern Gold Coast, who I speak for, are struggling. They know this government has broken its commitment with the Australian people. Surveys continue to flow into my office by the thousands, repeatedly sharing stories of hardship and dismay at the lack of relief and leadership from this government during this cost-of-living crisis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Three days ago a small business owner in my electorate in the northern Gold Coast reached out and advised that their electricity bill had gone up 107 per cent. Karen's business is a large energy consumer and they are in a contested market. However, their business continues to fight for survival. What other choice does Karen have? A Pimpama resident, John, sent me an email which read: 'Hi, Stuart. I just got a communication from Energy Australia, my electricity provider, advising of a 24 per cent increase in the cost of electricity to my home. Can you do me a favour if you get the opportunity and ask our PM why? He said he had it under control and we'd be better off by $247 dollars a year.' The best answer I've got for John is that our PM seems to have forgotten. Indeed, his Labor colleagues seem to have forgotten as well. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite making the promise over 97 times during the election campaign to slash electricity bills by over $270, electricity prices are continuing to spiral under this government. New increases of up to 23.7 percent for households and 25 per cent for small businesses have now been announced on top of the increase from 1 July last year. Proposed increases to the default market offer will ensure that more than half a million householders across Australia will be worse off by up to $564 in New South Wales, $485 in South Australia and $383 in my home state of Queensland. It's little wonder that the number of families on electricity hardship programs has reached record highs under this government. More than 82,000 families are now on hardship arrangements. That's 9,000 more people in hardship than when they formed government. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The cost of everything has gone up under Labor, despite repeated promises about electricity, mortgages and the cost of living being cheaper. Before the election the Prime Minister and Treasurer made a huge array of promises. Remember? They promised to cut your electricity bill by $275. That promise was broken. Cheaper mortgages—broken. No changes to super—well and truly, unashamedly broken. Lower inflation—broken. Remember the promise that 'we're not touching franking credits'? Broken to the tune of $600 million. 'No, industry-wide bargaining is not part of our policy,' the government said—broken. 'We'll do our bit to assist in real wages'—broken. 'We're not about raising taxes'—broken. Remember the promise to cut the costs of consultants and contractors? Broken. Fifty urgent-care clinics within a year of taking office? Broken. Ten months in government, 10 broken promises—that's what this government has got to show.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fremantle</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:45</span>):  Last week the Prime Minister announced the key features of our future submarine program under the AUKUS arrangement. It's another example of the Albanese Labor government acting decisively to resolve and clean up matters that have been left in a mess by the former coalition government. I have concerns about some aspects of the arrangement, but it has to be acknowledged that the work done in a short time to address this core piece of defence procurement and capability has occurred alongside a remarkable surge in both the quality and volume of our diplomatic engagement, and a significant increase of development assistance to the Pacific.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are some features of the AUKUS announcement that are characteristic of the Labor approach. It's notable that, in making the announcement, the Prime Minister emphasised our commitment to the cause of peace. It's notable that both the Minister for Defence and the Minister for Skills and Training have each emphasised the contribution that well-managed defence procurement can make to innovation, skills and industrial capacity. But it should be a statement of the obvious to say that with an undertaking of this scale, complexity, cost and duration there remain considerable risks and uncertainty—that is the plain, hard reality—and if we're not able to have a mature and sensible conversation about those risks there is very little chance we will manage them effectively.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The key feature of the arrangement involves the purchase of US Virginia class submarines at a time when their own production schedule has been under pressure. The design and construction in Australia of the new proposed SSN-AUKUS submarine will require an unprecedented level of sophisticated manufacturing capability. As the representative of one of the two principal defence shipbuilding precincts in Australia, I back our capability. But we know from both the Collins and the French submarine projects that building submarines inevitably takes longer and costs more than you anticipate.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While I support the work of the government, I'm not completely convinced that nuclear propelled submarines are the only or best answer to our strategic needs. I'm not privy to the details of the strategic review, but I find the questions posed by people like Peter Varghese and Allan Gyngell on this topic relevant and substantial. I am concerned about the question of nuclear waste. We haven't yet managed a storage solution for low-level waste after 40 years and more than $50 million. We haven't yet commenced a proper process for the storage of intermediate-level waste. Now we are taking on the challenge of safely disposing of high-level waste—a problem no country has solved.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's worth noting the UK has 13 out-of-service nuclear submarines that, for decades, have awaited defueling and decommissioning. None have yet been decommissioned. Nuclear waste from US submarines is also currently held in temporary storage, after 30 years and $7 billion, without arriving at a permanent storage solution. And I'm not yet convinced that we can adequately deal with the non-proliferation risks involved in what is a novel arrangement by which a non-nuclear weapons state under the NPT comes to acquire weapons-grade material.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The IAEA safeguard arrangements will be spelt out in due course, but there will be some notification and inspection challenges inherent in the nature of submarines that move around considerably and, as you'd expect, secretly. There is no particular reason to expect the AUKUS arrangement will be the only one of its kind.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the end of 2021, I canvassed some of these concerns in the course of the treaties committee in consideration of the high-level ENNPIA agreement that led to the arrangement that has just been announced. For having the temerity to ask legitimate questions about those nonproliferation issues the now opposition leader referred to me in this place as 'Comrade Wilson'. It's an irony that the opposition leader, for all his self-styled tough guy patriotism, appears to not understand the fundamental difference between a liberal democracy and other systems in which asking perfectly reasonable questions is not only forbidden but has dire consequences.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The quality assurance mechanism in our system of governance and decision-making is contestability. We must always be able to have a rigorous and challenging conversation about defence and security matters. The AUKUS agreement, arrived at with some characteristically questionable secrecy by the former government, and some strange ministerial arrangements, is not a sports team of which we have all suddenly become life members. It is a significant partnership with two of our most important and closest allies, but it will only be effective if we do our job as parliamentarians, which is to look closely and ask questions in order to guard against risk.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I could be proved wrong about some of my concerns. Perhaps they're ill-founded in a way that I don't perceive, and I can live with that, but I would be wrong already if I wasn't prepared to identify and voice those concerns which are based on work I've done consistently since I was first elected to this place on some of these issues.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="176304" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr STEVENS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Sturt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:50</span>):  Serendipitously, I would like to follow on from the comments by the previous speaker, the member for Fremantle, and discuss the AUKUS announcement from a different point of view, particularly as a South Australian and particularly because I am very supportive of the opportunity that AUKUS provides. It is an exciting capability for the Royal Australian Navy and that, in and of itself, is something to celebrate. But now my fear and focus, particularly as a South Australian, is to ensure that the economic and industrial outcome matches the hype of the announcement last week. I do have very significant and grave concerns about the deal as it has been outlined and the lack of confirmation and certainty of the industrial outcome here in our country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Other shipbuilding acquisition debates that we've had over the last decade or so have always centred around Australian industry content, and the relevance of that is always to ensure that, when we're talking about sovereign capability, we know that what we're constructing and producing is going to happen, in a substantial sense, within our nation, so that we have that sovereignty. I think the framework of AUKUS was exceptional. The Labor Party have now done the detailed work and come back with a deal. I hope I am wrong in having serious concerns as to whether or not they have the capacity and capability to ensure that the outcome for Australian industry and the Australian economy is what it needs to be.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Two things frighten me. The first is that we are talking about acquiring between three and five submarines from the United States, and I very much hope that it only needs to be three. I very much support acquiring three because it is completely not possible for us to manufacture in this country submarines on a time frame that give us the capability outcome. I will be very happy to see three Virginia class submarines acquired for the Royal Australian Navy on the time line that is outlined. If it ends up being four or five, that, unequivocally, will be at the expense of the promised economic and industrial outcome to our nation. If we're buying five submarines for a navy that is aspiring to have eight, then that is absolutely not going to meet the economic and industrial expectations that I have, particularly as someone who represents the people of Adelaide in this chamber.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other thing that frightens me greatly is that, on the timings that were released as part of the announcement, the AUKUS submarine will first be produced in the United Kingdom a full five years before we finish the construction of our first AUKUS submarine here in Australia. What that means to me is that there is an enormous risk that the vast majority of the economic value of submarine construction, which is through the supply chain, will see an enormous advantage going to firms in the United Kingdom by virtue of the simple fact that they will have already been supplying five years earlier into the supply chain for the UK AUKUS program. If we're not dramatically involved in the supply chain for, potentially, three submarines, that is not the outcome that is being championed, particularly in my home state of South Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm not suggesting that that is necessarily going to occur. I am very concerned that there is a significant risk that it will occur, and it's incumbent upon me and everyone else to watch this very, very closely as the years unfold. Frankly, either scenario is still in the hands of future decision-making and what our government in this country does to make sure we secure the economic outcome. We have to make sure that Australian industry content is a part of all of these discussions and negotiations. We are paying, purportedly, billions of dollars to shipyards not in this country, and we're purchasing three to five submarines not built by Australians. What I am intent on doing as the member for Sturt is ensuring that the economic and industrial value of this matches the great outcome for the Royal Australian Navy.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Makin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:55</span>):  In June it will be 11 years since Julian Assange lost his freedom. He is an Australian citizen. He was first confined to the Ecuadorian embassy in London for seven years from mid-2012, and since April 2019 he has been held in the high-security Belmarsh prison, from where he fights extradition proceedings to the US. If he is taken to the US, he faces 18 charges in what many believe will be a biased legal process that could see him spend the rest of his life in prison. His alleged crime is accessing and publishing secret US military information. The more widely held view is that he is being pursued by the US as retribution for exposing US war crimes, corruption and human rights abuses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Assange case has drawn the attention of countless human rights advocates, legal experts, academics, political leaders, journalists and other people throughout the world, including here in Australia, where, according to polling, the clear majority believe he should be released. There is widespread agreement that the charges against Julian Assange should be dropped. Regardless of any wrongdoing on his part, he has already been severely punished. Furthermore, there are international concerns about US law extending beyond its jurisdiction. Julian Assange is not a US citizen, and he was not in the US when the material was published.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Importantly, Chelsea Manning, the US military intelligence analyst who provided the classified material to Assange, has already been sentenced and released after President Obama commuted her sentence. As an Australian citizen, Julian Assange is not protected by the First Amendment to the US Constitution, which the War of Independence was supposedly fought over and which states in part:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Congress shall make no law … abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press …</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Interestingly, others who similarly published the offending material are not and never have been pursued by the US.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The pursuit and detention of Julian Assange contradicts all of the values which are at the core of Western democracy: freedom of speech, freedom of the press, universal human rights, transparency of government and a justice system with integrity. It is estimated that throughout the world there are one million political prisoners. Many millions more are captive and oppressed in their own homelands, subjected to brutal human rights violations. In Iran, it is claimed that over 750 people have been killed and 30,000 have been detained, whilst others have been mercilessly assaulted and some even sentenced to death for standing up for basic human rights which we in Australia take for granted. The Iranian people and those in other places who are similarly being persecuted are crying out to the West for help, yet our calls for justice on their behalf will have no credibility and will be ridiculed while the persecution of Julian Assange continues.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week the UK, the USA and Australia announced the nuclear submarine deal. It is an agreement where the overriding objective is to provide security for the free world and all the freedoms and human rights we hold dear. Julian Assange's fate rests with the three AUKUS partners. Australia, as a founding nation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the UK—which has a justice system built on the 13th-century Magna Carta, which outlaws arbitrary detention and has been described as 'the foundation of the freedom of the individual against the arbitrary authority of the despot'—and the US, which prides itself on its Bill of Rights, should not allow the ongoing persecution of Julian Assange to diminish their credibility as leading nations of the free world. It seems inconceivable, given that Australia, the UK and the USA have entered into a decades-long, complex AUKUS agreement that binds the three countries so tightly in so many ways for decades to come, that Julian Assange's release cannot also be negotiated. It is time for Julian Assange to be freed. His health is deteriorating and he has suffered enough.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">North Sydney</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:30</span>):  Recent media reports have excitedly proclaimed that the number of electric vehicles on Australian roads has almost doubled in the past year, growing from 44,000 to more than 83,000 by year end. Consumers are taking it upon themselves to move to cleaner methods of private transport. However, while this made for good headlines, EVs still only accounted for just 3.8 per cent of new car sales, with the remaining 96.2 per cent of sales being of petrol or internal combustion engines. Not only is this a problem for our climate, with light vehicles accounting for around 11 per cent of Australia's greenhouse gas emissions; it's a problem for our health. Burning dirty petrol is killing us and imposing huge health costs across our society. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">North Sydney is home to one of the most congested stretches of road in the country, running from the northern end of the Sydney Harbour Bridge along the Warringah Freeway to the Artarmon Road exit. Cars driving on this road produce a variety of noxious emissions, including tiny solid particles that can be inhaled and enter the bloodstream, as well as carbon monoxide and oxides of sulphur and nitrogen. These emissions can cause a range of respiratory, neurological and cardiovascular diseases, as well as adverse birth outcomes and diabetes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A recent study released by the New South Wales government suggests most people in Sydney's greater metropolitan region are exposed to air pollution levels which are considered unsafe by the World Health Organization. Alarmingly, it found light vehicle air pollution caused 110 deaths and $832 million in health costs. Further research from the Melbourne Climate Futures centre shows vehicle emissions in Australia may be annually responsible for over 11,000 premature deaths in adults, over 12,000 cardiovascular hospitalisations, nearly 7,000 respiratory hospitalisations and over 65,000 active asthma cases.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Children are especially vulnerable to the effects of vehicle pollution as their bodies struggle to detoxify any pollutant load, and children living within 75 metres of a major road have nearly a 30 per cent increase of lifetime asthma. Yet we continue to see schools built in areas of high traffic and the removal of trees that have previously provided a potential barrier for schools.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These health issues and deaths by tailpipe emissions are avoidable. Every other country in the OECD has standards for the amount of pollution new vehicles can emit, yet Australia continues to have some of the most polluting vehicles running on some of the dirtiest petrol in the world on our roads.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last year, I presented a private member's bill in this place to ensure cleaner, safer transport for all. With the research clearly sounding the alarm, the solution is tangibly in sight. The North Sydney community calls on the government to move immediately to step in and reduce the social, economic and human costs of vehicle emissions.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Cunningham</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:33</span>):  On Friday 3 February, in celebration of International Women's Day, the IWD Illawarra Committee held their annual awards luncheon. The committee, led by the amazing Vicki Tiegs OAM, comprises leading businesswomen from our region who are working together, in conjunction with other groups of women in the community, to organise and promote activities to celebrate International Women's Day. Since 2005, the committee has raised over half a million dollars for over 20 local women's support organisations. The annual awards luncheon is the largest event of its kind in regional Australia—and possibly the largest nationally—with over 900 people in attendance. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Special recognition must go to International Women's Day Illawarra scholars who were announced at the event. The Gracie Wallis Scholarship for Women with a Disability recipient, Megan Neil, plans to support women with disability in the criminal justice system—a minority that she believes does not get the support that they deserve. The Beryl Lewis Scholarship for Older Women recipient, Jo-Anne Gray, is about to commence her PhD, with a focus on undergraduate nursing students' career intentions to work in aged care. The Kerryn McCann Scholarship for Women in Sport recipient was Danika Matos. Danika's mother, Fay, was diagnosed with terminal breast cancer in 2021, and Danika plans on founding an annual football pink day with 12 NPL teams already making the pledge to participate. The Creative Spirit Scholarship for Women recipient was Ann Lehmann-Kuit. Ann is neurodivergent and has a passion for developing accessible, intergenerational, intercultural networks in the community. The Cate Stevenson Scholarship for Women recipient was Rebecca Moulds. Rebecca recently started a meditation teaching course and plans to study sound healing and yoga to allow her to run free classes for women in the Illawarra living with disability or experiencing trauma. The Aunty Mary Scholarship for Indigenous Women recipient was Dr Jodi Edwards. Jodi is establishing a women and bubs program and a mindfulness and wellbeing program based on Aboriginal cultural philosophy and connecting women to the mother country. The Dr Margaret Gardiner Scholarship for Women recipient was Chelsea Penney. Chelsea is now a full-time research assistant and is currently investigating treatments for lethal brain cancers.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I would like to take a moment to make special mention of Gracie Wallis, whose memory will forever be remembered in the scholarship, which is created to help women with a disability to achieve their dreams. Affectionately called Amazing Grace by her family, Gracie Wallis lived in the same suburb where I grew up, Woonona. Despite Gracie being born with a hypoxic brain injury and cerebral palsy, this never impacted Gracie's ability to make a special connection with those around her. Gracie's mother, the amazing Susan Wallis, always says that disabled does not mean lesser; it just means different. Gracie was one of our key campaigners for the NDIS and she is still at the forefront of my thoughts and indeed my inspiration as I work— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs ANDREWS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">McPherson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:36</span>):  I rise today to speak about a local business success story. It's an amazing story of achievement by a family owned business that is helping people, particularly young women, to gain valuable skills and confidence to realise their dreams every year. The French Beauty Academy is Australia's largest and most prestigious registered training provider for services in the beauty therapy industry. Each year, the French Beauty Academy accepts over 2,000 students into training programs in the areas of beauty services, dermal therapy, laser, make-up, style, massage and medispa therapies. In fact, one in six beauty students in Australia is studying at The French.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">French students, or Frenchies, as they are known, learn theory and practical skills in luxurious salon inspired facilities that are designed to both educate and inspire, and they certainly do. The academy's reputation for quality and professionalism means more than 90 per cent of dual diploma graduates secure a job before course completion. That is exactly what we need to be happening right across the industry and all industries. I was delighted to open The French's Robina campus nearly a decade ago, and last week I had the pleasure of officially launching their newest flagship program, the Future of Beauty, as they partner with the biggest names in skin and device technologies to co-develop an industry leading and cutting edge skin focused program.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia's spend on cosmetic treatments has topped $1 billion, and their popularity continues to rise. Our spend is amongst the highest in the world, and a growing number of Australians are incorporating cosmetic procedures into their beauty and grooming routines. As a very proud advocate for the advancement of women in education and providing more opportunities for women in our labour force, I'm so pleased to witness the pathways for the next generation of beauty entrepreneurs being created. Despite beauty and aesthetics being a billion dollar industry in this country, it's not a profession that gets a lot of discussion in this place, so it's important to recognise those who work in this field, delivering an in-demand service. The skills acquired are often highly technical and many are actually an art form that take study, practice and determination.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, I'd like to take a minute to recognise and thank the French family—Sherelle, Alan, Luke and David—who have created so many opportunities for others through their business and who are constantly giving back to the community as well. I'm proud that this Gold Coast business is expanding and leading the world in a growing industry.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Reid</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:39</span>):  Next Saturday is election day in New South Wales. What a great day! I have four of the best local Labor candidates running in my area: Jason Yat-Sen Li, in Strathfield; Julia Little, in Drummoyne; Donna Davis, in Parramatta; and Lynda Voltz, in Auburn.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since coming into office, the member for Strathfield, Jason Li, has not wasted a day. He is out and about, listening to the concerns of residents and business owners. There are three things I know about Jason. He is incredibly hardworking, super smart and committed to serving the community. It's what he has done for much of his adult life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Of all of the Labor candidates in my area, I've known Julia Little, the Labor candidate for Drummoyne, the longest. In the 15 years I've known her, I've been impressed by her commitment to serving the local community. She is a local mum and councillor and has spent years working to make our community a better place. Every time I walk down the main street with her, people stop Julia to thank her for fixing one of their issues or to let her know about an issue that they have. She is accessible and responsive and cares deeply about the community she has lived in her whole life.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Mayor of Parramatta and Labor candidate Donna Davis is a true local champion. We've been working closely together to help fix key issues in Wentworth Point. I've been really pleased to work with her to upgrade Hill Road in Wentworth Point. For years, local residents have been asking for a set of traffic lights at the intersection of Hill Road and Bennelong Parkway. The traffic is terrible and there are near misses and crashes every day. It took a Labor mayor and a Labor federal member of parliament to finally deliver on this much-needed upgrade. I'm proud to see that work has already begun on that intersection. That's what locals are going to get with Donna Davis—someone who is acting to make their lives better.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Auburn, Lynda Voltz, is a fighter for her community. She is a wonderful advocate for local organisations and is well known throughout her electorate. I'm really grateful to her for her friendship and generosity since I've become the member for Reid.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Jason, Julia, Donna and Lynda are part of the Minns Labor team. After 12 years in government, the New South Wales coalition do not deserve another four. They have neglected essential services in the state. Our hospitals are understaffed, our teachers are leaving the profession and ambulance waiting times have blown out. It's only the Minns team that have a positive plan to repair our health system, act to help with the cost of living and back local manufacturing to create jobs. They have a positive plan for New South Wales.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bonner</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:42</span>):  Ensuring Australia has strong, reliable and resilient sovereign capabilities is a priority we all should and must share. In Australia, it's no small thing to say that we are lucky to have some of the best researchers, developers and specialised manufacturers in the world. One such company that is pushing the boundaries in research and development is AnteoTech. AnteoTech is located in Brisbane Technology Park, and I had the pleasure of recently visiting this great Australian company. The team at AnteoTech introduced me to their two key areas of research—the first being life science, encompassing point-of-care diagnostic testing and solutions, and the second being energy, with a core focus on revolutionising battery design. Both areas are key to securing Australia's future.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The life science team at AnteoTech have developed AnteoBind. AnteoBind is a unique and powerful solution that makes point-of-care testing and diagnosis more effective, efficient and, more importantly, accurate. Not only can AnteoBind be used to test for diseases like COVID-19, it has the potential to be used for testing in other areas, such as the agricultural industry, which is worth over $71 billion to our economy. Foot-and-mouth disease in Indonesia still poses a very real and very current threat to the Australian livestock industry. Whilst we can be thankful for our strong biosecurity measures that have so far kept this disease from re-entering Australia, we cannot become complacent. Imagine having a point-of-care test at the airport, ready to use for returning Australians and for incoming tourists. A point-of-care test for foot-and-mouth disease would help prevent this disease from re-entering our country, which would devastate our livestock industry and would endanger our food security.</span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Research into secure, dependable and cheap electricity and storage is vital for Australia's future, and that is exactly what the team at AnteoTech's energy division are doing. With the ever-increasing performance demands for energy storage systems, consumer electronics and electric vehicles, AnteoTech's research and development into more cost-effective, lighter and more compact silicon based batteries is crucial for the development of a green economy. I am pleased to say that I'm working with the Minister for Industry and Science and the member for Moreton, and together we're organising a joint visit to this great Australian and Brisbane company. I'm looking forward to visiting AnteoTech with my colleagues so that they can see first-hand the incredible potential this company has in helping to ensure a stronger and more resilient Australia.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bendigo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:45</span>):  March is a very special time in Bendigo in Central Victoria. It is very much known as the festival month. Starting with the Labour Day long weekend, two festivals that I was really proud to go to and support included Applefest in Harcourt, which celebrates the beginning of the apple harvest season. The very following day, I was at the Taradale Mineral Springs Festival, which is based at the site of the mineral springs. Both festivals are key to the Mount Alexander calendar and bring together the community. They are community based festivals. Quite often, they are not attended by a lot of community members because they are busy putting the festival on. Both festivals have 100 volunteers to help put them on and they welcome people from all over Central Victoria and Melbourne to the region.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last weekend was the Harmony Festival in the mall in Bendigo, organised in partnership with the City of Greater Bendigo and the Loddon Campaspe Multicultural Services. The festival celebrates the diversity of our region, the many groups that make up Bendigo, from our very early days in the goldfields with the Bendigo Chinese to more recent arrivals, the Karen community and the Afghan community, two groups that are making a huge contribution.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Also last weekend we celebrated Pride in Roseland Park, a beautiful gathering of Pride organisations from across the region and organisations that celebrate Pride. It was a wonderful family event with storytelling to dancing, lots of glitter, lots of colour, lots of rainbows, which my son Charlie absolutely adored. It brought together rainbows, glitter and bubbles, three of his favourite things.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Coming up, we have the Dahlia and Arts Festival celebrating its 50th year, which will begin with a walk through Eaglehawk to the park, where we celebrate everything that is Eaglehawk and beyond. In April we have the Maldon Easter Fair in its 146th year and Bendigo Easter festival, including the 150th Easter parade in Bendigo, one of the longest Easter parades we have in our country. COVID and then a severe rain event last year delayed the walking of the 150th parade for three years but this year it'll the first year that our Dai Gum Loong, our newest dragon, will walk on its own. It is a wonderful achievement to hit the 150th year of this parade. Again, it speaks to that long history we have in Greater Bendigo and in our region of celebrating our diversity. These festivals enrich our community. I'd like to thank all of our volunteers and the organising committees for what they do. I know many of them are taking a short break before they'll start planning next year's festivals. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Casey</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:48</span>):  It was a big weekend in Casey celebrating many festivals and markets. The Celebrate Mooroolbark Festival ran over Saturday and Sunday, celebrating its 21st birthday. It is a great event that brings together local residents, community groups and local businesses. It was wonderful to catch up with Mark and the team at Mooroolbark CFA; the Mooroolbark Girl Guides; the Mooroolbark Boys and Girls Brigade; Ken and the team at the Mooroolbark Men's Shed; Josh and Debbie from Hope City Mission; Neal and Debbie from Holy Fools; Harry and Barb from Caladenia Dementia Care; Helen on the committee from the Mooroolbark committee garden, which is getting that established as we speak; as well as Maarten and Manuel from Drawn Out Dads—dads who have started their own businesses drawing comics while working during the day, a fantastic story. To local strawberry farmers Clara and Linda: it was great to have those farm-fresh strawberries on the day. I also caught up with Neville and the team from the Mooroolbark Bowls Club and Andrew and Barbara from the Lilydale Rotary Club, who were helping out as volunteers. I want to give a shout-out and thank you to Liz Ryan, the committee, the volunteers and the stallholders for a wonderful celebration of our community.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We had the Australian Chin Community Arts and Multicultural Festival on Saturday. It was an amazing celebration of their performances, traditional music and sport. The Chin wrestling was amazing to watch for the first time. If you have not seen Chin wrestling, go and watch a match. It shows amazing athletic ability. There were musical performances. There were tributes to those in Myanmar who are still fighting today and tributes to previous generations. It was touching to hear those tributes. It was also touching to see the younger generation of the Chin community who were born in Australia, the four and five-year-olds, and the traditions of their homeland still being continued. The Chin are of Tibetan origin. They're from Myanmar. They've suffered widespread and ongoing ethnic and religious persecution since 1960. Many of the community now call Casey home. I'm proud to work with them and continue to represent their community. They're an amazing community that adds so much to Casey.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also had Wandin North Primary School's harvest fair on Sunday. This is a big day. Circle it in the calendar. It's a great fundraiser for Wandin North Primary School. Congratulations to Principal Paul Bailey, all the staff, parents and teachers on a successful event. It was great to see everyone back together again. It was also great to see Dave from Treasuring our Trees. He's a force of nature. His organisation came about after the June storms of 2021, which devastated our community. He's turned that into a positive. He's created a nature and sensory garden, starting at Wandin North Primary School, so that something good could come out of something that was terrible for our community. It was great to visit there last week and to see how excited the parents and kids were for that garden, which is only weeks away from opening.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Parramatta</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:51</span>):  Last week I hosted a seniors morning tea in Parramatta. Around 300 seniors from all across the electorate came for a morning of local entertainment and a talk on e-safety by the local police command. It was a joy to bring local seniors together and celebrate the contributions made by local seniors throughout their lives. First and foremost, I'd like to express my gratitude to everybody who made this event possible. I want to thank the students from Parramatta High, who sang the National Anthem; the Newington seniors choir for their musical performance; the Parramatta Police Area Command for their e-safety talk; and the Parramatta Salvos for providing the venue, helping to organising the event and being, as they always are, right at the centre of our community.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Seniors laid the foundation of Parramatta's modern success through their contributions to the local community. They worked hard, built homes, started businesses and raised families. Parramatta's success today is the product of their aspirations achieved. Because of this, local seniors are the fountain of wisdom that we must tap into, respect and cherish. One of the best perks of this job is connecting with the people of Parramatta. What made last week's seniors morning tea a personal highlight for me was being able to meet so many local seniors. They brought with them a wealth of stories and personal experiences as diverse as the places and backgrounds they came from. Many told stories of hope and courage, stories ranging from immigrants building new lives and new homes in Parramatta to locals following lifelong passions, taking risks, creating successful careers and supporting others.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also heard stories of hardship from the many pressures facing local seniors today. Whether it be taking care of children or grandchildren, dealing with a rising cost of living or volunteering to support local communities and social networks, seniors today need our support to help ease the pressure so that they can live out their lives with dignity that they deserve. That's why my office has greater the Parramatta seniors guide to help locals navigate life as a senior. Anybody who would like a copy can sign up on my website to receive one for free. Thank you again to the hundreds of people who attended our seniors morning tea last week. I hope to see you again at the next one.</span>

Today I want to pay tribute to our most recent local sporting champions for their talent, diligence and determination. As the parents of a multiclass swimmer, Leonie and I know as well as anyone the monotony of 4 am pool drop-offs, road trips to competitions and all that comes with nurturing burgeoning athletic talent. Actually, Leonie knows it more than I do, because I'm often either here or doing something else. So in paying tribute to our champions I also pay tribute to their parents, caregivers, coaches and mentors. Thank you for the sacrifices that you've made to give our champions the chance to thrive.</span>

Some of those I've just mentioned couldn't come to my office last week, but I want to say to all those young athletes, whether they were there or not: your local community on the Sunshine Coast is so very proud of you for the dedication and the hard work that you put in. I was telling the young people and their parents who were there that it's really important that they recognise the sacrifices their parents and their coaches make to give them every opportunity. I always make it a bit of a ritual that—it's a little bit embarrassing—they need to go and give mum and dad a bit of a hug and say thank you for their dedication and what they give up to allow their young people to excel in sport. Once again, the Sunshine Coast is so very proud of you, young athletes. Well done.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="248181" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms CLAYDON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Newcastle</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Deputy Speaker</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">10:57</span>):  I have just returned this morning from the most amazing behind-the-scenes tour of the National Library. The National Library is an integral part of our national identity and heritage, and it is crucial that we ensure it is properly maintained and resourced, which is why I rise to speak today about Trove, the National Library's premier program that digitises and provides free access to a treasure trove of artefacts, curiosities and stories from Australia's cultural, community and research institutions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is vital that people who cannot access libraries and institutions in person are able to access these collections online. Trove has become a vital part of Australia's cultural infrastructure, with approximately 20 million visits per year. It's enabled users from across Australia and the globe to access newspapers, gazettes, magazines, images, maps, artefacts, reports, diaries, letters, books, archives, music, video, audio material and, importantly, archived websites that would otherwise be out of reach.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">University of Newcastle professor Lyndall Ryan used Trove to gather major sources of evidence for her project to create a digital map of colonial frontier massacre sites across Australia. Professor Ryan's team accessed more than 90 newspapers on Trove from across Australia, and without this kind of information to follow up the project would not have succeeded. Trove is a national treasure, a vital educational resource and crucial for the preservation of Australia's history, and it must be properly maintained and resourced for future generations.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am delighted to rise today to acknowledge some of the incredible Novocastrians who were recognised in the Australia Day honours this year. Mrs Dorothy Ebbott was awarded the Order of Australia medal for exceptional service to the Newcastle and Hunter District Historical Society and commitment to the preservation of our rich local history. Professor Maralyn Foureur received her OAM for significant service to nursing in the field of midwifery and her outstanding contribution and commitment to the health and maternity sector. Professor Brian Kelly was awarded a Member of the Order of Australia for his outstanding contribution and commitment in the field of medical education and research excellence. Mr Henry Scruton was awarded the Australian emergency services Medal for his distinguished service to duty. Mrs Rhona Scruton received her OAM for exceptional service to Surf Life Saving—in particular, her outstanding contribution and commitment to Hunter Surf Life Saving and her longstanding service to the Newcastle community. Mr Patrick Slattery was awarded an OAM for his decade of service to the Newcastle community through a range of roles. Mr Andrew Traill was awarded an OAM for his exceptional service to Newcastle, as was Ms Tanya Wilks.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Climate has been used as a political football over the last 10 years, used to score points and divide communities rather than improve our society. The last decade has seen 22 energy policies, but not one has improved the lives of Australians and instead they have left us in the mess that we are in currently with rising power bills and limited supply. Australia should have been, with its enviable position, at the forefront of new and emerging technologies. We have all the raw materials and the expertise here ready to provide Australians what they want: greener, cleaner and available energy to power homes, businesses and their future. Instead, all the inaction has left us languishing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">However, since coming to office the Albanese Labor government has turned this around, and the list is impressive. We have strengthened Australia's 2030 emissions reduction target to 43 per cent. We have passed the first real climate change bill in a decade through the parliament. We have hosted the Sydney Energy Forum with energy ministers from key allied countries. We have signed the Australia-US Net Zero Technology Acceleration Partnership. We have signed a $200 million climate and infrastructure partnership with Indonesia. We have endorsed at the Pacific Island Forum Leaders Meeting a bid to host COP 29. We have agreed to the Energy Market Operator's Integrated System Plan to upgrade our electricity grid.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have made sure that the Renewable Energy Agency can't invest in things like coal and gas. We passed the electric car tax discount through the House of Representatives, making EVs more affordable. We have established Australia's first real National Electric Vehicle Strategy. We have limited the amount of sulphur in petrol, saving millions in health related costs. We have expanded the Nationwide House Energy Rating Scheme. We have announced the first areas of offshore wind development in Australia. We have appointed an Australian ambassador for climate change. We have signed a partnership to jointly fund the critical Marinus Link transmission project. We have signed an agreement to jointly fund Victorian offshore wind projects, REZs and the Victoria to New South Wales connector. We have tightened noxious emissions standards for trucks and buses.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've also announced $224 million for the Community Batteries for Household Solar Program to deploy 400 community-scale batteries for almost 100,000 Australian households. We've announced $102 million for community solar banks for 25,000 Australians living in apartments, rentals and low-income households. We've announced $63.9 million to invest in dispatchable storage technologies such as large-scale battery projects. We've announced $62.6 million for Energy Efficiency Grants for Small and Medium Enterprises to reduce their energy use and lower their energy bills. We've announced $83.8 million to develop and deploy First Nation community microgrid projects for remote communities. We are continuing to reform the safeguard mechanisms to reduce emissions from Australia's biggest emitters and review the ACCUs so that we have confidence in our carbon credit system. This isn't a complete list, and we are continuing to work every day to bring about these changes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Business Council of Australia, Australian Industry Group, and the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Investment have urged bipartisan support for the government's measures, including the reforms to the safeguard mechanism. Renewable investors are already responding positively to the Albanese government's strong emissions reduction targets and stable policy environment. Business understands this, industry understands this and the unions understand this. The 2022 emission project report and annual statement show that the actions and policies of this government so far have placed Australia on track for 40 per cent emissions reduction by 2030. That is, we've lifted the outlook by a third in just the first six months of our government. What is further promising is that the projections do not yet include the Powering Australia measures, such as some elements of the Powering the Regions Fund and the National Electric Vehicle Strategy. Policies that our government received a mandate for and are working on implementing will result in the 43 per cent.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a cause for optimism, and the shift that has occurred over a short time since the May election means that we will meet our projections, and we will be a cleaner, greener place. Australia can be a renewable energy superpower, and we can be part of the solution to climate change.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="138932" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr TED O'BRIEN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fairfax</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:06</span>):  I thank the member for Werriwa for putting forward this motion today on climate action—a motion with which I disagree. I do believe we need to recognise that the vast majority of Australians do want action on climate change. The need for action on climate change is not up for debate in this House, in this parliament. Both sides of the parliament believe in the need for action. Indeed, the coalition demonstrated that in government. Over our period in government, emissions were reduced by more than 20 per cent. In our last year of government, Australia saw its annual rate of emissions 77 million tonnes lower than when we came to government in 2013. Indeed, investment in renewables was at an all-time high. We not only smashed our Kyoto targets but were well on track to beat our Paris Agreement targets. And of course it was the coalition government that signed Australia up to the goal of net zero by 2050.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The challenge here is often about getting the balance right—the balance with the economy. So yes, we did see emissions come down by more than 20 per cent under the coalition. But the economy also grew by more than 23 per cent. It's all about striking that balance. And it's on that balance where the government is now starting to lose its way when it comes to its climate and energy agenda. I point to (1)(c) in the member's motion, where she states:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">action on climate change is beneficial both environmentally and economically;</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Well, it can be. Under the coalition it was; under Labor it isn't.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This gives rise to the key area of difference between the coalition and Labor when it comes to action on climate change. There is no argument around why to take action but rather around how. It's all around the question of how. How do we decarbonise the Australian economy? Labor has lost its balance, and we see it here through the member's motion. It is very biased to specific technologies. Instead of taking a pragmatic approach where all the above is necessary, the Labor government is doubling down on its very selected set of technologies. Unlike most of our peer nations across the world, this government has decided that gas in particular must be removed from the Australian economy. The failure of this entire motion from the member for Werriwa to address gas goes to the heart of the problem.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese Labor government is trying to kill gas in the Australian economy. Now, we know that because it removed gas from the capacity mechanism. It refused to accept the Kurri Kurri plant as a gas plant, seeking to change that design, therefore leading to a very unfortunate postponement of the Kurri Kurri plant. We know that the changes it made through the gas intervention just before Christmas have heightened sovereign risk and that, as a result, we have a lot of gas companies now holding back on their investments. Also, the changes they are looking at with the ADGSM are causing a similar impact, where gas companies are now holding back. They ripped $100 million out of the budget for gas projects.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then only last week we saw two big pieces of news this this area, and this goes to the scoreboard that those opposite should be looking at. The first piece of news was the draft DMO that said energy prices on Australia's east coast will be going up by between another 20 per cent and over 30 per cent, depending on where you are. Secondly, AEMO came out and pointed to a dramatic shortfall in gas, which is threatening the reliability of our grid moving forward. Lastly, I would say to those opposite that, as you focus on the how, you also need to demonstrate emissions, since you failed on prices and you failed on reliability. So far, you are falling short of your emissions target. We never did.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">… a classic illustration of how if we are only prepared to plan five years, 10 years, 15 years or 20 years down the track all the dangers that are feared can be avoided.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Climate change is now real and present. As Barack Obama quoted:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">We are the first generation to feel the impact of climate change and the last generation that can do something about it.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Australian Research Council's recent report on the state of weather and climate extremes outlines the year of record-breaking extreme events experienced in Australia last year. Climate change is no longer on the horizon. It is no longer just within the purview of a prescient and lonely minister for science. Now it is squarely before the Minister for Emergency Management, the Minister for Health and Aged Care, the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Home Affairs, the Minister for Defence and every other minister, and now we have an extremely busy Minister for Climate Change and Energy.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The legislation and programs this government is currently putting in place require a consensus across the parliament—if not a consensus on the best way to move forward, at least a consensus on the fact that man-made climate warming requires man-made climate solutions. As the saying goes, trust in God but tether your camel. We need to agree on the emissions targets set in legislation and to agree that they are floors, not ceilings; that engagement with our trading partners requires serious commitment to emissions reductions; that we are in a position to benefit from development, new industries and new supply chains; and that first-mover advantages exist only for first movers and that we haven't moved for many years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to meet the challenges posed by the US Inflation Reduction Act and the responses to it in Europe and other countries. We need to look for ways to leverage our natural advantages to refine more of our resources at home and at source. We need to move energy production to the sites of manufacture and, alternatively, move manufacture to the sites of energy production. We need to become a leader in our region so that our successes and progress towards our emissions goals and renewable targets can be an inspiration and a model for our near neighbours, who are then perhaps most likely to become long-term customers of our green energy production. We need to have incentives and disincentives in place, like the safeguard mechanism, to underpin action across the economy, and we need the investment environment that the National Reconstruction Fund will provide to ensure that our innovators can find a foothold each step of the way.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just a few days ago in Hazelmere, in my electorate of Hasluck, as part of the site visit hosted by Fortescue Futures Industries for the Joint Standing Committee on Trade and Investment Growth, I stood dwarfed by the wheel of a dump truck that runs on electricity powered by green hydrogen. It's a working prototype, and that company aims to have its whole fleet of over 200 vehicles powered by renewables by 2030. It's a picture of what is possible with commitment from industry and support from government. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Following the site visit on Friday last week at the committee's public hearing in Perth, we heard from the WA government, the Future Battery Industries CRC and the Perth USAsia Centre. One common thread to their submissions was that we need to act now to maximise the benefits of the economic opportunities that present themselves in what is otherwise a time of crisis. The US has taken action with the passing of the Inflation Reduction Act last year, which according to <span style="font-style:italic;">Forbes</span> magazine, and I agree, has transformed the US from laggard to leader in climate change. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia has been a laggard for 10 years, but no longer. In every area where we can now be a leader, we have a moral, political and economic imperative to lead. As the Climate Council and others have stressed, the process of greening the energy requirements and decarbonisation for much of our industries—across steel, aluminium, chemical and fertilisers, mining, concrete, batteries and others—can also be a process of bringing manufacturing onshore. Of course, there is still more to do, such as harmonising our regulatory framework across the states and the Commonwealth, creating an efficient approvals process and establishing an integrated transition network that is agnostic about the energy molecule. The parliament has a duty to assist in bedding down the programs that will make a difference.</span>

This trend will continue with climate change, as will the trend of record-setting disasters that devastate communities in the country and the region happening back-to-back and ever closer together. Storms, floods, fires, droughts—rinse and repeat—sounds exhausting because it is. Ask the people of Lismore.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">What's required is cohesive, intersecting, whole-of-government policy across portfolios, not just in the climate change portfolio but also in industry, agriculture, foreign and regional affairs, trade, national security, environment and health as well as education and science. This requires cohesive, intersecting policy-making—across portfolios—that doesn't contradict itself, such as by setting climate targets while cutting down native forest and approving new coal and gas. It's not about just investing more in certain technologies or industries, although these economic opportunities will be crucial.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Without action and a shift to cleaner, greener, more efficient and cheaper manufacturing and technologies our children will not see the benefits of well-paid, highly skilled and secure employment. Without action on climate change, our prosperity is at risk. According to the CSIRO, if Australia fails to address climate change adequately, real wages will be 50 per cent lower in 2060 than if we take all the steps needed. GDP growth will slow by 0.7 per cent per year. This should alarm all Australians. Indeed, without embracing technology change amid our climate policies, the IPCC has predicted that Australian living standards, wages and productivity will decline by mid-century. This task is one that requires a climate lens to everything we do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Dr Glasser warned of the very real risks to democracy, governance, and national and regional security caused by this cascading collision of consequences from escalating climate change. One very pertinent example he highlighted is that increasing dependence on the Australian Defence Force to maintain order, effectively to perform as military police, could erode respect for the role of the ADF, and if that is undermined it will challenge faith in Australia's democracy. And not just here, Dr Glasser points out that the Indonesian archipelago accounts for 11 per cent of total global coastline exposed to climate induced sea level rise and has the fastest sea level rise in the world by far. We have seen historically how spikes in food prices, notably cooking oil and rice, have sparked conflict and instability in Indonesia. Indeed, it was one of the reasons for the fall of the Suharto regime. It means, says Dr Glasser, climate change will create space for non-state actors to fill the gaps and also for transnational terrorism to thrive.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the face of all of this, the current government is taking some steps—some, but not enough. Take the safeguard mechanism legislation currently before the House. As it currently stands the mechanism would mean that some of our biggest polluters can continue to ramp up production. Australia's coal and gas exports can continue to increase and the safeguard gives them a green tick to do so. The safeguard mechanism should be about integrity and accountability. We cannot account our way to zero. We owe true emissions reduction to our children and to our communities.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr CHARLTON</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Parramatta</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:21</span>):  I am proud to rise today in support of this motion and I thank the member for Werriwa for bringing this issue forward. There was once a time when people spoke about climate change as a challenge for future generations. Its predicted impacts were long into the future—well, not anymore. Climate change has moved from a theory to an evidence-based prediction to a current reality. In my electorate of Parramatta people experience searing hot summers, their daily activities are affected by urban heat and our city is under annual threat from devastating floods. Today no Australian is immune from the impacts of climate change.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Until recently, Australia wasn't acting on this challenge. We lagged behind as the world moved forward in tackling climate change. We had a lack of policy certainty; a last-minute, half-hearted commitment from the former government; a decade of progress and potential wasted. That was what the former government delivered on one of the biggest challenges of our generation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For a decade Liberal leaders fuelled the culture war and spent their time playing politics over delivering climate change policies. Tony Abbott said in 2009 that the science of human caused climate change was 'crap'. If that wasn't bad enough, he said, in a speech in London, that climate change was, 'probably doing good'. Malcolm Turnbull, that very same year, said his own party did not believe in human caused global warming. In total, the coalition has had 22 different climate policies and five leaders, none of whom have had any coherence on this issue. Not one of them has been able to land a coherent climate policy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For a decade the coalition saw climate change as a political discussion that needed to be shut down, pushed aside and silenced, but in doing so they missed the voices of businesses across Australia who cried out for leadership on this issue. For a decade they got no leadership. For a decade they got no certainty. And now, as business moves towards net zero with concrete plans and targets, they have left the coalition behind. They haven't got the certainty that they needed. For the Liberal Party, the self-proclaimed party of business, to be left behind by business on this issue, to provide no leadership to that constituency, to be sitting on the sidelines while businesses are making plans to hit their targets to implement concrete plans to reduce their emissions is a disgrace.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In May the Australia people voted to end this chaos, and this government hasn't wasted a day in delivering a cleaner future for Australia. One of the things we did as a government was to legislate an ambitious but achievable emissions reduction target of 43 per cent by 2030 and net zero by 2050. This is an important step towards providing real certainty to investors in low-emissions technology and research. We have made strides in showing the world that Australia is back and open for business when it comes to cooperation on climate change action. Since May we have hosted the Sydney Energy Forum and energy ministers from key ally countries, we've signed the Australia-US Net Zero Technology Acceleration Partnership and we've signed a $200 million climate and infrastructure partnership with Indonesia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Cook once stood up in front of the world at COP26 and claimed that we are acting on climate change 'the Australian way'. The Australian way, I'm happy to say, is no longer to lock ourselves an echo chamber of climate scepticism and denial. It's no longer to fail to provide business certainty. It's no longer to ignore the realities of climate change impacting the daily lives of Australians. Thanks to the Albanese Labor government, the Australian way is now to act on climate change while working cooperatively with other nations. The Australian way on climate change is to address this future challenge while delivering good jobs for Australian workers. The Australian way is to provide certainty for business across the country. Most importantly, the Australian way is to be truthful and frank about this challenge and how much worse it would be if we do not act now.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Warringah</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:26</span>):  I thank the member for Werriwa for this motion and acknowledge that the government is at least doing something to address the challenge of climate change. But let's get real. It's not enough. At midnight tonight the UN IPCC will release the <span style="font-style:italic;">S</span><span style="font-style:italic;">ynthesis report</span> unveiling key findings of climate change from the last seven-year cycle. It won't be pretty.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The situation is dire, particularly in Australia. Catastrophes between July 2021 and July 2022 have cost the insurance industry some $5.28 billion on the east coast, predominantly from the floods, to give just one small example. By 2050 it is expected to be in the vicinity of $39 billion per year. In Australia the extinction rate of native species is the worst in the world, and yet we continue to increase native forest logging and there is not been a commitment by either Labor or the coalition to end immediately native forest logging.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need to set greater ambitions. The government set a political target for the 2022 election to be less bad on climate than the coalition. That does not make it a good actor on climate change. We urgently need to set a 2035 target that is meaningful to give business and industry the investment road map to plan ahead. Australian state governments are broadly committed to at least 70 to 80 per cent by 2035. The UK is committed to 78 per cent by 2035. Germany is committed to 88 per cent emissions reduction by 2040. We need to set a trajectory for greater action. When the Albanese government passed its Climate Change Act late last year, setting as a floor its political ambition of 43 per cent emissions reduction by 2030, it acknowledged that this was a floor and not a ceiling. Let's get real about where the next target needs to be if we are going to be meaningful. It must be 75 per cent by 2035 as a minimum the government must aim for to comply with the goal of the Paris Agreement and limiting warming to close to 1.5 degrees. The rest of the world is acting. We need to step up to our responsibility.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The US Inflation Reduction Act is a US$400 billion to US$800 billion government fund that is pulling huge amounts of capital skills and knowledge to the US. If we don't respond, it will have a huge impact on Australia's ability to realise its potential as a renewable energy superpower. We can't just say the words; we actually have to match it with policy for it to happen. This motion highlights the opportunity of green hydrogen, and I agree. Deloitte analysis shows that the US IRA threatens the development of that industry in Australia. It will delay the commencement of scaled production to 2035, and that will reduce our potential exports by 65 per cent annually by 2050.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The EU has recognised this risk and just last week announced its response: the Net Zero Industry Act, alongside its Critical Raw Materials Act, representing a direct climate and investment strategy to respond to the US IRA. These policies aim to onshore manufacturing of at least 40 per cent of clean technologies by 2030. The Gulf states are also responding and getting ahead of Australia. We need a concerted government response to crowd in the $3.3 trillion in private super wealth and seize this nation-building opportunity. Capital and production follow certainty, ambition and strategic government investment. Last week German company Volkswagen threatened to prioritise, over other jurisdictions, a US based $16 billion battery plant in response to the IRA. Fortescue Metals and Woodside Energy have highlighted that they will pursue green hydrogen investments in the US ahead of Australia on the basis of those subsidies available. There is no matching policy from the government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have to talk about methane. This motion highlights that the government has signed on to the 30 by 30 pledge to reduce methane emissions, yet, to date, there has been nothing from the government to actually do something about methane emissions. The safeguard mechanism is before parliament, and it is an opportunity to introduce world-leading practice to Australia's largest emitters of methane outside of the agricultural sector. Methane is 26 times more potent at capturing warming that CO2. It must be addressed. I've put forward amendments, and we've had constructive discussions, but the government needs to come to the table with a real commitment when it comes to those emissions. I welcome this motion, but we have a lot more to do.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bennelong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:31</span>):  I thank the member for Werriwa for bringing this motion to this place because we know that the impact of climate change on our planet is a grave threat to the safety and wellbeing of our communities. We have a responsibility to act now and to ensure a sustainable future for generations to come. Australia has long been known for its pristine natural beauty, from the Great Barrier Reef to the vast expanses of the outback. However, we cannot afford to take this beauty for granted any longer. Our planet is facing unprecedented levels of carbon emissions, rising sea levels and extreme weather events, all of which profoundly impact our environment and economy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In May last year the people of Australia made it clear with their votes that they wanted a government committed to taking strong action on climate change. Climate was one of the top issues in Bennelong and was why voters changed their vote for the first time in nearly a decade. Like many here, I'm here to listen my community's voice and to do my bit to make sure that this government takes strong action on climate change because we simply don't have time to continue fighting on this. We have to work together to find innovative solutions to reduce our carbon footprint, promote renewable energy and protect our environment. Caring for the environment and reducing emissions should not be political. We know that those from the far left and those from the far right have used climate to wedge governments, particularly Labor governments. Because of that, we've lost a decade of action. Emissions were going down under a former Labor government, and that was all unpicked and politicised. Because of the far left and the far right we've gone backwards, and that simply has to end.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">According to the Australian Bureau of Meteorology, 2019 was the hottest year on record, with the national mean temperature 1.52 degrees above the 30-year average that came before it. Of the five hottest years on record, four occurred between 2016 and 2019. Long-term heatwaves are increasing the risk of devastating bushfires, reducing crop yields and negatively impacting our great native flora and fauna. With huge increases in droughts, bushfires, floods and rising sea levels, on top of the heatwaves and coral bleaching, it's too late to continue to deny that climate change isn't real and isn't genuinely impacting our country. This is why we elected a new government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In May last year the Liberals, who took little-to-no meaningful action to protect our environment and to reduce emissions, were voted out. After a decade of wasted opportunity from the former government, this government hasn't wasted a day in implementing the mandate we were given at the last election. In less than a year we've strengthened Australia's 2030 emissions reduction target and become one of the only countries in the world to legislate that target; we've implemented Australia's first real national electric vehicles strategy; we've announced the first areas of offshore wind development in Australia, continuing on our path to becoming a renewable energy powerhouse; we've invested billions of dollars in upgrading our electricity grid to be able to handle the increased amount of renewable energy we need to reduce emissions; we've appointed an Australian ambassador for climate change; we've joined the Global Methane Pledge; we've funded community batteries right across the nation, including one in North Epping, in my very own electorate of Bennelong; and this week we'll debate a crucial piece of legislation that will force our biggest polluters to reduce their carbon emissions.  Importantly, all these measures were election commitments. This government has a mandate to implement them, and once they are in place, I'll be one of many in this place to continue to push the government to go further.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We all know that these measures are just the beginning. Stability and leadership on climate policy is crucial. When governments lead on climate, our community follows. According to the 2022 emissions projection report, this government has lifted the outlook for Australian emissions reduction by one-third in the first six months of its term. So I'm more than hopeful that we'll beat our legislated 43 per cent target, working together with our community and businesses who expect us to. Over the course of this week, we'll be hearing more speakers for and against the safeguard mechanism reforms. I urge all in this place to work together to commit to taking action on climate change and not to continue to politicise this crucial policy area.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australia used to be a leader on action on climate change. Let us return Australia to the forefront of the fight against climate change and let us ensure that our children and grandchildren inherit a world that is safe, healthy and prosperous.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kooyong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:36</span>):  We've all heard many times from the IPCC, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, that the effect of climate change on our environment and on the situation globally can only be ameliorated by strong, immediate and effective action on our carbon emissions. We know that the Albanese government has in front of this parliament at this time a piece of legislation, the Safeguard Mechanism (Crediting) Amendment Bill, which is aimed at decreasing carbon emissions over the next 10 to 15 years. But the problem with that piece of legislation and with most of the pieces of legislation we've seen on this to date, is that they're too small, they're too iterative, they lack the vision that we need to see and they're not going to be effective in producing the immediate reduction in carbon emissions that we need to see.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The issue with the safeguard mechanism as it currently stands is that it makes it possible for the high emitters to completely offset their carbon emissions by means of initiatives like the Australian carbon credit units—the ACCU scheme—or the safeguard mechanism credits, which we know, and which were proven most recently in the review undertaken by Professor Ian Chubb, to be ineffective. Essentially what we're doing is fancy maths and creative accounting with our future. The steps that have been suggested by the Albanese government with the safeguard mechanism and similar pieces of legislation will not be effective to the extent that we need them to be effective.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I do thank the member for Werriwa for this motion, and I acknowledge the fact that we really do need strong action in this area, but the reality is that the initiatives that have been suggested by the government to date are insufficiently strong. We know that there are means by which we can support industry in decreasing its emissions more effectively over time, but the mitigation strategies that have been suggested to date are, unfortunately, unlikely to be effective enough to produce the changes that we need to see.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Knowing that we need to decrease our emissions by more than the 43 per cent that this current government has set out by 2030—that we need to go to 75 per cent by 2035—we need to have more vision. We need to have more courage. We need to be more steadfast in the face of the pressures placed on us by the fossil fuel industries and other lobby groups. We need to demonstrate an understanding of the science and an ability to move with that science in a more effective way than we have to date. I support the member's motion, but I encourage the government to act with more courage, with more consideration of the science of these matters, and more quickly and effectively to protect all of our futures.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">All Australians want and expect our older Australians to be well supported and cared for in our community, including in residential aged-care homes. Just weeks ago, the Labor Minister for Aged Care's op-ed stated:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… older people in residential aged care will have access to a registered nurse 24 hours, 7 days a week.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, in a rush to tick and flick an election commitment, the Albanese government has failed to consider the practical reality of national workforce shortages in this area. The lack of registered nurses to meet the 1 July deadline is at a critical level in rural, regional and remote community aged-care facilities. This feedback comes directly from the aged-care providers in our electorates. They are desperately concerned as to how they will meet this requirement. Various reports show that the sector needs approximately 20,000 to 21,000 additional workers. A UTS report showed that less than five per cent of the surveyed aged-care facilities currently had the direct care workforce needed to meet the Labor government's 1 July deadline. Where does the Labor government plan for these nurses to come from?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition has consistently and repeatedly raised concerns with the government regarding the capacity of the sector, particularly those in rural, regional and remote areas, to meet these mandatory workforce requirements. In Senate estimates last year, the government could not—or would not—give straight answers to the shadow minister for aged care. This was regarding just how many new staff were required to meet the 1 July regulation and what provisions are actually in place to support those great providers in our electorates who simply cannot meet this requirement in spite of their best efforts. Where will the additional registered nurses, enrolled nurses and care workforce come from in the midst of what is a significant nationwide labour shortage? Is the government planning to take staff from one health sector at the expense of another? I note that the WA state government's move to a one-to-four staff ratio during the day and a one-to-seven staff ratio at night in the health space will add to the demands on supplying staff in aged care.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We cannot afford to lose any of our aged-care providers, particularly those in rural, regional and remote areas. They are hanging on by their fingernails right now. Sixty-four per cent of facilities in major cities are operating at a loss, and that increases to around 70 per cent in regional, rural and remote facilities in our part of the world. In response to the aged-care royal commission, the coalition invested over $19.1 billion in aged care. In this space, the government has mentioned some exemptions for some facilities. I spoke to a provider in my electorate on Friday. They said it is just so difficult; the amount of time and cost in applying for and maintaining an exemption is extraordinary. There's additional time and cost and reporting. They simply cannot source the required number of registered nurses, in spite of their best efforts, both in Victoria and overseas. They're simply not available. They estimate that, at capacity, this facility will need another eight to nine full-time registered nurses. But where will they come from? It is difficult and expensive to attract suitably qualified overseas trained nurses. They've even used a third party to help source these nurses, subsidising the accommodation of those they can employ. This is already affecting their star rating and will have an even greater impact when those clinical care minutes apply from 1 July.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Will this mean that we'll start to lose more of our smaller facilities? We've got some quite small rural, regional and remote facilities, and they are already struggling to survive. That's something we know right now. What happens to our older Australians in those remote and regional communities if these aged-care homes have to close? I look at wonderful places in my part of the world, like the wonderful Tuia Lodge, with a relatively small number of people. They battle every day to provide those fabulous services to the people they love and care for. Hocart Lodge in Harvey does the same thing, as does Armstrong Village and Capecare in Dunsborough. I know in my colleague Rick Wilson's electorate of O'Connor there are significant issues facing the smaller aged-care provider in places like Katanning. These are the ones we are desperately concerned about, and we want to make sure our older Australians have the care they need.</span>

The member for Forrest in her contribution raised some questions, and I think it'd be timely for me to give her some answers to those questions—that aged-care homes that genuinely try to meet the requirement and recruit registered nurses will not be shut down because they can't fill the positions. Let's start there. Older Australians from rural and regional Australia will not be forced to travel miles away from their community to receive support, because their providers can apply for an exemption.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To listen to members of the opposition now speak about aged care is galling—a fearmongering campaign about the improvements to aged care not meeting a time line that was suddenly set by an opposition that for a decade ignored what was happening in aged care, ignored the need for a wage rise for aged-care workers to maintain them in the system and to recruit and retain workers in the aged-care system. So I take this opportunity with relish, because let's be frank about what this motion from the coalition is arguing against. It's arguing against getting more registered nurses into aged-care homes. It's arguing against treating older Australians with greater dignity. It's arguing for refusing to increase care access. It's arguing for refusing to lift standards—in an industry that the whole country knows needs to lift those standards, after the damning reports from the royal commission. It is astonishing that after those shameful findings of the royal commission, delivered on the opposition's watch in government, that the coalition is still actively trying to stop older Australians from getting the care they need.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">After 10 years of neglect, the coalition is still trying to slow down and delay reform in aged care. Let's have a look at that 10 years. Let's have a really good look at it. In December 2013 former Prime Minister Tony Abbott scrapped Labor's $1.2 billion aged-care workforce compact, which would have delivered a pay rise to aged-care workers in 2013. In May 2016 former Treasurer Scott Morrison cut $2.5 billion from aged care over four years. In 2018 they ignored the key recommendations of the Aged Care Workforce Strategy Taskforce report. On 31 March 2021 the Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety released its shocking final report, describing the government's approach to care as 'the minimum commitment it could get away with'.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In contrast, this Labor government is putting things in place, starting with fixing the workforce shortage. It's not going to be easy, but the Albanese Labor government are using every tool in our kit to achieve it. In the October budget we delivered $473 million to help providers get their 24/7 nurses. We're delivering a 15 per cent pay rise for aged-care workers to attract and retain the workforce. We're increasing the permanent migration program ceiling to 195,000 in 2022-23 to help ease widespread critical workforce shortages, one of which of course includes aged care. We're providing an additional $1 billion in joint federal-state funding for fee-free TAFE in 2023 and accelerating delivery of 465,000 fee-free TAFE places. We're extending visas and relaxing work restrictions on international students to strengthen the pipeline of skilled labour and providing additional funding to resolve the visa backlog. We're allowing people on the age pension and the veteran pension to earn an additional $4,000. Someone I met quite recently who was working in aged care and was on the age pension is making the most of that. We've done all of that in less than a year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In comparison, Labor campaigned from opposition; Labor called out the then coalition government for years. And I will finish with this: in my electorate in the middle of the pandemic, aged-care facilities had no PPE on the ground, and that was on the former government's watch. The former government was responsible for the provision of those things, and when they were needed in my community—when the infection hit the aged-care facilities in my community—there was no PPE on the ground. I know that because I helped deliver it. I had to ring the then minister and ask for his assistance to deliver on what should already have been apparently needed and delivered to my community.</span>

                  <a href="HWS" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr RAMSEY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Grey</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Opposition Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:51</span>):  I'm given to reflect that the government is fast learning the difference between opposition and government. In opposition, everything looks so easy. It's easy to throw stones, but, of course, the buck stops with the government, and the government is in place now and they have been disingenuous. In fact, that contribution from the member for Lalor was exactly that. It was the coalition government that took funding for aged care from $13.3 billion in 2013 through to $30 billion in 2022. That's a 126 per cent increase. I wouldn't call that a dereliction of duty.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In opposition, Labor provided 60,000 home-care packages, or a little fewer. When they came to government there were around 220,000, so there was around about a quadrupling of home-care packages. That also is not a dereliction of duty; that's an incredibly big effort. Now, they can say there should be more, and they've been given the opportunity now to do more, but they might find it's not quite as easy, as I said, from government as they first thought.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Firstly, it's a reasonable question to ask: why were there only 60,000 home-care packages when Labor were in government and when they left government? Secondly, what would they have done to ensure there were more than 220,000 when they came to government? Having said all that, they said in opposition that they would fix aged care and, in fact, they were campaigning in April, May and June last year for a 25 per cent increase in aged-care wages. Eventually the Fair Work Commission settled on 15 per cent and, to be fair, the government doesn't actually have to do what the Fair Work Commission says. They could give 25 per cent if they wish—they are the major funder of aged care—but they went along with the 15 per cent. But not only have they not now, 10 months later, delivered the 15 per cent; they haven't delivered the 10 per cent. Now it has been whittled down to 10 per cent in June and five per cent in June next year. So not only have they not delivered on their promise to the people in May; they haven't delivered on the 10 per cent that the Fair Work Commission told them to give—so they're still hanging out for that—and we're still 14 months or 15 months away from the 15 per cent.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Now, I've been talking to aged-care providers in my electorate and they're very concerned about some of these decisions of the government. For instance, if you live in the country, one of first things you'll know, Mr Deputy Speaker Wilkie, is that our aged-care facilities have to pay above-award rates. So they are already paying 10 or 15 per cent higher and even higher percentages for good aged-care staff. The 15 per cent increase is actually predicated on the award rate, so if they are paying above that, are they going to tell these nurses, 'I'm sorry, you can't have a pay increase because you've already got over-reward rates,' or are they going to be forced to give the 10 per cent on top of the inflated 10 per cent that is in place already, which is going to further erode their ability to compete and to deliver the services? And we know that many of these nursing homes are losing money.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Further to that, they're very concerned about the stipulation about the mandatory hours—the 24/7 for registered nurses, the 40 minutes a week from a registered nurse, rising to 44 minutes by, I think, 2030, and the 200 minutes from other aged-care staff. Firstly, I don't know where on earth they're going to get those extra registered nurses—almost 7,000 across Australia mind you. Given that we can't get them in the regional areas anyhow and are often reduced to paying agency rates for those nurses—given that that's difficult to find—they don't know how they're going to meet those mandated timeframes. I was talking to a provider who said, 'We employ more enrolled nurses than the industry average in our component workforce and we believe that gives a better standard of care to our residents.' To fund the registered nurses, if they can find them, they're going to have to cut the ratio down and have fewer enrolled nurses and more aged-care workers that have cert IIIs or whatever in their facilities. They believe that this will erode their capacity to deliver the same high-level care that they are delivering at the moment. They don't see any flexibility in that coming from the government. The member for Lalor says that facilities will not have to— <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms ROBERTS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Pearce</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">11:56</span>):  I rise to respond the motion tabled by the member for Forrest, which allows me an opportunity to highlight the many significant policies of the Albanese Labor government, policies that aim to restore the respect and dignity of older Australians in aged care, just as they deserve. One of the highlights of being a local member is spending time in the community listening to the stories, experiences and needs of my constituents. I welcome that feedback because my job as a federal member for Pearce is to hear and respond to my community and care for their needs to ensure families, businesses and organisations are supported by our government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I meet with many groups, and I have been in regular contact with the group Aged Care Reform Now, which is working for change in the aged-care sector to ensure everyone's loved ones are appropriately looked after. Two fearless advocates that I would like to specifically mention are Amina Schipp and Yvonne Buters, who are driven by dreadful personal experiences of their loved ones in aged care and who are determined to see change for the better. Members of this advocacy group were recently in Parliament House to attend an aged-care roundtable. I can say with all certainty that, as a government, we care. The Albanese Labor government cares deeply about the now and the future of Australian families young and old.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government has a plan, and that plan includes increasing staffing levels to improve the quality and amount of care that older people receive, including putting nurses back into nursing homes. In less than a year our government has already had a positive impact on aged-care workforce shortages. The latest aged-care workforce estimates reveal the overall gap in supply and demand for workers is getting smaller. In 2023-24 the forecast gap in the number of registered nurses needed is now 8,400, down from 11,700. That is strong, steady and welcome progress. Departmental figures estimate that currently 80 per cent of facilities do have a registered nurse onsite 24/7.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government has listened and consulted and we continue to do so. This consultation has taken place with many organisations representing the interests of older Australians and those who look after them. Undoubtedly, workforce and staffing are among the biggest challenges in the economy and the aged-care sector. However, it is important that I remind those opposite that this workforce crisis did not begin on 22 May 2022 when we were elected. For almost a decade the aged-care workforce was neglected by the coalition. And now faced with an opportunity to do good, to correct that shocking history and lack of care for older Australians, it is outstanding that the coalition chooses to argue against this very critical policy to boost the number of registered nurses in aged-care homes. Nobody should argue against treating older Australians with greater dignity. Even after shameful findings of the Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety the coalition is still actively trying to stop older Australians from accessing the care that they need.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In contrast, the Albanese Labor government has achieved a positive change. We delivered $473 million to help facilities provide 24/7 nurses, we are delivering a 15 per cent pay rise for aged-care workers and we are lifting the numbers for the permanent migration program to 195,000 to ease the critical workforce shortages. Rewind back to the coalition's time in government and their record has been less than impressive. In 2013, they scrapped Labor's $1.2 million compact to provide an aged-care pay rise. In 2016, they cut $2.5 billion from aged care. In 2018, they ignored the key recommendations in the aged-care workforce strategy taskforce report. And in 2022, the coalition refused to support a pay rise for aged-care workers. I also call out those opposite for sparking the shameless mischievous rumours that homes will be shut down because they can't get a 24/7 registered nurse. That is blatantly wrong. The importance of returning dignity and respecting our older Australians is a priority for our government, and nobody—nobody—should get in the way of such a crucial objective. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Braddon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:01</span>):  I rise today to speak in support of this very important motion brought forward by my good friend and parliamentary colleague the member for Forrest. She understands the issues and certainly the significant challenges facing the aged-care sector, not just in her region but in rural and regional areas right across Australia. In May last year, Prime Minister Albanese was elected on a promise to fix what he considered to be 'a growing crisis in aged care'. There is nothing more fundamental to meeting that commitment and protecting the lives of our most vulnerable, but Labor has failed on this front. COVID-19 deaths in aged care since the Albanese government was elected have surpassed the total deaths under the former government between 2020 and 2022. In fact, there have been 2,652 COVID deaths in the first eight months under Prime Minister Albanese's watch, compared to 2,415 for the entire two years of the previous government. The minister said that she would put back into aged care the care factor. But instead, she's ripped out measures that the former government had put in place that were protecting older Australians. Sadly, this mismanagement has come with deadly consequences, and the government should apologise to the Australian people for its failure.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The aged-care sector is facing immense challenges on many fronts, including workforce shortages, increased reporting requirements, and ongoing regulatory and compliance changes. But the Albanese government's refusal to listen to them is wearing thin on the industry. The aged-care centres in my region are contacting me daily, saying that the burdens this government is imposing on them will force them to close. Recently, I visited Waratah Lodge in Wagin, Western Australia, with the member for O'Connor, another regional member that just gets his electorate. I met with Kath, the shire president, and her team at the Waratah Lodge, which is a wonderful aged-care home. It was awarded WA's best aged-care facility in 2018. But in 2023, sadly, they're likely to close their doors thanks to the imposed burdens placed upon them by this government. They're saying that Labor's compliance rules for the big capital cities are fine but they're just not workable in the bush, because nurses aren't available, because personnel isn't there, because they run on the smell of an oily rag, because they use community-minded people as volunteers. They're saying that they have accrued a number of savings over the previous years but that these have all gone, have been depleted, and they're now at a crossroads—it's make or break. To throw more money at the problem isn't the answer. There needs to be a complete, holistic strategy formulated specifically for aged-care facilities and home-care packages in regional and remote Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The burden has fallen on to our local shires and local governments, unfortunately. Councils are pitching in and doing their best to keep these places alive. They're injecting their own funds, their own personnel, their own resources in order to keep these homes open. But those funds need to be redirected to somewhere else, unfortunately. Sadly, the Albanese government is sending both our aged-care sector and our local councils broke, shutting down aged-care centres in Queenstown—you'll appreciate this, Deputy Speaker Wilkie—in Smithton or in East Devonport in Tasmania. It might not mean anything to city dwellers, but, I'll tell you what, it means a lot to those elderly folk in those local communities. This will rip regional families apart and isolate people who just want to live and die in the communities that they served their life in and gave their life for. The aged-care minister is blatantly ignoring the pleas from the bush, where they're experiencing unsustainable financial positions due to Labor's accelerated time frame, and this will force regional aged-care homes to close.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In conclusion, Prime Minister Albanese preached to the Australian public in the lead-up to the federal election that he would make it his mission to fix aged care—his mission, he said. To use a military term, this 'mission' must be classified as a mission failure. Not only this, but Labor's intervention has made the situation on the ground far worse than it was when they entered. In government, as in the military, this critical failure must be borne with some consequences. All I'd say to this minister is: you need to start listening to the bush when it comes to aged care because it's a very different situation than that of the big capital cities.</span>

As the member for Gilmore, I am committed to improving the quality of aged care for our communities, getting nurses back into nursing homes and putting our most vulnerable people first. I am proud of the incredible work the Albanese government has done to prioritise aged care in this country. I find it absolutely shameful that the former Liberal government allowed aged care to deteriorate to the neglectful state it was in when we took over government. Even so, the Liberals continue to argue against getting more registered nurses into aged-care homes. They continue to argue against treating older Australians with greater dignity. They are standing in the way of increased care access and improved standards. They are standing in the way of putting 'care' in aged care. After 10 years of neglect, they're still trying to delay critical and necessary reform. It is as if they did not do enough damage to aged care in government; now they're trying their best from opposition—disgraceful. Unlike the Liberals, the Albanese Labor government recognises and, most importantly, respects the contribution older Australians have made to this country. We truly believe in our hearts that they deserve dignity and respect. These are not just hollow words for hollow reasons; it's action because that is what is needed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to tell you a story about Connie from Worrigee. Connie came to me late last year asking for help. Connie needed a new mobility scooter to get around and compression stockings for her legs. She needed domestic support services for the house she shares with her husband. It sounds pretty simple, really. But she was having trouble getting that simple support. I quickly looked into these issues, and I'm delighted that they were soon resolved. Now, Connie can move around more freely with her new scooter, and her home is getting the cleaning services they need. Simple. Connie is just one example of the hundreds of people I have helped to regain their dignity with small changes. I love supporting our community and advocating for those who need it, and I'll always make that a priority.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But it shouldn't have come to this. It shouldn't take going to your local member to get these issues solved. That is why the government is working hard to create an aged-care system which is efficient and fair, an aged care system that puts emphasis back on care. Fixing the workforce shortage isn't going to be easy, but we are using every tool in our kit to achieve it. In the October budget, we delivered $473 million to help healthcare providers get 24/7 registered nurses for facilities. We are delivering a 15 per cent pay rise for aged-care workers so that we can attract and retain more workers to this critical industry. At the same time, we have introduced 180,000 fee-free TAFE places in workforce shortage areas so we can train and build the workforce we need, now and into the future. While we work hard to rebuild the local workforce, we've helped providers meet these new requirements by extending the Pacific Australia Labour Mobility scheme, among other schemes, to help fill those gaps in regional and rural areas, like the New South Wales South Coast. That is already making a difference to local aged-care providers. These are the types of things a Labor government achieves, and all of that in less than one year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That's in stark contrast to the Liberals' record. The Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety described the former government's approach to aged care as 'the minimum commitment it could get away with'. That's the Liberals' record in one sentence. They will do the minimum they can get away with. And what did that get us? The other simple and accurate describer from the Royal Commission, the title of its report: neglect. While the Albanese government is working hard to put nurses back into aged care, the coalition has continued business as usual: fear mongering and spreading misinformation. The vicious rumours that aged-care homes will be shut down because can't get registered nurses are blatantly wrong and dangerous. They should be ashamed to be spreading such lies in order to continue their neglect of local people. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are committed to improving the quality of aged care in Australia. We are taking action to address the workforce crisis, putting nurses back into nursing homes, increasing funding for training and education, and providing financial support for aged-care providers. We will continue doing absolutely everything we can to ensure that every Australian can age with dignity, respect and care. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="281688" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr WEBSTER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mallee</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:11</span>):  I rise to support the motion by the honourable member for Forrest. In particular, I call attention to the University of Technology Sydney Ageing Research Collaborative report, which strikes home at issues raised with me by leadership at many aged-care facilities in Mallee. These issues largely centre around care minute requirements and the lack of registered nurses to meet expedited requirements legislated by the Labor government. The report states that meeting the incoming mandated standards will require an additional 6,922 full-time registered nurses in Australia by 1 July. Meanwhile, at Senate estimates the Department of Health and Aged Care said that an additional 10,000 to 14,000 nurses would be required to fulfil the care requirements due to come into effect by October this year. Less than five per cent of aged-care homes currently have the required direct care workforce needed to fulfil the requirements that will be placed on them. It's astounding: 95 per cent of homes will need to find more staff. And as we know, the workforce is already thin. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is an impossible situation. These figures highlight a serious issue that is only going to get worse over time. Mallee aged-care residential facilities have certainly made it loud and clear to me. Facilities such as Dimboola's Allambi Elderly People's Home, which sadly has had to close recently for this reason. Or Minyip's Dunmunkle Lodge and Donald's Johnson-Goodwin Memorial Home, who have both communicated the issues that they are having. And facilities such as Maryborough's Havilah Hostel, another community institution of over 160 beds that is also facing troubled waters. Two out of three residential facilities around Australia are unviable, and the closer we get to the deadlines this Labor government has determined, the more pressure will be applied. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have been working closely with Mallee aged-care facilities and their communities, listening to their concerns and writing to the ministers concerned, with little to no understanding reporting. In Dimboola, before the closure of Allambi, I faced an impromptu community meeting and delivered their petition to the Prime Minister from the many concerned residents of that town. I recently met with the chief executive of Dunmunkle Lodge, Peter Ballagh, and board member Andrew Clark, and talked through their situation, listening to their proposals as to how they could make their facility remain viable and sustainable. Recently I took the shadow minister for health, Senator Anne Ruston, to Maryborough, where we toured the Havilah Hostel and met with the board. I've been in contact with the federal Minister for Aged Care, Anika Wells, regarding Mallee aged-care facilities, and I would welcome her to visit them with me to see firsthand the reality of their situations. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So far the government has blatantly ignored concerns from both the coalition and the community that their expedited time frame could force aged-care homes to close because they just cannot access staff. This will either see residents sent to overburdened hospitals or see older Australians in rural and regional Australia forced to travel away from their local town to find a residential facility elsewhere, separating them from their families in the final years of their lives. This is simply un-Australian. We want and expect our older Australians to be well supported and cared for in their own communities. That is why in government the coalition called for the Royal Commission into Aged Care Quality and Safety, to ensure oldest and most vulnerable Australians receive care that supports and respects their dignity, and that recognises the important contribution they have made to society. The final report of the royal commission made 148 recommendations, the product of compassionate scrutiny of Australia's aged-care system. In response, the coalition committed $19.1 billion to a five-year plan to improve aged care with new home-care packages, respite services, training places, retention bonuses and infrastructure upgrades. We listened to the experiences of Australians who gave evidence to the royal commission, and I thank each and every one of them. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="298121" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms SITOU</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Reid</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:16</span>):  When I saw this motion coming up for debate I raced to put my name to speak because I find it extraordinary that those opposite are now criticising the Albanese Labor government on our progress to fix aged care. Often times in this place, disagreement or tension is created out of the smallest of differences, and I know that it is just the way politics happens. But on aged care, there really is clear blue water between this government and those opposite, and I was astounded to see this motion framed the way it has been. After 10 years of complete neglect of the aged-care system, I am shocked to see those opposite come in here to criticise our efforts to repair the system. After 10 years of coalition neglect, I am shocked to see those opposite come in here to tell us that we're not doing enough to attract and retain the workforce in aged care. After 10 years of coalition neglect, I am shocked to see those opposite are seeking to condemn this government for cleaning up their mess. We are fixing this broken system, a system those opposite left in a state of disrepair.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Despite that neglect, there are some facilities that are doing well; for example, the Bernard Chan facility in my electorate that I visited with Anika Wells, the minister for aged care, last year. It is providing culturally appropriate care to elderly Chinese Australians. They have bilingual staff, ensuring that elderly are able to speak in their mother tongue; they celebrate Chinese traditions and cook Chinese food so that those Chinese Australians are able to feel comfortable in their final years. They are also exceeding their minutes-of-care requirements. They've managed to do this thanks to committed staff and great management, not thanks to those opposite.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's take a look at what we on this side are doing to attract the workers required for our aged-care system. In the October budget, we delivered $473 million to help providers get nurses on 24 hours a day, seven days a week. We are increasing the permanent migration program ceiling to 193,000 in 2022-23 to help the widespread critical workforce shortage, including in aged care. We are providing an additional $1 billion in joint federal-state funding for 465,000 fee-free TAFE places in 2023, which includes several courses in aged care. Anyone who meets an aged-care worker knows that many of them do this challenging work because they find it rewarding to care for others. But for too long, they have been underpaid for the valuable work that they do. We are delivering on 15 per cent pay rise—15 per cent, think of that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Forrest comes in here complaining about workforce shortages in aged care yet she was part of a government that sat on its hands for almost a decade. They did nothing to make the industry more appealing to workers, nothing to help aged-care workers. Let's take on the last element of this motion. Those opposite are like the emperor without any clothes on, trying to hide behind a fig leaf. That fig leaf is made of vicious and untrue rumours. Aged-care homes that genuinely try to meet the requirements to recruit registered nurses will not be shut down because they can't fill those positions. Older Australians will not have to travel from their community to receive support, because they can apply for an exemption. In their desperate attempt to distract from their own neglect, they are now trying to spread fear and anxiety amongst older Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are putting registered nurses into aged-care homes. We are making a requirement of these facilities to provide a minimum standard of care. The department has estimated that 80 per cent of facilities have a registered nurse on 24/7 and additional facilities are very close to meeting that. Here is my suggestion to those opposite: stop trying to deflect and distract from your own failures. Instead, work with us to help fix this broken system, because older Australians deserve better than this. They deserve a genuine reform of the system. We are doing the hard work now to help fix this problem. You ignored the workforce shortages for too long, for too many years. I'm proud to be part of a government that is helping to fix the mess that you left behind.</span>

              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">March is Endometriosis Awareness Month. It is a chance for all of us to stand not just in this place but with partners and allies across the community to raise awareness and education around endometriosis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">At the beginning of my contribution can I acknowledge two amazing endo warriors who really put this issue on the agenda in this place and nationally: the former member for Canberra, Gai Brodtmann, and the former member for Boothby, Nicolle Flint. This is one of those issues which is bipartisan—in fact, across the parliament we have come together. They were the founding co-chairs of the Parliamentary Friends of Endometriosis Awareness and Education. I also acknowledge my co-chair of this group—we've inherited it from superstars Gai and Nicolle—the current member for Forrest. Nola and I are continuing Gai and Nicolle's legacy and making sure this place doesn't forget the importance of acting on endometriosis awareness. Later this week we will be holding a joint breakfast with Endometriosis Australia in helping to pursue their campaign in relation to this issue.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Endometriosis is a condition where the tissue behaves unusually. The lining of the uterus starts to grow in locations that it shouldn't. It is a chronic condition that causes severe pain to at least one in nine women and girls in Australia. On average it takes about eight years to diagnose. Three out of 10 girls skip class because of painful periods. Some women with endometriosis are in so much pain that they give up work or studies. It's still one of those areas that some women and girls find quite embarrassing. Many girls say they thought the pain was usual. Many women who might be trying to get pregnant or couples who are going through fertility treatment don't find out until that stage that the woman has endometriosis and that it may affect their ability to fall pregnant—a devastating way to find out that that period pain that you've had has actually impacted your ability to have children.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2018 the parliament released and adopted the National Action Plan for Endometriosis, starting the journey of this place—both the previous government and this government—investing in the National Action Plan for Endometriosis. The government committed $22.5 million to support implementing this plan. Its priorities focused on awareness and education, clinical management and care, and research. About $6 million has gone towards awareness and education—the PPEP talks which have been quite popular in schools and are being rolled out in each state in partnership with the states. Also, funding has gone towards clinical management and care, and over $16 million has gone towards research.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This government committed to addressing endometriosis in its 2023 budget, and expanded the budget to $58.3 million to support more initiatives to help improve endometriosis diagnosis and primary care support. This includes funding MRIs for women who suspect that they have severe endometriosis that could be affecting their fertility. Another way in which the government is helping is by funding the endometriosis living guideline support and new and ongoing research into the diagnosis of the condition. This funding will continue support of EndoZone, a digital platform that provides patients with access to evidence based information. These are some of the many things this government is doing to support.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I acknowledge many of the true champions and organisations that support women and their families who believe they may have endometriosis or are trying to live with the chronic condition—people like Lesley and Sylvia Freedman, who are the co-founders of EndoActive, and Donna Ciccia, who is a co-founder and a board member of Endometriosis Australia. These are just two of the many organisations doing their bit. I will give my final shout-out to the Endo Warriors, who never forget or let us in this place forget our role to make sure that this is never again a forgotten issue or condition.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr STEVENS</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Sturt</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:26</span>):  I thank the member for Bendigo moving this motion on endometriosis. It's an excellent opportunity for us to do exactly what Endometriosis Awareness Month is all about and continue to highlight and increase awareness throughout our community and society. So I obviously wholeheartedly support the motion and thank the member for the opportunity to contribute.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst sometimes we might be glib about the attention we think there is in the community to discussions in the Federation Chamber, this is a great example of an opportunity for all of us not just to speak on this but also to push our own speeches and this debate out through all the communications channels that we've got, because it's a very important role for us as parliamentarians to provide leadership in this area. I really want to join the mover's commendation of the former member for Boothby and the former member for Canberra, Nicolle Flint and Gai Brodtmann. I never served with Gai Brodtmann, regrettably, but was always aware of the pioneering contribution she made to endometriosis awareness, particularly through my colleague, who I did serve with, Nicolle Flint, the former member for Boothby. They both have a lot they can reflect on in their careers, but I'm sure the work they did on endometriosis awareness is at least equal to some of the things they're most proud of in their legacy, because they absolutely should be. They've made an enormous difference.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I know, in serving in the Morrison government, when a whole range of initiatives were announced and funded and supported by that government, it was always pointed out by the then Prime Minister and the then health minister that it was the work of Nicolle Flint and Gai Brodtmann and others in the Labor Party that she worked with to make sure that in government there was awareness and action taken about how important it was to be doing more to support endometriosis awareness.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As has already been said, and as others will say, one of the most important things about endometriosis that is such an opportunity for all of us is that it has not been until recent years that it has had the attention it so rightly deserves. It is heartbreaking to be learning stories of people who have taken so long to be diagnosed with endometriosis very much because our society hasn't done as good a job as we are now, and that we can enhance into the future, in making sure that there is awareness of endometriosis and that potential sufferers have a much greater likelihood of getting earlier testing and screening that will identify that. Of course, that early testing screening can make such an enormous impact in treating and managing endometriosis as a health condition.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As a member of parliament I have certainly had experience hearing from members of my community and even friends of mine where their endometriosis has been discovered because of fertility challenges, and it has been at that point that they have for the first time in their life become aware that they have endometriosis. As the previous speaker indicated, it's something that, until that point, has had an unnecessary amount of ambiguity and therefore discomfort and probably even suffering, because it is an undiagnosed condition that once diagnosed opens up a whole range of opportunities to treat and manage. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So we in government need to always come together as much as we can in politics and in this parliament around causes like endometriosis awareness. I don't think anyone would suggest that what the current government is doing, what the previous government has done, is excellent progress, and equally an opportunity to improve upon even further. What we want is that bipartisanship and unity around causes like raising awareness around a condition like endometriosis, supporting each other and ensuring that we're playing our roles as community leaders on supporting endometriosis awareness, and also that governments and our bureaucracy are looking for opportunities to do even more than we already have done in the last few years thanks to the fact that we are all in unity raising these issues. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A final shoutout, as the mover did, to all of the groups and people in our community that are doing so much. They obviously, in particular, deserve the credit for raising levels of awareness. I want to be a part of continuing to support them and everyone in making sure that we continue to improve in this very important area of public health. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macarthur</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:31</span>):  I'd like to thank my friend the member for Bendigo for moving this motion. I'd also like to thank Gai Brodtmann, Nicolle Flint and Nola Marino for making this issue prominent in our parliament. I find in health that when we work in a bipartisan way we can often achieve many things, and I think we have. The funding as part of our 2022-23 budget that Greg Hunt has proposed, the $58 million, is really a terrific start. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is a bit of a mea culpa for me. I've got six kids, and one of my daughters, Amelia, as it turned out, had quite severe endometriosis. But in a busy family of six kids with a father who is a doctor, it was very easy to ignore medical symptoms. I can't remember how many times I told her to be quiet, pack her bag, get in the car and we'd go to school, even though she was having severe abdominal pain. It wasn't until she left school, when she ended up actually in hospital, that the diagnosis of endometriosis was made. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Endometriosis occurs when the lining of the uterus, the endometrium, that's shed with every menstruation, occurs in unusual spots. It can occur in the fallopian tubes, which often causes infertility, and it can occur in the abdomen, which often causes involvement of the ovaries. It can cause severe abdominal pain and can be quite serious. To diagnose it, you must be aware of it. In the current days with Medicare premised on short consultations, it's sometimes difficult for doctors to diagnose endometriosis. But it remains a very common cause of infertility, a common case of days off work. Unless it is recognised, the treatment is very ineffective. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My daughter Amelia actually sorted it out herself and found a doctor who actually listened to her—unlike her father—and she was diagnosed with endometriosis. She did have some quite long-term symptoms and did have infertility for a number of years, and it wasn't until she had some surgery that she was able to have two absolutely gorgeous kids, Frankie and Mia. I'm very proud of her and proud of the journey that she's been on. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I really do feel for women in this situation over undiagnosed endometriosis. It really is a hidden disease. That's why this month is so important, not just because we're standing up as a parliament and saying, 'We hear you,' but because we're standing up as a parliament and saying: 'We will educate you and the community about this. We will provide help for you, and we understand what you've been going through.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's a very common disease. About one in nine women suffer from endometriosis, and, as I've said, it is a common cause of infertility and other health issues. The former Minister for Health, Greg Hunt, really started the ball rolling—I've got to give him credit as well—and now as part of our 2022-23 budget we're continuing that investment, including things like a Medicare funded MRI scan to help with the diagnosis because it's often intra-abdominal or intra-uterine, so it can be hard to diagnose. You need to think of it and assess it quickly so that treatment can be done before damage is caused.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The time has come that those suffering from endometriosis should not continue to suffer with the feeling that no-one is listening to them. We must do more to raise awareness of endometriosis and provide treatment that, in many ways, can save a lot of money by reducing dependence on IVF et cetera. We need to change the way our health system assesses women and women's health issues, because that is another issue. It's very easy for us to forget that women's health issues have been neglected for a long time. We need to make sure that endometriosis is part of the consideration for a doctor whenever they see a woman with problems with periods, recurrent abdominal pain, infertility, abdominal distention et cetera. That is really important. We must treat it properly, but we have to diagnose it first before we treat it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I thank the Minister for Health and Aged Care and all of those involved, the so-called 'endo warriors', for the work that they've done. It is really, really important, for a large section of our population, to get proper treatment, early diagnosis and much, much better outcomes. Endometriosis Awareness Month is important, and it's imperative that each month we make better progress in understanding this disease to better support patients going forward.</span>

The member for Macarthur is much admired as a medical practitioner and as a parliamentarian around this place. The nature of his personal story indicates that, if someone with his distinction as a medical practitioner was not able to identify endometriosis, we as a society have much further to go in needing to encourage medical practitioners across the country to properly diagnose this issue.

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Seeing a photograph of Bindi Irwin in hospital recently, announcing her decade-long battle with endometriosis, will have caught the breath of many Australians, partly because of the realisation that this dynamic young woman with the world at her feet was suffering enormously despite her brave smile, and partly because many of us have seen exactly this sort of bravery and silent pain before, demonstrated by the amazing women that we love. My own wife, Joanna, is extraordinary in countless ways, but when it's come to her own battle with endometriosis, I've seen bravery and endurance that's nothing short of heroic. The ongoing pain, the surgeries and the question marks over fertility are very, very heavy burdens that don't last for weeks or months, but years. Endometriosis affects the lives of women dealing with it. Bindi's words, 'Please be gentle and pause before asking me, or any woman, when we'll be having more children,' ring very true.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Among our neighbours, friends and families, many women are quietly wondering what endometriosis will mean for their possibilities of family and what it will mean for their own body. Many others are silently living in the aftermath of surgeries, having organs removed and trying to deal with the debilitating pain they've lived with. For a condition that's only been historically spoken of rarely, endometriosis is actually very common, with one in nine Australian women suffering from it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Endometriosis is a debilitating condition in which the endometrium, the tissue that normally covers the inside of the uterus, grows outside and around the uterus or on other reproductive organs—the ovaries, the fallopian tubes—and, in extreme cases, on other parts of the body. The symptoms can vary significantly. For many women it means significant pain, nausea and, in some cases, infertility. It can also be present without those symptoms. This is perhaps one of the reasons why endometriosis diagnosis takes far longer than it should. According to Endometriosis Australia it takes on average six and a half years to be diagnosed. There are many misconceptions about the condition in the community. Too many Australian girls and women have suffered silently with endo, believing their severe period pain is normal or just part of being a woman. It's a particular problem, I think, in some multicultural communities where women's health issues remain a serious taboo. This is why raising awareness is essential: so that women no longer have to suffer without support where it's available. The sooner someone is treated, the sooner life can resume as normal.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">March is Endometriosis Awareness Month. It's an important opportunity for us to talk about the disease and encourage women to investigate if they think they might be affected. We also need to talk about it because recent research from universities has found that the lack of understanding is affecting many women in the workplace. The vast majority of women with endo who were surveyed report that endo has impacted their working life in some way: 70 per cent of women with endo have had to take time off work to manage the symptoms they deal with, and one in three of the survey respondents said they'd been overlooked for promotions because of the impact of endo on their working life. We are missing the talents of amazing women.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The estimated cost of endo in Australia each year is significant. A report released in 2019 estimated that endometriosis costs society $9.7 billion annually. The majority of that is not health care, but it's productivity related. For the women who are experiencing the pain of endo, that will be no surprise. The toll on their lives and bodies is inescapable. I want to say to any woman out there who's affected by endometriosis: there is help available. Don't suffer silently. Speak to your doctor, and if you don't make progress go and seek a second opinion.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to celebrate the progress we've made in recent years. I'm proud that when we were in government we invested record levels of funding in the care, diagnosis and treatment of people with endo. In 2022, Prime Minister Morrison announced $58 million of funding for MRI scans and the establishment of endometriosis treatment clinics, and I commend the Albanese government for continuing with the plan. I'm looking forward to seeing the clinics set up and running in due course. I want to also acknowledge all the advocates, the amazing endo warriors in this space, particularly my friend Syl Freedman from EndoActive, who I met when I first became a parliamentarian. Finally, I want to say something to the women who battle endometriosis. On behalf of your husbands, your partners and the people who love you: we think you're incredible. We think you're amazing. We love you and we want to support you in any way we can on this journey. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Corangamite</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:42</span>):  March is Endometriosis Awareness Month, so it is appropriate that in the chamber today we stop to recognise this debilitating, and often hidden, chronic condition. Endometriosis affects one in nine women, hospitalising many thousands each year and taking young women out of the classroom, out of the workforce and out of their lives. I thank the member for Bendigo for this motion, which highlights just how devastating it is to be inflicted with this progressive, chronic condition that can start at puberty and continue beyond menopause.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government acknowledges the pain and hardship that endometriosis can cause, the historical challenges associated with delays in diagnosis, and the past ignorance and judgement that many women have experienced. It's time to do better. Women should not have to endure the excruciating pain, loss and guilt that come with inaction. The Albanese government hears you and we are acting, with the introduction of the National Action Plan for Endometriosis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This plan acts on the words of young women, like Charlotte Mullens, who lives in my region. Women want better and simpler diagnosis and treatment as well as support and greater awareness about the condition. Charlotte said to me in a letter:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The plan responds to Charlotte's plea, with $9 million for greater awareness and education, $50 million for physical management and care, and $21 million for further research. This builds on reforms included in the 2022-23 budget with $58 million to improve endometriosis diagnosis and primary care support, helping more women to find appropriate care and better manage the impacts of endometriosis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Importantly, the package also includes the establishment of specialised GP clinics across Australia, including one in my region. This clinic will address diagnosis delays, promoting early access to intervention, care and treatment options for endometriosis and pelvic pain. Other investments include access to a new Medicare funded magnetic resonance imaging scan, to assist the investigation of infertility for those with severe endometriosis and other conditions; a review of Medicare Benefits Schedule and Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme items used to support the diagnosis and treatment of endometriosis; the development of an endometriosis plan to support patients in primary care; support to the National Endometriosis Clinical and Scientific Trials Network to continue the important research and address research gaps; funding for an endo living guideline to support new and ongoing research into diagnosis and management; promotion of the Australian clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of endometriosis; funding to the Australian Coalition for Endometriosis for increasing awareness amongst priority populations; implementing a mentors program to support those who are newly diagnosed; a workplace assistance program to support employees and employers navigate discussions in the workplace; and continued support for the EndoZone digital platform to provide consumer access to evidence based information.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the words of Charlotte Mullens: you have the power to change the reality for people with endometriosis. We have heard you, Charlotte. We hear all the endometriosis warriors who have fought for greater recognition for treatment of this debilitating condition. It is because of you that the Albanese government is now making groundbreaking reform to better support women with endometriosis. May the reforms we make today ensure it is no longer a hidden disease.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BURNELL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Spence</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:46</span>):  I rise today in this place to speak in support of the motion of my good friend and colleague the member for Bendigo. I would also like to acknowledge all speakers on this matter today and their substantial contributions to this discussion. Today I speak in relation to my experience in watching my wife deal with the realisation that she had been living with this invisible disease for some time, completely unaware of what was happening to her body. As many in this place would understand, there is our public life and there is our private life. Those who know me well know I hold my private life close. From the outset I would like to acknowledge the trust my wife has placed in me to tell our story today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Three and a half years ago my wife, Cassandra, and I said 'I do', getting married surrounded by our family and closest friends. Like many couples, we had a dream of having our own little family, and, given we were both in our early 40s, we knew we had no time to waste in doing so. After months of failed conception we started IVF treatment to assist in the process and hopefully realise our dream. For those that have experienced this, there is not much that isn't discussed, probed or tested to give you the best chance at becoming parents. This would be the time that we would first learn Cassandra had endometriosis. Unfortunately, without cover for private health insurance and with long public hospital wait times for surgery, we reluctantly pushed ahead hoping for the best in what would ultimately result in two unsuccessful rounds of IVF.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When Cassandra finally was able to have surgery, we would learn that the endometriosis was quite severe and had caused organs to stick together. This was not a case of irritable bowel syndrome due to stress; the tearing sensation in her lower abdomen when she coughed was not in her head; it was a very real yet invisible disease. It was a chronic disease, endometriosis. Following surgery, there was a period of mental and physical relief from the symptoms she had been experiencing. Fast forward 12 months, with one last viable embryo, we undertook another round of IVF, albeit unsuccessful yet again.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To our surprise, shortly following my election to this place, we would learn that we had naturally conceived, but our excitement would be short lived. We experienced a miscarriage at approximately nine weeks. This was not long after I gave my first speech. The time following this was of great difficulty. Was the nausea, the bloating and the feeling of sickness all in her head following the miscarriage, or was it something more sinister? We would soon discover endometriosis had been invisibly taking over yet again. While waiting to see the specialist, I watched my wife try to push through the pain, try to push through the nausea and try to push through the fatigue. This often ultimately meant taking time off work because no amount of trying to push through it would make it go away. She was exhausted from dealing with the pain.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">After further tests, the specialist recommended urgent surgery. This surgery occurred only a week and a half ago—as if determined by fate itself—during Endometriosis Awareness Month. This time we had the talented robotic surgeon, Dr Sellva Paramasivam, and others on standby if anything were to go wrong. It resulted in the removal of the right ovary, which was completely covered in endometriosis and had a five-centimetre endometrioma, or chocolate cyst. The left ovary remains attached to the bowel due to the extremely high risk of extensive damage occurring if detachment had been attempted.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">My wife and I understand that we are extremely fortunate to be in the position to have private health insurance and to be able to cover the further out-of-pocket expenses to have this surgery at the Flinders Private Hospital. Unfortunately, many simply cannot afford the same level of treatment we have received. My wife's journey with endometriosis is far from over, but we are hopeful.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our government has committed $49.65 million for clinical management and care, $28.97 million for research and $8.57 million for awareness and education. One in nine women, girls and those assigned female at birth are estimated to be affected by endometriosis. My wife's story is but one of the approximately 800,000 cases of those affected by the disease. Whilst our government's commitments are fantastic, there is still much more to be done.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Flinders</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:52</span>):  According to Endometriosis Australia, there are 830,000 endometriosis patients in Australia. Almost 220,000 of these are in my home state of Victoria. According to the ABS, there are 87,640 women in Flinders, so, by deduction, some 6,000 Flinders women suffer from endometriosis. For women who do not suffer from it, little is known about it; for those who do, it is both life changing and life dominating, starting early in life and enduring throughout most of it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition has a proud history of delivering record funding to improve the diagnosis, care and treatment of more than 800,000 women with endometriosis. The former government was the first to acknowledge and recognise endometriosis and its impacts on women across our country, much of which was spearheaded by my predecessor, Greg Hunt, led by his excellent policy adviser at the time, Ms Briony Hutton. Since then, Briony has been a constant advocate for women suffering endometriosis, no more so than in Hastings, within the Flinders electorate, which she sought to represent at the last Victorian election, losing by only a few hundred votes. I had the chance to reach out to Briony over the weekend and talk to her about endometriosis. In turn, she reached out to a close friend who has suffered from endometriosis for some time and who gave me permission to read out her story, so I will.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The story is that of Bethany Toporzisek, from my electorate of Flinders. I'm able to share her story of endometriosis today. Bethany grew up with her family in Somerville and attended school in Tyabb. At age 26, after exploring every corner of the peninsula and travelling through Europe, she now works as an artisan baker at Flinders Sourdough. At the age of 20, Bethany had her first laparoscopic surgery to determine the cause of chronic and severe pain she had been experiencing for several years in her pelvis, lower back and upper thigh, along with painful digestive complications. When she thought she was suffering from irritable bowel syndrome, she was, to her surprise, diagnosed with endometriosis. Bethany's eventual surgical diagnosis finally made sense of her symptoms and equipped her with the knowledge to seek help. She still suffers from symptoms of endo but has become passionately diligent about her diet and exercise as a way of managing her chronic illness. The average endo diagnosis takes anywhere between seven and 10 years. Bethany hopes that by sharing her story she can encourage other young women experiencing unusual period and digestive symptoms to not accept this as normal and to seek professional help.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">More than $333 million was budgeted in the 2022-23 budget to strengthen health services and make more support available to women and girls through a range of new initiatives, including a focus on endometriosis. As part of this investment, the former government committed $58 million—the largest funding for endometriosis on record, in fact—to support women experiencing endo and improve their quality of life, building on the National Action Plan for Endometriosis to ensure women are diagnosed and supported in the best way possible. It is quite remarkable that a disease that affects so many Australian women was so misunderstood and shrouded in ignorance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This month is Endometriosis Awareness Month. Held in March each year, it raises important awareness of this painful and debilitating condition. Incredible organisations, like Endometriosis Australia, play a vital role in supporting patients throughout their endo journey from diagnosis to treatment and beyond. They are also a wealth of information and provide connections to various support groups around the country.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The 2018 national action plan describes endometriosis as a chronic disease that occurs when cells similar to those that line a woman's uterus grow in other parts of her body, usually around the pelvis, and less commonly in tissues and organs outside it. It is a highly individualised disease, with the symptoms and impact of the disease ranging significantly from person to person. The coalition remains profoundly committed to helping to improve the quality of life for an extraordinary number of Australian women and girls living with endo.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hughes</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">12:57</span>):  I rise to speak on this motion and thank the honourable member for Bendigo for bringing this motion before the House. Endometriosis is very important to women's health. It is a common yet frequently under-recognised chronic disease that affects more than 11 per cent of, or 830,000, Australian women and girls. Often, the disease starts in teenage years. On average, it takes 6½ years for endometriosis to be diagnosed. Clinically, endometriosis happens when tissue similar to the lining of the uterus or womb grows outside the uterus. It is a painful and debilitating condition that often leads to severe chronic pain and, in many cases, infertility. Whilst endometriosis most often affects the reproductive organs, it is frequently found in the bowel and bladder and has been found in muscles, joints, the lungs and the brain. In a recent Australian government report, endometriosis was reported to cost Australian society over $9 billion annually, with two-thirds of these costs attributed to a loss in productivity and with the remainder, approximately $2.5 billion, being direct healthcare costs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition recognises the devastating impact of this chronic inflammatory condition and its profound effect on health, fertility, education and employment outcomes for women and girls across Australia. The former coalition government was the first government to acknowledge and recognise endometriosis and the impact it has on Australian women. To that end, in 2018, the former coalition government launched the National Action Plan for Endometriosis, a blueprint to improve the treatment, health, understanding and awareness of the condition, with the ultimate aim being to find a cure. The coalition therefore welcomes the Albanese government's decision to uphold the former coalition government's March budget measure to invest over $16 million to establish endometriosis and pelvic pain GP clinics in primary care settings, improving access to diagnostic treatment and other support services for women living with endo. While we commend the government on the implementation of significant initiatives, we will continue to call on the government and hold it to account to implement the coalition's $58 million package in full, including the remaining measures, as well as ongoing support for women experiencing endo.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is vital that women with endometriosis have access to resources to make informed choices about their health and that doctors are provided with clinical guidance to provide the best possible treatment plans. The coalition recognises the importance of Endometriosis Awareness Month, held in March each year, in raising awareness of this painful and debilitating condition. The coalition also recognises the incredible work of organisations like Endometriosis Australia, which play an integral role in supporting patients throughout their endometriosis journey, from diagnosis to treatment and beyond.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The coalition remains profoundly committed to helping to improve the quality of life for the extraordinary number of Australian women and girls living with endometriosis. In that regard, I particularly mention my sister, Jacqui, who has suffered from this debilitating condition for many years.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I rise to speak on the importance of government services, more than ever, in the digital age, and I say at the outset just how impressed I have been from afar, as a southerner from Victoria, by Victor Dominello, the New South Wales Minister for Customer Service and Digital Government. Whenever he would post about a new way of the people of New South Wales interacting with digital services, people would say, 'Why didn't we think of that before?' Whether it was birth certificates or marriage certificates, his focus was always on customer service—that it was easy and that it made sense. So I just want to congratulate him and his team for leading the way in Australia for the last few years, and I wish him and his family the very best.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Whether it be small business owners, students or retirees, constituents in my electorate and, I'm sure, in many others constantly raise concerns regarding their data and how it is managed, and that's a concern that's raised across the community and in all ages, from individuals and families to small businesses. Recent large-scale cyber incidents affecting Optus and Medibank have only further underlined the importance of maintaining safe and secure digital credentials. That is why the Albanese government must prioritise a secure, more simple and more seamless transition across Services Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The government have confirmed their intention to introduce legislation later this year and expand digital identity. The opposition will consider this legislation when it is available and will consult appropriately with the government, the community and private sectors. When in government—and, again, I and the member for Casey weren't part of it, but we are proud Liberals—this side of the chamber launched a major feature to support Australians in accessing the services and payments they needed, including the following: allowing the use of the myGov login to access agency services directly, introducing two-factor authentication through the myGov code generator, and launching the myGov ID.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Prior to the last election, the coalition government introduced an exposure draft for the Trusted Digital Identity Bill as part of the expansion of Australia's digital ID system. The purpose of this bill was a simple one. It was to enable the private sector and governments to participate in the digital ID system whilst also establishing a new consumer safeguards and government arrangements program. There was extensive public consultation about the legislation, but it wasn't able to be enacted in time.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While the coalition welcomes the release of the myGov user audit, which was published in January, the government has still not provided a formal response to the audit despite that being an election commitment. The chair of the myGov user audit, Mr David Thodey AM, and his fellow panel members are to be congratulated on their work. This is in sharp contrast to the government. The review is a vindication of the coalition's digital-first approach to digital service delivery. The audit makes clear that the previous government invested over $200 million in the enhanced myGov program and put in place much-needed building blocks for a better myGov. Whilst this was vital in getting government services to where they are today, the audit made clear that a sustained long-term investment is now required to improve myGov.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the first acts of this government has been to, in effect, abolish the Digital Transformation Agency, which had served as a vehicle to drive digital service delivery under the coalition, and that is disappointing. With around one million logins every day, myGov is indispensable. It is how Australians connect with vital agencies such as Centrelink, the ATO and Medicare. There is an obvious need for government services to become more user friendly, and it shouldn't have to be the case that you need a representative, a family member or—for some—even a lawyer to access digital services.</span>

I am disappointed that in his speech he didn't touch on how this is just another mess that his government—his government—created and that the Albanese government is tasked with cleaning up after that floundering wasted decade. The member for Menzies talked about a vehicle to drive delivery but he didn't mention that the vehicle the Albanese government saw has four flat tyres, no petrol and is unregistered.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Australians were left vulnerable and unprepared for the cybersecurity threats and attacks that we saw last year. That's the reality. That conga line of the Abbott-Morrison-Turnbull governments didn't get it about digital identity and, as a result, about half of the population cannot obtain high levels of identity proofing. The Albanese government—we accept what we were handed—will get on with fixing this. We'll work with the states and territories to allow the use of driver's licences and proof-of-age cards to allow those left out until now to obtain the high level of proof.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I now wish to point out a few inaccuracies in the member for Menzies' motion. For starters, there has been more than one meeting of the data and digital ministers. One was held a month ago in an obscure city called Melbourne, for the benefit for the member of Menzies. I believe that is in Victoria. In attendance were ministers Shorten and Gallagher along with the relevant ministers from Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, Western Australia, South Australia and the Northern Territory. At that meeting, the ministers agreed to actively explore ways to support the National Plan to End Violence Against Women and Children 2022-2032. Ministers will work with the women's safety ministers to identify opportunities to improve data sharing and advance a whole-of-society solution to end gender based violence in one generation.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Again, I point out that the Albanese government believes in working with the states to deliver practical outcomes for Australians. We're not one for hollow photo ops and symbolic stunts. Real change is actually our motto. We'll leave the Liberals and Nationals to fight it out with the Greens, One Nation, and I include the Teals obviously—for those showy stunts!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The next issue I have with this motion is its lauding of the ambitiously titled Trusted Digital Identity Framework. The framework was introduced seven years ago and there is still only the one identity provider. The audit pointed out that the situation is still poor for so many Australians, hardly the glowing endorsement the member for Menzies thinks it is. Currently, many Australians are excluded from setting up a digital identity. Almost half of the citizens of this land don't hold an Australian passport and cannot get a strong digital identity. People without identity documents, such as the 200,000 First Nations people without a birth certificate, cannot set up a standard digital identity. Even more people cannot use it if their identity documents do not match, nor can people who do not have their own mobile device. I'm not sure if the member sees the irony in this, applauding a scheme which fails to assist almost half of the population.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Lastly, the motion calls on the government to urgently legislate on a national identity framework. Wow, they're really reaching peak irony levels here. No wonder we need to act on this, because those opposite failed to do it when in government for that last wasted, wandering decade. Yet the member for Menzies has the gall to complain about a lack of action when inaction was actually the raison d'etre for the conga line of Abbott-Turnbull-Morrison governments.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government will work with the states and territories and get on with the job of progressing to a modern identification system that will assist the vast majority of Australians. That's what this government is all about: getting the jobs done, cleaning up the mess left by those in the previous government.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="300147" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr VIOLI</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Casey</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:10</span>):  The member for Moreton—my good friend, and I do respect him a lot, he's got a lot of ability on the soccer field that's for sure—did just mention the meeting of digital ministers in Melbourne. Melbourne is a great town. It's my home town. Although I note with interest that at that meeting of national digital ministers the two government ministers that attended were the Minister for Social Services and the Minister for Finance, by the member for Moreton's own words, and that in essence is the challenge and the issue that we have. This government does not have a minister for the digital economy. This is something that I've spoken about a lot. This government has a minister for the republic—and I'm not here to make a statement on whether the republic is a good or a bad thing, but it's fascinating that they've got a minister when that's not on the agenda. There isn't a referendum this term, as far as I know. It's all about priorities. This government wants to have a minister for the republic, but, as I said, they won't invest in a minister for the digital economy, and that's why I've continued to call on this government to change and admit that they've made a mistake and put someone in this place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's about improving the digital technology. The myGov app is an example. It delivers productivity gains for all Australians. Out in Casey we're fortunate to have a rich agricultural community. The farmers benefit from having technology—for example, drones to look at their crops. Tradies benefit by being able to do their paperwork electronically and not have to write it out. There are a lot of gains.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Just three days ago, the Productivity Commission made its five-year productivity inquiry report publicly available. This is a vital report. It's over 1,000 pages. It looks at opportunities for increased productivity to drive economic growth. And that report had some interesting things to say about the digital economy. I'm going to repeat a few quotes. I quote here:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">New approaches, such as digital technologies and the better use of data (through artificial intelligence, for example) hold great promise for broadly based productivity gains, including in services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It also states:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… the uplift in online capacity (among both businesses and households) combined with a broader embrace of the innovative potential of digital technology, can transform the way the economy operates—services in particular—with significant productivity benefits.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As our economy continues to evolve, and to feel the impacts of COVID-19, it can increase our digital capacity and it can lead to productivity gains.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I was working in the digital and tech sector when COVID hit. About two weeks into the start of the pandemic our CEO, Ray, based in Toronto, said to us—and he was right—'In the next 10 weeks we will see a transformation in digital that we thought would take 10 years' and that's what has happened. We're at a unique opportunity to take advantage of these opportunities that have come out of COVID. Yet this government has not invested in a minister for the digital economy. Clearly state governments have invested, because this government is holding meetings with those ministers. I can imagine that meeting, where all of the ministers for the digital economy turn up and the Minister for Social Services and the Minister for Finance are there—and that's not a criticism of them, but it's a criticism of Anthony Albanese and the Labor government. They don't understand the significance of this opportunity. You need a minister to set out an overall strategy.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The former government had the 2030 digital strategy. Senator Jane Hume set out those priorities of how we could take advantage of the digital economy but also mitigate some of the threats. We did talk about the cybersecurity threat—and we have seen that through Optus, through Medibank and through Latitude just this week. There are clear risks involved as we transition and continue to transition to the digital economy. But there are great opportunities and the Productivity Commission inquiry have outlined those.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's also why I've also called for the introduction of a technological assessment office, similar to the PBO, so that we as parliamentarians can get support and information about technology, papers on emerging trends, so we can make sure we're at the forefront of what's happening, because the legislation we make in this place impacts what happens. The reality is that the speed at which the digital economy moves, the speed at which technology moves, far outpaces how we work as governments in terms of legislation. A body like a technological assessment office will go some way to closing that gap, allowing us as MPs to have up-to-date information on current technological trends and the impacts that'll have on society.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="300129" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr BURNELL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Spence</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:15</span>):  Just like my friend the member for Moreton, I'd also like to make a contribution to the motion on digital identity moved by the member for Menzies. From my experiences so far with private members' business on Mondays in this place, we often see motions put up by those opposite that require a certain degree of rhetorical gymnastics and, like many good literary works, require the reader or the audience to exercise some suspension of disbelief. Many of the motions put up by those opposite—including, to an extent, the motion by the member for Menzies—start with self-congratulation, saying how good the previous government was. This particular motion notes how great the previous government was for, of all things, myGov. Then we are asked to suspend our disbelief for a moment in the lead-up to a great crescendo: despite how great the previous government was with myGov, why isn't the Albanese government fixing the mess? It is a tried and true format, I must say.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is why I, along with the member for Moreton and others on this side of the chamber, come here on Mondays, to set the record straight. We take a certain degree of umbrage with those opposite in their efforts to be historical revisionists. I can only suspend my disbelief to a certain extent. The member's motion notes there has been only a single meeting of the data and digital ministers since the election of the Albanese Labor government. Given that notice of this motion was given on 7 March, I'm sure the member for Menzies would be delighted to know that the data and digital ministers met an additional time a few weeks prior to that, on 24 February, in Melbourne, with quite a healthy agenda to discuss.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Putting the lie aside for a moment, I'm sure he knows and appreciates this already. But, for the sake of disclosure, I have a great respect for the member for Menzies, as we are co-chairs of the Parliamentary Friends of Veterans, and I do commend the member for Menzies for moving a motion concerning myGov. But digital delivery of government services and digital identity are indeed very important areas of public policy. For millions of Australians myGov is, for better or worse, considered an inevitability of life. It is a platform linking the service delivery platforms of a number of government services, such as the ATO, Centrelink, child support, Medicare and the DVA, to name just a few. Even the stragglers—from those who are a little unfamiliar with using technology all the way to those who proudly call themselves Luddites—saw the intrinsic value in accessing government services through this platform and the necessity to do so during the COVID-19 pandemic, when, as we all well know, face-to-face service delivery was severely hampered and was increasingly unsafe for staff and patrons alike.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">That is why the previous government put their best and brightest on the case. This may very well have been the case, but unfortunately their best and brightest was the member for Fadden. Between events that he would later be discussing before a royal commission concerning robodebt, the member for Fadden had charge of the Digital Transformation Agency. It was where we got such inspirational moments where he blamed hackers—a distributed denial of service, or DDoS, attack—for why myGov crashed nationally at a time when people needed most. Thankfully, an election result brought a halt to the constant trend of the member for Fadden failing upward, and the other Minister for Government Services and Minister for Finance can enact positive reforms to myGov.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the member for Menzies notes, their efforts were described as putting building blocks in place for a better myGov. A school report card would read 'needs improvement'. I guess the magic of it is in the inflection of how you say it. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The other part of the member's motion calls on the government in a very similar fashion to a media release I read from the member for Bradfield upon the release of the myGov user audit. It calls on the Minister for Government Services and the Albanese government to urgently legislate for a national identity framework. It leaves an air of speculation in my bones as to why the Albanese government didn't introduce and pass the Trusted Digital Identity Bill 2021. That's right, in 2021 those opposite were in government. Like many pieces of legislation, the bill didn't lapse when parliament prorogued; the bill died of exposure, sitting there patiently as an exposure draft. I can fondly recall a certain Senator Antic denouncing this bill on <span style="font-style:italic;">The Bolt Report</span> between denouncing whichever ice cream has become woke according to posts he's read on Telegram—the important things that matter in public life.</span>

                  <a href="L6B" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr FLETCHER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bradfield</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Manager of Opposition Business</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:20</span>):  I am very pleased to join with the member for Menzies and the member for Casey in speaking to this important motion. I want to particularly congratulate the member for Menzies for moving this important motion in relation to the myGov user audit and the broader question of digital government service delivery.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The opposition certainly welcomes the release of the myGov user audit led by distinguished Australian David Thodey AO, a former chief executive of Telstra, a former senior executive at IBM and somebody who brings highly relevant perspectives to these issues. The audit makes the compelling case that myGov, Australia's largest digital authenticated platform, is critical national infrastructure. There is no doubt that the cost-of-living crisis presently facing Australians only increases the importance of an efficient delivery of digital government services including through myGov. It is very important, therefore, that this audit not be allowed to gather dust on the bookshelf of the Minister for Government Services—somebody who, throughout his career, has not shown enormous enthusiasm for the whole notion of customer service. In order to realise the objectives of the audit it would be important that the government deliver an appropriate level of both commitment and financial investment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to start by making the point that the reason we have before us as a parliament and as a nation considerable opportunities to improve and enhance the delivery of digital services is because of the foundational work that the previous coalition government did. Indeed the former coalition government had a very strong commitment to digital transformation and to the delivery of digital services. Under our leadership we launched major features of myGov, including allowing the use of the myGov login to access agency services directly, the introduction of two-factor authentication through the myGov code generator, and of course the launch of the myGov ID. These are important abilities which form the very foundation of myGov.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The audit arrives at, in my view, a measured and appropriate assessment of the work done by the previous government, including the investment of over $200 million in the Enhanced myGov program, making the observation that the previous government's program 'put in place much needed building blocks for a better myGov'. When asked during Senate estimates about whether the current government agreed with the assessment made by the audit about the importance of the investment in myGov made by the previous coalition government, the minister representing Minister Shorten said he gave 'credit where credit is due'. I think that is an appropriately high-minded recognition that some things are about politics, and delivering outstanding government services using digital channels ought to be part of that.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am aware that the previous speaker made some comments about digital identity. It is very important that the work done by the previous government in relation to digital identity continues to be built upon. We did release an exposure draft for the Trusted Digital Identity Bill 2021, and the intention of that was to commence a policy process under which myGov ID could be used by state government service delivery agencies and the private sector. Unfortunately we've seen a considerable degree of lethargy, bordering on indolence, from the current government in relation to taking this matter forward.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It was interesting to see that the Productivity Commission, in its magisterial report released on Friday, highlighted the importance of continued progress when it comes to digital identity and the very significant productivity and efficiency benefits that can be achieved through the economy-wide use of digital identity. One of the other significant benefits it would deliver is to greatly reduce the risk of citizens or customers becoming the victims of cyberattacks on large corporates, because it would be possible to establish an account with your bank, with your telco and with your insurance company through the use of your trusted digital identity rather than through providing a wider array of individual identity documents.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The prize is very significant for citizens, and I urge the Albanese Labor government to build on the progress that the previous government was making when it comes to digital identity and digital service delivery.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Fraser</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">13:25</span>):  I've seen firsthand how effective digital government can make a difference in people's lives. When the floods ripped through Maribyrnong in my electorate not long ago, many people's lives were turned upside down and they relied upon timely access to emergency payments from the Commonwealth government. It was through their myGov portal that people were accessing those payments in a timely way. When I was doorknocking and talking to people, I was seeing in real time how people were accessing myGov on their mobile phones, and how within half an hour they saw the government's emergency payments appearing in their bank accounts. So I am one of the members of this place who very much believes in the power of digital government and has seen it work in practice.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This motion, despite the claims of the previous member opposite, is not some kind of high-minded bipartisan attempt to talk about the benefits of a digital government, moving forward. Rather, it is a ridiculous, inaccurate attempt to portray the previous government as having made great progress, and this government not building on their vast legacy. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Context is all-important here. If you look at this motion in a vacuum it might seem to make some kind of sense. But it's a classic example of over-egging the previous government, cherrypicking from a rigorous report and completely misrepresenting what's actually going on. Let's look, for example, at the fact that this motion is based upon cherrypicking one sentence out of this report that says something mildly positive about the previous government. Let's look at finding 10—which they don't put in this motion, strangely enough:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Past failures to adequately address three systemic issues have undermined delivery of high quality, citizen-centric services:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">a. the structure and responsibilities of government do not encourage agencies to join up services for Australians</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">b. myGov has been funded, planned and governed as a standard IT project, instead of essential national infrastructure</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Small">c. 'Fixing myGov' means also fixing things beyond myGov, including the quality of broader government digital, telephone and face-to-face services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The fact that finding 10c refers to the need to fix myGov is exactly where we find ourselves, as in so many other areas of government activity, we're fixing the mess we've inherited from those opposite. So they cherrypick one sentence out of a massive report, and here's just one example of a finding that talks about the previous government's failure to deal with a number of systemic issues. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This motion also calls upon the government to undertake reforms in this area with more urgency. Again, a little bit of context might be relevant here. The digital ID system was initiated by the previous Commonwealth government in 2015. And what we found ourselves facing was a draft bill in October 2021. If people listening to this, and there may not be hordes, want to do the maths on that they'll find that's six years to come up with a draft bill. And might I say, the bill was introduced into parliament right at the point of an election being imminent. Then we came into government with no piece of legislation having been voted on—a vacuum. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Those opposite have this motion calling on urgency from us. They were in government for almost a decade, they identified the issue and they spent over six years coming up with a draft bill. At least they put it into the chamber—unlike the anticorruption bill, which they decided to put out into the community for broader consultation. In 2022, seven years after this issue was first raised, we found ourselves with no bill having been voted on by the previous government. Again, we're dealing with their mess. It is beyond ironic that they would come in here with a motion calling for more urgency after their glacial speed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">They call for the need for greater intergovernmental cooperation. All relevant ministers did meet on 24 February. They did endorse, in principle, the draft national strategy for identity resilience. This is going to complement the developing of a cybersecurity strategy more broadly. When we talk about the need for digital government and for safety, it's worth mentioning that the Minister for Cyber Security, the Hon. Clare O'Neil, was named the 2022 Cybersecurity Person of the Year by Cybercrime Magazine. It is an area in which almost nothing was done for a decade, and now we're taking up the running at warp speed.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think we do to a degree share a concern about digital government across the chamber, but I certainly would not agree with those opposite on their characterisation of their achievements or what's going on right now.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Clark</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">15:59</span>):  Australia's record is shameful when it comes to miscarriages of justice. Indeed, you just have to look at Chamberlain, Keogh, Splatt, Wood, Mallard and Button to see how our criminal justice system can get it so wrong and how, once a wrong is done, it is almost impossible to unpick. No wonder I continue to hold serious concerns about the Tasmanian case of Sue Neill-Fraser, including regarding the conduct of police and forensics. In this case, there are clear doubts about her conviction, including false and misleading evidence about blood, minimised DNA, various non-disclosures, and lost and missing key exhibits. In another disturbing example, the Sofronoff inquiry in Queensland exposed maladministration, inappropriate thresholds preventing the testing of DNA, and a failure of standards and accreditation requirements. And then there is channel 9's investigation, which exposed forensic issues in Keogh's case, which is also alarming.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All states and territories must review their DNA processes, appropriately resource forensic labs and make a serious commitment to provide independent and impartial forensic services. In Tasmania in particular, the forensic services must be taken out of the police department and have its DNA and other processes reviewed—in other words, made independent. Moreover, there is an important role for the federal government to establish a national criminal case review commission, as has been done overseas, where countless convictions found to be unsafe and overturned.</span>

I must say it was a spectacular celebration of our community's diversity and creativity. The call went to community groups, schools, sporting clubs and local organisations to get colourful, get creative and take part in this year's Moruya Mardi Gras and River Lights event and, wow, did they deliver. The highlight of the festival was the huge street parade through the centre of town. The parade was inclusive and it was a joy to see so many people, workers, organisations, dance groups and musicians come together to celebrate our community spirit. The theme for this year's parade was 'yesterday's heroes' with a focus on local characters who have helped shape the town. It was heart-warming to see our community coming together to recognise those people in the past who have helped our community become what it is today. The parade was the beginning of the festivities. There were markets, food stalls, live music and, at sunset, a fireworks show to finish the day.</span>

The Royal Exhibition Building hosted the formal opening of the first parliament of Australia in 1901. Built by Dame Nellie Melba's father over 140 years ago for the Melbourne International Exhibition, the building and its grounds were a place where people came to ride gondolas on the lake, drink beer at the German beer kiosk or take a ride on a rollercoaster. In the early 1900s, during the Spanish flu, the Great Hall was turned into a makeshift hospital where thousands of patients were treated. More than a 100 years later the building was used to combat COVID-19 pandemic, acting as a vaccine hub. The building served as a training base for the RAAF in World War II, and in the 1950s it hosted events for the Melbourne Olympics.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In 2004 the Royal Exhibition Building was the first building in Australia to be awarded UNESCO World Heritage status, even before the Sydney Opera House was internationally recognised. For about 100 years, the Dome Promenade and its 360-degree views were closed to the public. That is why I was thrilled to secure $20 million to conserve, restore and refurbish the building and the dome, which, as of late last year, are now open for tours and events. Thank you to the museum's Victoria team and the local friends of the Royal Exhibition Building and Carlton Gardens group, who worked with such passion to protect this historic and significant building.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Solomon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:03</span>):  It is with great sadness that I learned of the passing of Dr Lily Yulianti from cancer in Melbourne on 10 March 2023. The news shocked many people both here in Australia and in Indonesia. Lily was an Indonesian writer, researcher, literary activist, feminist and the founder of the Makassar International Writers Festival. Both as a journalist and as a researcher, she was very interested in gender and studied the status of women in Indonesian society. She was most recently a postdoctoral fellow at the Monash Indigenous Study Centre in Melbourne. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Lily was excited about her recent documentary on the relations between Aboriginal people of Northern Australia and the Makassar people and was working with our Darwin cultural organisations. She was at the forefront of keeping alive the age-old connection with Makassar through the trading cultures artist exchange. I met Lily at the Darwin Festival last year and was immensely impressed by her intellect, her creative energy and her warmth. Australia and Indonesia have lost a shared teacher in ibu Lily Yulianti. May she rest in peace. Our thoughts and prayers are with her husband and her family.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Mayo</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:04</span>):  Regional print media is a crucial part of our nation's fabric, vital in supporting the wellbeing of our rural communities. Supporting regional print media also ensures media diversity in a highly competitive market, which in turn strengthens the collection and preservation of our local stories. The regional print media industry has endured many challenges over the years. At the beginning of the pandemic close to 200 newspapers across Australia closed and that caused so many shock waves. This event, along with changes to government communications policy between previous and incumbent governments, created a perfect storm in an already challenging media landscape. As such, I call on the government to review communications policy to ensure that our funding for regional print is appropriately considered. News which is focused entirely on local issues facilitates social harmony and ensures that city based news is not oversaturated in the country.</span>

They are all terrific newspapers. They're ensuring that our stories, my community's stories, are told—and have been told for decades. We need to make sure though that regional print media has a future.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bowman</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:07</span>):  I recently had a year 12 student from Redlands College named Ellie Taylor join my office for work experience. She has raised an important, real issue that I'd like to share with you all. Ellie writes: 'In 2011 my family made the decision to move to Australia in search of a better life. Soon after my grandparents followed and settled in Brisbane to spend their retirement. My family has been severely impacted by the current rental crisis. My grandparents, aged 71, have relocated four times as a result of rentals either being sold or rising in value. Each townhouse has been progressively more expensive, forcing them to leave retirement and go back to work to survive. It hurts to see how much stress and pressure this has put on their shoulders. As a single mum, my mother often works overtime to pay our increasing rent. Salaries are staying the same but housing costs are only on the rise. My father has moved back to United Kingdom as he could not afford to live on his own here anymore. I haven't seen him in a year now. Rent prices are breaking up families. This issue goes far deeper than just money. Elderly citizens, single parents, young adults and families are all impacted by this. At this rate my generation will never be able to own their own home or afford to rent. I'm dreading moving out in a region where basic living is becoming unattainable.' I'd like to thank Ellie for the work she has done in my office this last fortnight and for raising this highly important issue. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Canberra</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:09</span>):  Last week I had the great pleasure of visiting the Canberra Innovation Network in my electorate to learn about the work they have been doing to support entrepreneurs and innovators in the Canberra region since their launch in November 2014. It was inspiring to hear about the new ideas that have been fostered by the network, and it brought home again just how much Canberra punches above its weight on business and innovation. With the support of the ACT Labor government and collaboration between Canberra's world-class education and research institutions, including the Australian National University, the University of Canberra, the University of New South Wales Canberra, the Canberra Institute of Technology and the CSIRO, the Canberra Innovation Network is leading the way of connecting entrepreneurs with experts, mentors and founders to develop innovative ideas into start-ups and beyond.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One example of the network's success stories is the award-winning Canberra brewery Capital Brewing Co., which last year became the first brewery in Australia to be fully certified as carbon neutral. I thank the leadership team—Peter, Harlow, Craig and Sharon—for showing me around and for sharing your passion and vision for Canberra as an innovation powerhouse. I'm incredibly proud to be part of an Albanese Labor government that will help the turbocharge enterprise and innovation in medical research, tech and the clean energy sector through our National Reconstruction Fund, a transformational and nation-building investment that will accelerate business and innovation in Canberra and around our nation.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bonner</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:10</span>):  I rise to share the incredible success story of the men's mental health group Men's Walk &amp; Talk. Two years ago, this group was started by Jeff Kruger and Mitch Rowing. Geoff and Mitch were determined to change the way men connected and provided support to each other. Week in and week out, this group meets at Minnippi Parklands and on the bayside to walk, talk and connect. At the beginning of March I, along with over 100 other walkers, joined in celebrating Men's Walk &amp; Talk's 100th walk at Minnippi Parklands—an absolutely incredible achievement. Due to the strong connection these men have, they also just hosted their first ever men's camp retreat.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">We need more groups like Men's Walk &amp; Talk in all our communities. Every day, we lose seven men and two women to suicide. That is why I will always support great initiatives like Men's Walk &amp; Talk, and I can't wait to celebrate with them their 200th walk.</span>

Nowruz embodies the spirit of gratitude for blessings and a hopeful, optimistic outlook for the future.</span>

Many at the event were pleased about the Albanese Labor government's work in delivering a better future for them and their families. When we came to government the Department of Home Affairs had a backlog of over a million visas, which has now been cut down by hundreds of thousands. We have also delivered on our election commitment to grant permanent protection pathways in this country for those on temporary protection and safe haven enterprise visas.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bass</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:13</span>):  Last Saturday I laced up my sneakers and hit the road with around 22 other walkers and a dozen supporters to march in the local Soldier On walk to raise money to support the mental health of veterans. Across Australia, participants are walking 96 kilometres, which is the length of the Kokoda Track, throughout March in the March On Challenge in support of Soldier On. However, we like to do things a little differently in Tasmania, and a local group, known as the Long Patrol, spearheaded by serving ADF member Oliver Breeze, has undertaken the challenge in less than 24 hours, walking from Prospect to Deloraine and back, finishing at the Paterson Barracks.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Having supported the event over the past three years through donations, I missed out on joining the walk last year due to COVID and was eager to join them this year, although, admittedly, I was very naive as to just how tough a 96-kilometre walk would be. I'm proud to say that I managed 47 kilometres, almost 10 hours of walking, before I pulled up stumps and spent the remainder of the time with the volunteer team supporting the walkers who made it back through to Launceston before lunchtime. I'm in awe of the men and women of the Long Patrol team, some of whom have been taking part for a few years now, and I value the conversations we had on the walk.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm thrilled to say that the goal set by the team to fundraise $20,000 has been exceeded with a few weeks left to go and I will hopefully finish my 96 kilometres in the next week or so.</span>

Optus has just announced it will bring forward construction of a telecommunications tower to better support the people of Armstrong Creek and Mount Duneed. I know that for many a lack of connectivity affects their jobs and their access to education and health, and for some it can be the difference between life and death. At our forums I've heard such stories. When an elderly woman's husband collapsed she tried to ring the ambulance, but there was no signal. She ran outside and finally got through. The ambos wanted her to monitor her husband, but she couldn't, because he was inside on the floor and she was outside in the only place where she could get reception.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So reliable, fast mobile services matter. Today I will meet with Optus to acknowledge their commitment. I will also be urging Optus to work with the Geelong council to ensure widespread and effective consultation on the tower's location, and I will continue to advocate for residents right across my electorate. We will soon begin federal funding for the communications tower near St Leonards. We're also rolling out NBN to 30,000 disadvantaged school students. I encourage my students to get on board so that they can get connectivity.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Longman</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:16</span>):  At the 2019 election, I made the election commitment that, if the coalition was elected, we would fund eight chemotherapy chairs at the Caboolture Hospital once the extensions were completed. As we were successful at that election, it was placed in the budget post the election by the then coalition government. That promise, I believe, will still be honoured, as it should be, as the funds have already been allocated. These chairs are critical for the Longman community, as residents requiring treatment now have to drive to either the Sunshine Coast or Brisbane, which means that people with cancer from the towns of Woodford or Bribie in my electorate of Longman have a two-hour return trip to receive the treatment they desperately deserve, which only adds to their high stress levels.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These chairs have still not been delivered and installed, as the much-awaited extension to the Caboolture Hospital has not yet been completed, so I am asking the Queensland state government to consider allocating one or two of the eight chairs to the satellite hospital on Bribie Island. This will be advantageous in two ways. Firstly, it will mean Bribie residents will not have to travel to Caboolture to receive treatment, which will alleviate the load on the Caboolture Hospital. Secondly, it will also assist when the traffic caused by an accident on the Bribie bridge or by congestion on Bribie Island Road causes delay in getting to Caboolture. This vital service needs to be spread amongst the electorate, and I implore the state government to make sure this happens.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Boothby</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:17</span>):  The week of 19 to 26 March is Multiple Birth Awareness Week, and it was great to see the Australian Multiple Birth Association in Parliament House today. While I'm here, I would like to recognise the member for Hughes and the member for Werriwa, who are also twin mothers.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">People often say, 'Oh, I'd love to have twins!' While they can be cute, the reality is that they're hard work, and they can be costly. And I have to say that people rarely say, 'Oh, I'd love to have triplets.' The reality of multiples is that they're often a difficult and high-risk pregnancy and a premature birth, with all the complications that can entail, and with all the potential ongoing medical costs. It often requires early parental leave on the part of the mother. In my case, I went off at 18 weeks due to complications. Then there's the higher likelihood of one parent needing to stay home with the babies due to the cost or availability of child care. And that's not to mention sleep deprivation. Then there's the sheer cost of a rapidly and unexpectedly growing family. Not enough seats in the car means you have to trade up the car. If there are not enough bedrooms in the house, how do you cope? Two, three or more cots, beds, capsules and multiple-birth prams are expensive and difficult to source second-hand, let alone the cost of nappies. And there are fewer hand-me-downs with multiples.</span>

Over the 2022-23 summer season, 54 people have drowned on Australian beaches, with 6,000 rescues being performed by lifesavers and lifeguards between 1 December and the end of February. Several of those were in my own electorate of Fisher. As a father, I know full well just how heartbreaking this is for the friends and families of those lost. As a surf lifesaver for many years, I know how hard these 54 incidents will have struck those on patrol and the first responders involved.</span>

I want to thank those members for their commitment, their courage and their service. I was on patrol yesterday afternoon and was absolutely astounded at the number of people who continue to swim outside the flags. They only needed to walk 100 metres to walk into the flagged area. Much of our time is spent just getting people to swim between the flags. If you go to the beach, please, swim between the flags, if not for your own good, for the people around you.</span>

My family moved into a house in Bull Creek, just down the road from where my electoral office is now. My family and I were so happy to be in Australia, but it was a bit scary. Everything was new, and we had no-one we knew to show us how to navigate Australian life. That's where my dear friend Bruce Baker came in.</span>

They welcomed us as though we were their own family members. Bruce taught me lots of things. He showed me how to clean the swimming pool and mow my lawn. My family even had our first Aussie barbecue in Bruce's house! The food was so simple to prepare, yet so good. I still prefer Bruce's cooked barbecue prawns. They're the best in the west. It has been a joy to remain friends with Bruce after all these years, and my kids still call him 'Uncle Bruce'. Thank you for taking care of us under your wing, Uncle Bruce, and thank you for helping make Australia feel like home. We will never forget your kindness.</span>

I was proud to be joined by my federal colleague the honourable member for Bradfield and shadow minister for the arts, Paul Fletcher.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Pavilion Performing Arts Centre is the revamped Sutherland Entertainment Centre. Most of us who grew up in the shire have either performed at the centre or, in later years, watched our children perform there. The pavilion is the new home of performing arts not only in the Sutherland Shire but in the south of Sydney. It is a state-of-the-art, multipurpose venue with world-class technical facilities and seating for up to 686 patrons. I acknowledge particularly the work of the Sutherland Shire Council, led by our mayor, Carmelo Pesce, and the councillors who had the vision for this project. Then, of course, there is the council staff, led by the CEO, Manjeet Grewal, who actually delivered the project—on time and on budget.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We certainly know how to throw a party in the Sutherland Shire. We had former shire girl Kathy Lette as the MC. Kathy was joined on stage by stars such as Kate Ceberano, Peter Helliar, David Campbell, Jon Stevens and Emma Pask. I offer a huge thank you to all those who have worked so hard to see this amazing facility make its way from the drawing board to reality. It was great to join you to celebrate the fruits of your labour.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Robertson</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:23</span>):  Glenworth Valley Outdoor Adventures is a phenomenal tourist attraction located in the picturesque Glenworth Valley on the Central Coast. Glenworth Valley Outdoor Adventures is known locally, nationally and internationally for its diverse adventure offerings, including horseriding, quad biking, kayaking, abseiling, camping, music events and much, much more.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the business of outdoor adventures for 50 years, Glenworth Valley Outdoor Adventures has become a leading tourist destination. It's the nation's largest horseriding centre and Sydney's best horseriding experience. Visitors get to ride through amazing environments including lush bush area, refreshing rock pools and iconic native bushland. If a more fast-paced experience is what you're looking for, then Glenworth Valley Outdoor Adventures has you covered too. It offers visitors thrilling heart-racing quad-biking experiences through scenic bushlands or on its purpose-built circuit to test your driving skills. The fun-seeking does not stop there. There are kayaking experiences down tranquil river systems or, for a younger audience, laser skirmish activities, which I'm sure are very popular for birthdays and for holidays.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Only a short 60-minute drive from Sydney or a 1½-hour journey from Newcastle, Glenworth Valley Outdoor Adventures is ready to welcome you. I would like to thank all of the employees of Glenworth Valley Outdoor Adventures including its CEO, Craig Ellis, and Barton Lawler, owner of Glenworth Valley group, who oversees the continued success of this great facility.</span>

Ocean Rafting, Big4 Adventure Whitsunday Resort, Wildcat Mackay and Magnums Airlie Beach didn't need to imagine.

A big congratulations to Elizabeth Hackett. Ocean Rafting received a silver award in the adventure tourism category for being the best way to experience our stunning beaches and islands. Congratulations to Peter and Jan Claxton. Big4 Adventure Whitsunday was awarded gold in the caravan and holiday parks category for being the leading adventure resort in the country. Congratulations to Greg McKinnon and his team. Wildcat Mackay also took home gold, in the new tourism business category, for bridging the gap between Mackay and the islands offshore. Congratulations to Asher and Jules Telford.</span>

It was an important day for the warehouse. They received their first fleet of new electric trucks in a partnership with Foton Mobility. The trucks will be on our road, delivering across our community. Companies know that electric vehicles are the future, but businesses need the certainty and a framework to make the transition. That's why the Albanese Labor government is seeking consultation on our National Electric Vehicle Strategy so that business can make this incredibly important transition to zero-emission and hydrogen vehicles. It's great to see companies like this continue to adopt these technologies. It helps build market confidence and demonstrates that the future of transport is electric. It makes environmental and economic sense.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I had a great time checking out the trucks. I even got to drive one—and I did well. The trucks have a similar kilometre-range to the diesel trucks but a longer life and are quieter and easier to drive. Thank you to Massey Wade, Neil Wang, Jeff Morgan, Sean He and Paul Jones for their time and their very warm welcome on the day.</span>

Turning up in towns across Mallee and having a coffee or simply listening to residents' ideas and issues is both enlightening and informative.

It is important to me that I am on the ground in these country towns to hear the issues of local families and businesses directly from those who live there. There are people such as Hopetoun's Lucas and Graeme Puckle, who raised their concerns about hereditary taxes and Labor's new superannuation legislation, and the ramifications for them on their family farm. Gwenyth Barbary and Phillip Jobson from Woomelang gave me an update on the community, the local independent living units and the old, renovated railway station. Sea Lake's Jennifer Simpson and Loris have great ideas for the old Carinya Hostel building for independent living in Sea Lake. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bennelong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:29</span>):  Bennelong is a vibrant and multicultural community that I am proud to represent in this chamber. We're a melting pot of cultures, with people from all corners of the globe calling this beautiful part of our country their home. Sixty-six per cent of families have one or both parents born overseas. So, on any given weekend in Bennelong you can find a cultural celebration somewhere around, and last weekend we had not one but two such celebrations. On Friday afternoon I hosted a celebration of Holi at Wilga Park in Macquarie Park. Holi marks the arrival of spring in the Northern Hemisphere and is the triumph of good over evil. The community gathered together, bringing plates of food to share, and danced and threw coloured powder—and boy oh boy did I get covered in coloured powder!</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The very next day I joined with our local Persian community for their Nowruz festival. Nowruz is the Iranian and Persian new year, and it was a wonderful occasion—music, dancing, food and traditional performances all coming together to create a vibrant and joyous atmosphere. Little Persia in Top Ryde was absolutely packed from 2 pm to 8 pm that evening. It was the first Nowruz celebration in Bennelong supported by the Commonwealth government, and I was proud to deliver that and to be there celebrating with them. Holi on one day, Nowruz the next, with people of all backgrounds celebration together—that's modern-day Australia and modern-day Bennelong, and I love it.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">O'Connor</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:31</span>):  I rise today to celebrate the 50th Wagin Woolorama, recently held in the wheatbelt region of WA. This show reminds us of the massive contribution that farmers make to the Australian economy. In 1972 farmers Malcolm Edwards and Ric McDonald developed a bold plan to rebrand what had been a small agricultural show. Attendance at the first Wagin Woolorama nearly doubled that of the spring ag show that preceded it. The Wagin Woolorama went from strength to strength.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Responding to a downturn in the wool industry at the time, Mr Edwards and Mr McDonald reoriented the focus towards sheep and wool. Fast-forward half a century and sheep producers face another threat—Mr Albanese's planned ban on live sheep exports. The ban—and opposition leader Peter Dutton's attendance at the Woolorama to protest it—were the talk of the show. Alongside a contingent of Liberal parliamentarians, Mr Dutton launched a petition to help save live exports. His visit was the second to my electorate in a month. He also recently visited remote Laverton with me, to support shire president Pat Hill, who had extended an invitation to Mr Albanese that went ignored. Councillor Hill had begged the PM to come to the northern goldfields and see how alcohol-fuelled dysfunction had soared since Labor abolished the cashless debit card. Mr Albanese chose a Kalgoorlie photo op instead. A Peter Dutton led coalition will not ignore the voices of regional Australia.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wills</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:32</span>):  Well, the 2023 AFL season has got off to a cracking start, particularly given that the Magpies have defeated the reigning premiers, Geelong, thumping them at the MCG on Friday night. I'll remind the Deputy Prime Minister of that a little bit later, him being the avid Geelong supporter that he is! But right now I want to speak about an issue that many people in my community care about, and that is the oversaturation of gambling advertising during these sporting events. As a lot of people huddled around the TV or attended stadiums last week, they were smashed with gambling ads all the way through.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Sports embedded gambling ads normalise gambling, especially among young people. Australia's gambling habit puts us at the top of a global list that we don't want to be on. Our losses per capita are amongst the highest in the world. For online gambling alone, Australians spent about $7 billion in 2021. And online gambling has made gambling more convenient and easier to hide. It's been spurred along by the never-ending barrage of gambling ads. In Victoria there were 948 gambling ads on daily free-to-air TV in 2021. That equates to one every 91 seconds, according to the Victorian Responsible Gambling Foundation. I'm particularly concerned about the impact of this advertising on young people, many of whom can tell you the technical aspects of gambling. And I'm concerned for marginalised groups who experience inequality in gambling related harms.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So I'm pleased that the Albanese government is introducing reforms that include nationally consistent messages around the potential harms of online gambling, messages that send a clearer, stronger message about the impacts of gambling and the need for us to curb and reform it. </span>

In my seat of Menzies that figure is 70 per cent, one of the highest in the nation. Melbourne is the largest Greek city outside of Athens, with the suburbs of Bulleen and Templestowe housing a vibrant Greek community. I single out clubs like the Greek senior citizens club of Manningham, the Greek senior citizens club of Saint Haralambos church, and the Bulleen-Templestowe Greek senior citizens club.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So many of our Greek community took a chance on Australia and their future by coming to Australia. Most came by boat many decades ago. They had tears for what was left behind and nerves for what lay ahead. You came here to survive, but you have done so much more; what you did was thrive. You thrived in business, in law, through sport and through the military I served with many Australians of Greek heritage in Afghanistan who were courageous and brave. That is why I was honoured to attend the Greek National Day parade at Albert Park alongside 10,000 other Victorians. There were many distinguished guests, including his Eminence Archbishop Makarios and His Eminence Iezekihl. I single out the children and their parents. We stood on the VIP lectern and watched them come by with their marching and their drums. They were so proud of the school and who they are. Zito Ellada! Zito Australia!</span>

This organisation is one that is extremely special and I am very proud of. I was so pleased to join the minister in announcing a $227,000 grant program for organisations that provide support for people who are new migrants or refugees. Space2b is a warm and vibrant place that is so typical of the wonderful community that I represent. You walk into Space2b and you're presented with products that have all been brought to market by the wonderful new migrants and refugees that are part of the Space2b community. You have all sorts of brilliant art in their gallery, which is in the middle section of their building; and then out the back you have the Flavours of Syria cafe, which has got to be on your list of go-to places when coming to my neck of the woods.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wright</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:37</span>):  I bring the House's attention to a well-written article I read this morning in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Financial Review</span> from Julie Hare, the education editor. The headline is 'Principals deal with abuse and violence every week'. I was taken aback to read:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">School principals are 11 times more likely to be subjected to physical violence than the average Australian, and nearly half have reported being assaulted by parents or students …</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's appalling to have those statistics here in Australia. When I look at the Australian Principal Occupational, Health, Safety and Wellbeing Survey, conducted by the Australian Catholic University, the allegations were absolutely correct. Just on half of principals had reported threats of violence and physical violence against them, and in some cases up to 32 per cent being persecuted by parents. It's an appalling state of affairs.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Isaac Newton said that every action has an equal and opposite reaction. Guess what? If you're a parent and you're going in and you're having a crack at a teacher, 1) they retire earlier; 2) it dissuades the next level of teachers or talent coming through; and 3) the gene pool of talent for our teachers becomes shallower. It's not on. Cut it out, because I've had enough of it.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hasluck</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:39</span>):  I am proudly wearing the display pin sent to me last week by the Australian Men's Shed Association. Men's Sheds, an Australian innovation, celebrated 30 years just last month. From the first shed initiated by Maxine Chaseling at Goolwa at the mouth of the Murray River, there are now 1,297 sheds and countless shedders all across Australia and even a <span style="font-style:italic;">Shed Wireless</span> podcast. Incredibly, there are now more than 2,500 globally too.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The electorate of Hasluck is blessed with six Men's Sheds, in Ellenbrook, Gidgegannup, Kalamunda, Midland, Mundaring and Moorditj Mia at Koongamia. I can tell members that it's best to book early for this year's Christmas lunch at the Midland Men's Shed, because there was the largest Christmas raffle I've ever seen; it took me over an hour to disburse all the prizes. The CWA cooked up an incredible meal and provided some saucy entertainment, so it will be a sellout. The Ellenbrook Men's Shed is so successful that it's now looking to expand. The types of things they create are just gorgeous. I brought the cutest little replica of my campaign trailer and a little four-wheel drive—super cute. At the Kalamunda Men's Shed I got the longest cheeseboard platter using all the beautiful, unique woods of the Perth Hills. My last visit to the Gidgie Men's Shed in January really spoke to the importance of these sheds in a fire affected community. This is an example of bringing community together. I may just learn how to sharpen my chainsaw yet.</span>

It was outstanding evening, listening to some of the coverage of the history of the achievements of the Rotary Club over the past 70 years—there are too many to name in this place today. On 3 March 1953 the Rotary Club of Beenleigh received its charter and became a member of the Rotary International family.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I take this opportunity to acknowledge the tireless efforts and work of John Mulraney, a stalwart of the club over many years, for his terrific job of emceeing the night and going through the history of the club. More recently it's been run under the able tutelage of Janee Hong. John ensured that the Rotary Club of Beenleigh remained an active member of the community for many years leading up to today. It has involved itself in numerous projects, programs and activities. In John's words, numerous members have come and gone from Rotary, but each and every one of those members, past and present, has contributed in some way in shaping how Beenleigh Rotary is today.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many community organisations across our electorates represent the wonderful values we so admire in this great country, and the Beenleigh Rotary Club is just one of those. Congratulations to all involved. I wish you every success for the next 70 years.</span>

Particular thanks to Jason and Kelly from Banana Boogie Bakery in Belair—a bit of a mouthful—where I attended with the local state member, Catherine Hutchesson, the member for Waite, and Premier Peter Malinauskas. The following week we enjoyed the fantastic coffee at Omnivore Cafe in Ascot Park. We then visited Sam and Louise at It Takes a Village—a special shout-out to their staff member Hannah. Mitcham Square Shopping Centre on a busy Saturday morning is also a fantastic experience, and it's lovely to meet with so many people. Last Saturday I was at Marino Community Hall for a farewell before the old hall gets knocked down and redeveloped. Brighton Sunday Market is completely volunteer run—a busy fortnightly market offering fruit and veg, a range of snacks and, most importantly, coffee, as well as second-hand goods, arts and crafts, collectables and a whole range of new items for sale at bargain prices. It's a great community event and a fantastic atmosphere.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's been lovely to chat to Boothby residents about their thoughts, their concerns and their ideas to make Boothby an even better place to live, play, study and work. They talk to me about a whole range of things: cost of living, health care, the upgrade of the Flinders Medical Centre, submarines, cost of cancer treatment—all really valuable. Thank you very much.</span>

I know this firsthand from recently meeting with a number of my school principals. Equally, the teachers cop that in the classroom from the kids and at times also from the parents. As the member for Wright has quite rightly said: 'Enough is enough and it's got to stop.' I had the instance in a discussion with a school principal the other day where this school principal had to suspend a child in grade 2 for vaping, and the abuse that this principal copped from the parents about suspending the child was just outrageous, and completely and utterly uncalled for. </span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the great organisations in our community is yourtown, an organisation which, since 1961, has been helping young people realise they have the ability to tackle whatever life throws at them. With services including Kids Helpline, Parentline, domestic and family violence support, mental health support and employment support, yourtown understands that every young person in Australia deserves a safe place to be, where they are respected and free to be themselves without judgement. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In particular, yourtown has been providing free professional counselling and support 24 hours a day, seven days a week for children and young people aged five to 25 in Australia through its Kids Helpline service since its inception in 1991. Kids Helpline's provision of professional and free counselling support ensures equality for all children and young people regardless of their location or their circumstances. In fact, Kids Helpline is the only service of its kind in Australia which is free to all children and young people. They describe themselves as being the national wellbeing and mental health safety net for children and young people, which I find quite an apt description. This statement is further cemented when you delve into their facts and figures. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Over its 32-year history, Kids Helpline has responded to over 8.6 million calls from children and young people. Unfortunately, as I'm sure we all know in this place, these calls have only increased in frequency over recent years. Lockdowns over the past few years have exacerbated communication and social issues for young people. The impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of young Australians is evident through the increased demand for support, with Kids Helpline experiencing a significant surge in calls. In the 2021-22 financial year, over 443,000 contacts were made with Kids Helpline. Every 71 seconds, a young person reaches out to Kids Helpline for support. Sadly, just one in three calls can be answered. More than 50 per cent of these callers now require counselling, when they were previously referred on to external supports. This is first-time counselling calls that have been the predominant form of calling throughout Kids Helpline's entire history—an astonishing statistic.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As with many other health and wellbeing networks, Kids Helpline has established a number of virtual assistance resources which include not only their counselling and crisis support services and ongoing case management but, importantly, peer-to-peer support, early intervention sessions with schools, self-help resources through their website and the 'niggle' app. These online resources have proved to be invaluable, particularly as a result of the pandemic. Yourtown CEO Tracy Adams and her team have clearly made and continue to make incredible progress in addressing the mental health needs of children and young people who contact Kids Helpline in trying circumstances. However, to meet this demand and the expected increases in the future, yourtown needs further support.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The previous coalition government provided $26.8 million to Kids Helpline in 2021, including an immediate $2.8 million to deal with the impacts of the pandemic as part of our broader commitment to mental health. Since then, demand for this service has continued to rise. That is why today I'm calling on the federal government to step up and assist yourtown in supporting the further growth of the Kids Helpline services in order to meet the ever-increasing demand for support. Such a commitment is vital to ensuring that children and young people have someone to support them in times of deep stress. With calls at record highs, there are still too many young people who are unaware of the services Kids Helpline provides and who are, sadly, missing out on highly beneficial help and guidance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I want to encourage all members and senators in this parliament to continue to raise awareness of the important services available to young people 24/7 through Kids Helpline. They can reach the service by calling 1800 551 800 or online at kidshelpline.com.au. For everyone watching or listening, I encourage you all to donate and assist yourtown in their fundraising efforts. You can do so by visiting yourtown.com.au. Thank you to everyone at Kids Helpline for the tremendous work you do for our community.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="265979" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Dr FREELANDER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Macarthur</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:51</span>):  I'd like to thank the member for Forde for bringing this motion to the House. It's a very important issue and one that I think we need to highlight much more than we have in the last few years. As a paediatrician I've seen many patients struggle with mental health and I've seen the impact this has had not only on them but on their families. The pandemic certainly increased the number of presentations of even quite young children with mental health issues, and I'm not sure that we really have the answers to deal with that. I think there's still a lot of anxiety in the paediatric population about their world, not just because of the pandemic.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I think the social determinants of health are incredibly important in this. I continue to see children who are homeless or have unstable living conditions, and I'm not convinced that any of the policies that have been presented by the major parties have the answer to our housing difficulties. Imagine a child—even a relatively young child—who has to move house all the time. When they move house, often they also have to move school. If they have learning problems, other learning issues or health issues, they have to re-establish those links in their school, maybe even with a new doctor, a new paediatrician and a new hospital. It just adds to the stress these kids are facing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Kids Helpline has been a really great service over many years—for over 30 years, in fact—providing some support to those kids. It's open 24 hours a day. The counsellors are very well trained and usually tertiary qualified. Many young people and many families turn to Kids Helpline for assistance. Sometimes it's for advice about how to manage their kids. Sometimes for the kids themselves it's about having an independent person they can talk to about their feelings, issues they're having at school or issues they may be worried about in their own families. I'd certainly like to thank the Kids Helpline counsellors and our other mental health teams in my local area of Macarthur, like the Macarthur Child and Adolescent Mental Health Service, Lifeline Macarthur and a whole range of different services that are providing support to our kids. But I stress that there are many important issues we need to address if we are going to support our kids.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm distressed by the difficulties our public school system is having in accessing help for kids with learning problems. That has been an ongoing issue over many years. It's reflected, unfortunately, in the postcode data and in the private and public school data for the most recent HSC. Overwhelmingly, kids in wealthier areas or kids who go to private schools have, as a cohort, average better results than those in the public school system, particularly in more disadvantaged areas. That is wrong. It is inequitable, and we have to change it. I see time and time again kids without any knowledge of where they'll be sleeping in the next week, I see parents with drug and alcohol problems unable to access rehabilitation and support for themselves, and it really is difficult for schools to support these kids in those sorts of unstable environments.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The social determinants of health are incredibly important. We must fund the Kids Helpline. The Albanese government has also recently developed the concept of kids hubs around multiple different areas, particularly disadvantaged areas, which will provide ongoing mental health and wellbeing services for children between the ages of zero and 12 years and for their families. These hubs will operate as secondary-level child mental health support and they will help. Additionally, I welcome the announcement made last month by the Minister for Education that $203 million will be provided for the Student Wellbeing Boost, $192 million of which will be provided in funding to every school to support their students' mental health and wellbeing, with schools on average receiving over $20,000 for the 2023 education year. There is also $10.8 million that will be provided for launching a mental health check tool to help schools ensure students whom they are concerned about get the support they need.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">But I would stress once again at the end of my speech that it's those social determinants of health that are really important, and I don't believe that, at this stage, either the coalition or the Labor government is adequately addressing those issues.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lindsay</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">16:56</span>):  I thank the member for Forde for his motion. I know how deeply he cares about the community in Queensland that he serves, in particular the young people, by bringing this motion to the House today. Vital services for young people like Kids Helpline really do matter, especially as we combat a mental health crisis in this country. As the shadow assistant minister for mental health and suicide prevention, I acutely feel a responsibility to address this crisis when I see the challenges that our local community faces, in particular our young people. I see the impact of lockdowns and of not being able to attend schools. A once-in-a-century pandemic has taken away loved ones, separated families and dramatically shaped the formative years of students. Western Sydney also battled floods and fires and had livelihoods washed away. The trauma is left behind and does linger. There have been cost-of-living pressures as well, and these are being faced by our young people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Whilst engaging with mental health and suicide prevention stakeholders, I've been quite troubled by the struggles that young Australians are facing today. In the 2021-22 financial year, Kids Helpline was contacted directly by over 443,000 children and young people aged between five and 25 from across Australia, with millions more using resources and content across multiple channels. It is clear that the COVID-19 pandemic has exacerbated social issues for young people, and psychologists that I've spoken with have warned that a tsunami is on the horizon, as it takes years for the mental health impacts of big events to start coming through. For the first time in its over-30-year history, more than half of callers now require counselling, where previously they were referred on to external supports. These statistics marry up with the sense we all have that the times we live in are much more difficult. Each hardship varies and each story is different, but each person is also different, and any one of us who has been in an electorate office knows that the people who present through the doors are often dealing with quite significant issues, and more and more I'm seeing people present through my election office in Penrith with mental health issues, or having a loved one experiencing this. There are huge workforce issues that begin with the education and training pipeline and flow through to the distribution and retention of the workforce across our population, including inner and outer metro areas, such as those in Western Sydney, and most definitely in regional communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We all have a collective responsibility to do more to ease that burden that's being faced in particular by young kids right now not only by paving an easier path to accessing support but also by making sure that the support is available for those who need it. We will, unfortunately, never truly know the full social cost of mental illness, but we do know to some extent the economic costs of poor mental health. The Impact Economics and Policy report commissioned by NSW Council of Social Service looked at the compounding impacts of repeated natural disasters and the pandemic on the mental health of the population. The report found that rates of depression and anxiety had increased in recent years, with young people some of the worst affected. This includes an almost 50 per cent increase, from 2018 to 2021, in the number of teenage girls presenting for self-harm or suicidal thoughts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">For those privileged to serve in positions of leadership, I invite all of us to ask what can we do to address this very important issue that is not going away; it is only growing, especially for those without the proper support networks that many of us have. I call upon all members of parliament to continue to raise awareness of the important services available to young people through the Kids Helpline 24/7 by calling 1800551800 or online through kidshelpline.com.au. I also call on the Albanese government to support further growth in the Kids Helpline services to meet the sad, ever-increasing demand for support being experienced by children right across our country.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Hunter</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:00</span>):  Mental health is one of the defining challenges of our generation and it is an issue that we are seeing is common among our young people. Over 75 per cent of mental health problems occur before the age of 25; 13.9 per cent of children and young people aged four to 17 years met the criteria for diagnosis of a mental disorder in the last 12 months; and, sadly, suicide continues to be the leading cause of death amongst young people. These statistics show that we have a long way to go in this country when it comes to protecting the mental health of young people. They've demonstrated why it's so important, especially in the modern day, that our young people have support services available to them to go to when they need them most.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Unfortunately, in the Hunter there is a serious lack of any support services for young people who are struggling with their mental health issues. And the limited services that we have are inadequate and find it difficult to keep up with the demand. The issue of lack of physical support services is even more severe in the more rural areas of the Hunter like Singleton, Muswellbrook and Denman. This makes services like the Kids Helpline absolutely vital. Yourtown, through the Kids Helpline, has been providing free professional counselling and support 24/7 for children and young people aged five to 25 in Australia for 30 years. This free and accessible service is absolutely invaluable in electorates like mine where young people who need the support are experiencing a lack of face-to-face services in their area.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Yourtown is a long-running organisation in Australia which has been providing critical services for young people. They not only to deal with mental health support, but also focus on long-term unemployment, child protection, as well as support for those experiencing domestic and family violence. Kids Helpline counsellors are tertiary qualified and trained to work with young people across a range of issues and presentations. The benefits of the professional counselling service in particular are huge. Just in the 2021-22 financial year Kids Helpline was contacted directly by over 443,000 children and young people from across Australia and millions more made the most of other services made available by Kids Helpline, including their online services.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The amount of lives that these services will have changed, and in some cases saved, will be countless. We are so lucky, especially in the Hunter, that these services are free and accessible to us. But it is clear that mental health has become an even bigger issue for young people of Australia, especially following the pandemic, with the Kids Helpline experiencing a significant surge in calls for support during the lockdowns. Over 50 per cent of callers are requiring counselling. This is the first time this has been the case in the 30 year history of Kids Helpline. As a result, a high demand for the Kids Helpline services now exceed capacity. This means that there are even more barriers to young people, like those in the Hunter, who already find it hard enough to get the support they need. However, going without this support when you need it is not an option.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As members of parliament, we are in the position of being able to raise awareness of the available support services. And it is our responsibility as members of parliament to make sure that this support continues to be available to each and every person who needs it. So I would like to say to the young people in the Hunter: if you are going through a hard time, if you're struggling with something, support is there for you. Don't be afraid to reach out and ask for help. Make the most of the 24/7 Kids Helpline by calling 1800551800 or by going online through kidshelpline.com.au. Looking after the youngest members of our community ensures a bright future for the Hunter electorate. I thank the Kids Helpline for the wonderful work they do to provide much-needed support for young people of the Hunter and also to the young people of Australia. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Casey</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:05</span>):  Kids Helpline provides a vital service for youth mental health of all Australians but this is especially so for rural and regional areas like my electorate of Casey, where a town like Warburton is a good 40-minute drive, and even longer on public transport, for young people who need a specialised service. Kids Helpline is the only free professional and confidential 24/7 online and phone counselling service that specialises in providing support to all young people aged between five and 25. We saw during COVID and its lockdowns how much this service was needed and how vital it was in helping young people all across the country. Kids Helpline is a trusted provider of services for young people with a focus on mental health and wellbeing, long-term unemployment, prevention of youth suicide, child protection, as well as support for those experiencing family and domestic violence. Kids Helpline is the critical safety net for children and young people needing mental health support and is often the only mental health service available after hours, or for those living in rural and remote areas. Kids Helpline's provision of professional free counselling support ensures equality for children and young people, regardless of their location or circumstance.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I had the opportunity just last week to speak to Kathryn and Marion from Kids Helpline. They outlined some of the stories and people who have been impacted. What is so important about this service is that it is available to those who need it, no questions asked. It is a safe place for young people.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To continue their work, Kids Helpline has really big plans for the future of but they also need support from us. I know this is a bipartisan motion and it's great to see. A phone centre in Brisbane was impacted by the floods last year and that has had a significant impact on their operation. They have some exciting plans around investing in digital technology to improve their service and allow the service to scale to another level. I urge us to support them in any way we can in this House because during the financial year 2021 to 2022, Kids Helpline was contacted over 443,000 times and 156,000 of these were responded to, so there is more demand than they are able to look after at this time. They enacted 5,753 emergency responses. To understand, they are emergency responses where particularly young people are experiencing a crisis such as a suicide attempt, child abuse or sexual assault. The counsellors literally stay on the line while they call emergency services, and 5,753 times the counsellors were able to support those in direct crisis. The reason why we need to continue to support them is there were almost 300,000 calls not answered. It is tragic to think that within that 300,000 there would have been many more who needed that emergency response. That's why I'll always continue to advocate in this House for support for youth mental health services, particularly Kids Helpline and the amazing work they do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate of Casey, we recently had a very successful youth mental health service but the Lilydale Youth Club closed its doors in December last year and it was a severe blow to our local community. I'd like to take a moment to mention some of the key groups that were involved in establishing the youth hub: Sue Sestan at Inspiro; Anchor, CIRE Services; Oonah Health and Community Aboriginal Corporation; the Eastern Community Legal Centre; and the Yarra Ranges Council, which did amazing work establishing the youth hub. I know they're continuing to work to see what options there are for the hub. I'll support them in any way I can. They collectively advocate for the health and wellbeing needs of young people in the Yarra Ranges and Casey. Our community knows the complex needs of young people and their families in this region. It can't be met by headspace alone, which, again, is already oversubscribed. That's why our advocacy in this place is so important.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We also know that our young people need to have somewhere safe and welcoming to spend their time so that their needs don't escalate into costly therapeutic interventions. It's times like these that Kids Helpline can assist. We are thankful for their invaluable service and commitment to youth mental health. I'll continue to advocate for services like the Lilydale Youth Hub and Kids Helpline, which help our community and their families. For those kids, I want to let you know that Kids Helpline is available 24/7 by calling 1800 55 1800 or online through kidshelpline.com.au.</span>

I thank the member for Forde for bringing this motion forward. As the member for Casey mentioned earlier, this very much has bipartisan support. yourtown, which operates the helpline, does a magnificent job of being a reliable ear and a voice for young people struggling with mental health issues or anxiety. It's crucial that our young can contact a tertiary qualified and trained counsellor for help and advice both online and on the phone 24/7. Many of these children may be in a situation where they can't access the services they require because of where they live and/or who they live with. They may live in a household where a parent or caregiver may not be as open to them seeking help. Sadly, as we know, most harm will be visited by those who claim to love us the most, so being able to access this independent service is so important.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's changed a lot since it started way back in 1981, from being a telephone access service to now offering webchat, My Circle, a social platform for kids aged 13 to 25 to access to talk to peers, and other opportunities to access materials through online and social media. It's moving with the times. Back in 1991, who would have thought that bullying would move online? Bullies are now in your bedroom. Back in 1991, Troll was just a bad movie, or they were something that lived under bridges in fairytales. Who would have considered the added pressures that young people have to deal with today, like NAPLAN—although my son, who just did NAPLAN, didn't seem as worried as I would have hoped he'd be—social media, helicopter parents, the digital world and climate change? It can feel endless. </span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While Kids Helpline does an amazing job, it is important that we continue to invest in young people's mental health. I was pleased to see the Minister for Education, Jason Clare, and the Assistant Minister for Mental Health and Suicide Prevention, Emma McBride, recently announce a student wellbeing boost of $203 million of funding for a new voluntary mental health check to enable schools to ensure that vulnerable students get early help when needed. There is also $192 million, as an additional one-off funding, for every school to support their students' mental health and wellbeing coming out of the COVID crisis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are also a variety of different supports from the federal government for young people, including the Smiling Mind Schools Program, the National Workforce Centre for Child Mental Health initiative, the Be You education initiative delivered by Beyond Blue and the Head to Health Kids Hubs. We need each state to make sure of the availability of quality wraparound mental health services. I know that teachers and staff at local schools are often at the coalface when dealing with mental health issues with children. They do this despite the increasing workload issues facing our modern schools.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Recently, I was at a loading dock at a retail store in my electorate after buying a new television for my dad when a former student handed me my order. He saw my name and we started chatting. It was funny. I didn't remember the kid well, but he said, 'Thank you for providing a safe space for me.' It was one of the nicest things I've ever heard. I know that teachers, principals and staff all around Australia are providing safe places in a chaotic world every single day in our schools. Often they are the first to notice issues and refer them to specialised care either through the education department or through the state health system. I want to make a special shout-out to all of the 50 schools in the Moreton electorate for the great job the staff, the principals and the other support workers do at the frontline in terms of dealing with kids dealing with family issues and mental health issues—obviously not just the Moreton schools; all schools around Australia.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">To close out, I'd also like to thank everyone who donates to Kids Helpline. To all those counsellors, I want you to know that you're appreciated for the job that you do in helping out young people. My friend Kylie, my wife's best friend, used to be a counsellor at the Brisbane office and has now gone on to work in full-time child protection work. Certainly Kids Helpline was good preparation. Thank you for all the amazing work that you do and will continue to do.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="282981" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms BELL</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Moncrieff</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:15</span>):  Suicide continues to be the leading cause of death for young Australians. Last year, 402 young Australian lives were lost to suicide. Half of all the mental health conditions we experience at some point in our lives will have started by age 14, and over 75 per cent of mental health problems occur before the age of 25. It's very sobering. One in 10 young people aged 12 to 17 will self-harm. One in 13 will seriously consider a suicide attempt. One in 40 will attempt suicide.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is hope though. There are organisations across the country that provide free help and support to Australians who need it most. For more than 30 years yourtown's Kids Helpline has been one of those organisations, providing counselling, guidance and support 24 hours a day, seven days a week. For many young people, Kids Helpline has saved their life. It has been someone to talk to when there was no-one else to talk to, someone to listen to when there was no-one else who would understand, and something to support when you had all but given up.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Kids Helpline continues to play an integral role in our mental health system not only due to its role in supporting Australians aged five to 25 but also due to the ease of accessibility, particularly for those living in rural, regional and remote Australia. Before we had computers in our pocket, young people could access support from Kids Helpline through a phone, home mobile or even a payphone. You didn't need to see a doctor or need a reference; you could just dial 1800551800 and there would be someone on the other end of the phone to talk to. Then, as technology advanced, so too did Kids Helpline, who launched their online platform, making it easier for young people to seek the support they need.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The incredible work undertaken by Kids Helpline and many other mental health organisations was crucial during the pandemic. While we worried about the economy, the spread of the virus and preventing mass unemployment and death, children and young people were sometimes forgotten. Sure, they could still go to school from home, but many of them were not able to see their friends and continue their social development. And, for some, their home life deteriorated, something they weren't able to escape, due to the lockdowns. Having a service like Kids Helpline meant they could still seek support from the privacy of their phone or their computer. In the 2021-22 financial year over 443,000 children and young people across Australia contacted Kids Helpline. I want to take a moment to thank each and every person who currently works at Kids Helpline or has ever worked there. The work you do is changing lives across our country and is saving lives across our country. We won't know the full extent of the impact the COVID-19 pandemic has had on our children and young people, but we know that with organisations like Kids Helpline there'll always be someone to talk to if they need it. Providing early support is vital to help children and young people get back on track and to minimise long-term impacts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I also want to mention the work of the previous coalition government and the funding that we provided to Kids Helpline to help them continue with their crucial work. In 2021 we provided yourtown's Kids Helpline with a $26.8 million investment to continue its support for the mental health and wellbeing of children and young Australians. Under the coalition, funding for mental health and suicide prevention services increased to a record $6.8 billion in 2022 and 2023, more than double what it was in 2012-13. We are committed to making mental health and suicide prevention a national priority and delivering better outcomes for all Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm disappointed that in less than 12 months of being in government Labor have already slashed mental health services, reducing the number of psychologist sessions annually under Medicare from 20 to 10. This is disgraceful. But we shouldn't expect anything less from a government that sells lies and half-truths to get elected, given they cut mental health funding the last time they were in government and they've done it again. I call on the Albanese government to do more in the mental health space, including providing funding to Kids Helpline and similar organisations to ensure our children and young people are not left behind. 402 lives lost is 402 too many. We need to do more to support young Australians, who are the future of our country. I want to again thank the life-saving work of Kids Helpline and the many other organisations that also support our children and young people across Australia.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Solomon</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:20</span>):  I rise to speak to an incredibly important resource for some of our most vulnerable young kids, and that is of course the Kids Helpline. This is a service offered by the charity yourtown, which has been providing vital services for young people across Australia since 1961. It is focused on mental health and wellbeing, long-term unemployment, the prevention of youth suicide, child protection and support for those experiencing domestic and family violence. For over 30 years, yourtown has been providing its free professional counselling and support 24 hours a day, seven days a week, for children and young people aged five to 25. Kids Helpline is a critical safety net for young people needing mental health support and is often the only service available after hours for those living in rural and remote areas. It provides professional, free counselling support that ensures equality for all children and young people, regardless of their location or circumstances. In the 2021-22 financial year, Kids Helpline was contacted by over 443,000 children and young people from across Australia. Millions more use resources and content across its multiple channels, including the great Kids Helpline website.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the young people using the website was Georgia, aged 13, who went through a tough time when her parents divorced. Georgia said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">My parents divorced and it changed my life, and not for the better. I was forced to stay at my dad's house. He was never there. It hurt because he just couldn't be bothered with me. I failed nearly all my assessment pieces, all I felt was stress, stress, stress!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, Georgia found the Kids Helpline website. She said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">… I realised that I'm not the only person suffering. I realised that there are people out there willing to help me. Thanks to Kids Helpline, I'm smiling heaps more than I used to!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Or take the story of Caitlyn, aged 15, who recounts being diagnosed with depression and anxiety disorder:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Many more months and attempts on my life later, I was at my lowest point. This is when I made a more serious attempt on my life, which was traumatic for everyone involved.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">But therapy and friends and family assisted her recovery. She said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">Even though I am still struggling a lot with my feelings and thoughts, I wanted to say that, no matter what you are going through you deserve help, you deserve love and you're worth it.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Angus, aged 20, used the helpline when he was 16, after fighting with his parents all the time. He felt that they wouldn't listen to him, and one day he came home to find his belongings at the door and the door locked. He struggled to find a place to stay, and his grades at school slipped. Angus later said:</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Small" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;&#xA;          text-indent:0pt;&#xA;        ">
                <span class="HPS-Small">I talked to a really nice counsellor from Kids Helpline who supported me when things were really bad. I've also been able to work things out with my parents and we get along much better now. We still live apart but it's much better than it was.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These brave young people are only three of the millions helped by Kids Helpline and its website. This is an essential service that was strained by the lockdowns we had during the pandemic. For the first time in its over-30-year history, more than 50 per cent of callers now require counselling. Regrettably, demand is now so high that it exceeds capacity. I think all members would agree that Kids Helpline is a vital service that we should all support in this place. I'm proud that the Commonwealth government funds yourtown to deliver Kids Helpline.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I've got young children, like many people in this place. We hate to think of them being unsupported. They are our future. Today's world is so complex and complicated for them. It's great that there is a service, Kids Helpline, that they can reach out to. It might be not our kids; it might be some of our kids' friends, it could be anyone—any young Australian that is in need of this support, and I'm glad that it's there when our young Australians need it.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Everyday Australians have shown again and again their dismay in relation to plastic waste and their preparedness to support the change that is required. It is not principally individuals and households that need to fix this problem; it is companies and it is government. Unfortunately, we haven't made great progress on that front. In aggregate terms, our consumption of plastic hasn't greatly reduced and our recycling and reuse of plastic hasn't greatly improved. Yes, we have made some welcome progress in relation to single-use plastic, and we should celebrate that. We should remember that when people claim it's impossible to shift away from this or that form of plastic, the same thing was said about eliminating plastic cutlery, straws, cups and so on. But in terms of the big picture, there hasn't been much change,.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The REDcycle debacle is a reminder of how we need to be absolutely rigorous in demanding that change occur, that we measure it, and that we hold those responsible to account. I don't understand how that scheme ran for years without anyone knowing that the collection of soft plastics for recycling was not resulting in any actual recycling. The Woolworths 2022 sustainability report says:</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">In F22 REDcycle recycled 4,608 tonnes of plastic through Woolworths Supermarkets across Australia, a 58% growth on previous year.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Small">Since the REDcycle program began, more than 2.4 billion pieces (9,675 tonnes) of flexible plastic have been returned to our supermarkets across Australia. The soft plastic is converted into a range of products including playground furniture, supermarket trolleys, fence posts and as a base for roads.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">But in reality, since 2018 more than 12,000 tonnes of soft plastic has been stockpiled. It hadn't been converted into anything other than warehouses full of plastic that presented a fire risk.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The former coalition government lauded the REDcycle program at every opportunity, including at their much vaunted Plastics Summit in 2020. Like so many of their supported initiatives, there wasn't much substance; just lots of packaging. As far as I'm concerned, there are still serious questions to answer in relation to how the supermarkets and the former government remained in the dark about what can only be described as an abject failure. Australians diligently collected and dropped off their soft plastics and they were told it was being recycled. At the same time, the coalition spent millions of taxpayer dollars running ads to that effect. But in reality, for years the REDcycle arrangement was a charade.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The environment minister, the member for Sydney, has been resolute about these matters and about the scale of the challenge. Under the minister's leadership, this government has allocated $60 million to tackle hard-to-recycle materials like soft plastic, and we have established a national task force on the circular economy. The minister has rightly said that in the face of failed voluntary schemes with respect to product stewardship, there will come a time when co-regulatory or mandatory schemes with proper reporting and compliance will need to be applied.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've seen the Australian Packaging Covenant drift along without delivering any meaningful change in key areas like the use of recycled plastic and new packaging. The 2025 APCO target is to achieve a relatively modest 20 per cent of recycled plastic in new packaging by that date. Yet the current level has been stuck at two to three per cent for years. One of the many reports the previous government kept stonily silent about was the consultant review at the end of 2021 that made it patently clear that the APCO targets were badly off track and would not be met.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We want to make serious progress towards a circular economy, which we must achieve if we want to stop the scourge of ocean plastic and ensure our sustainable use of limited resources. To do this we need effective market design, effective regulation and serious corporate social responsibility. Australia has been crystal clear about what they expect and they've shown and keep showing their preparedness to take action and make choices in the name of avoiding waste, stopping environmental damage like plasticosis and building a sustainable, resilient circular economy. The Albanese Labor government is not going to shirk our responsibly on that front.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Warringah</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:30</span>):  I thank the member for Fremantle for this important motion. Soft plastic recycling is a significant issue in Australia, as traditional recycling methods do not work on these materials and they can take hundreds of years to break down in landfill, causing serious environmental harm. Australia currently consumes more single-use plastic waste per person than any other country in the world after only Singapore. That is something that I think Australians just don't realise. Despite awareness, we are not good worldwide citizens on plastics.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Consumption of plastic is rising, and we recover less than 15 per cent of the plastic used in our country. Plastic pollution is the single biggest threat to marine biodiversity. That said, until the collapse of REDcycle, Woolworths had seen an increase in soft plastic returns, growing at some 70 per cent per year. So, there was a willingness but really not an awareness of how badly we were doing. Individuals were starting to do their bit, but only 16 per cent of plastic packaging was recycled or composted in Australia between 2019 and 2020. The national packaging target is for 70 per cent of plastic packaging to be recycled or composted by 2025, but we are way off that target, and it shows that a voluntary system is simply not working.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Ninety-nine per cent of plastic is made by using fossil fuels, like fracked gas and oil, and it is dangerous to people and the environment throughout its entire life cycle. REDcycle was a well-known soft plastic recycling initiative in Australia but then declared bankruptcy, catching all unaware and leaving a huge gap in this circular system. A new soft plastics task force has been established to develop a new approach to soft plastic recycling in Australia with some urgency. I recently met with representatives from Woolworths and was heartened in relation to their commitment to solving this issue and stepping into the gap that has been left by REDcycle. The task force is a collaboration of leading brands, government bodies and industry groups aiming to create a more sustainable future for soft plastics in Australia. It's quite frightening to think about the extent to which all these players were simply in the dark as to how badly REDcycle was operating.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The soft plastics task force will focus on education, innovation and collaboration to address the challenges of soft plastic recycling. It aims to develop new recycling technologies and solutions, such as using soft plastics in road infrastructure and other construction projects. The aim is to introduce in-store collection pilot programs and kerbside collection programs. But we need to recognise that government needs to have a priority when it comes to its procurement—that in fact we are prioritising the use of recycled plastics. We know the task force is severely constrained, but it shows lack of access to soft plastic recycling, which can process the mixed polymer soft plastics that they aim to collect.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Currently it's impossible to recycle the volume of household soft plastics collected in the proposed programs by using the current infrastructure. However, over the next year the task force plans to align their collection program with projected opening of new recycling operators and expansion of existing processors. The task force also aims to raise awareness about the importance of soft plastic recycling and the devastating impacts of single-use plastics on our environment. There are some solutions but they require political will. Soft plastic recycling reduces waste, conserves natural resources and prevents pollution. Consumers want to know that the plastics they put in recycling bins and at collection sites is actually being recycled to ensure this continued investment and expansion of the recycling industry remains paramount. We need to ensure the circular economy works, where waste is designed out, materials are kept in the economy for as long as possible, and where residual waste is reduced and safely managed in a safe and sustainable alternative to the constant reintroduction of virgin plastics we see in Australia. That is why I strongly support that we introduce an import tax when it comes to any manufacturing or selling of any virgin plastics. We need to get away from new plastics constantly coming into the system. As I said, government procurement contracts must mandate a proportion of recycled content; that would be a large lever. We have to create that market for recycled contents. And product stewardship schemes can be imposed to increase the responsibility of businesses for the waste they produce.</span>

The reality is we have a plastics problem in Australia. We produce too much and we don't reuse what we already have. If we don't act, we face a future where plastic will outweigh fish in our oceans by the year 2050. If we don't act, we will see more videos of dead turtles and dead sea that having their stomachs cut open to reveal a rainbow of micro plastics—animals that have either starved to death or choked on plastic. If we don't act, we will continue to see the average Australian ingest a credit card's worth of micro plastics each week. It is for horrific reasons like these that the people of my electorate want to reduce waste and use fewer disposable items in the first place. But we have to set up our economy to help them to do so.</span>

I thank him for bringing this important issue to the chamber. The motion outlines what the Albanese government is doing to address the woeful state of soft plastic recycling after a decade of inaction by the former coalition government. The cornerstone of the Albanese government's commitment to the circular economy is the $250 million Recycling Modernisation Fund. This will be underpinned by an agreement with state and territory environment ministers to reform the regulation of plastic packaging by 2025. We are also establishing a national task force on the circular economy to reduce waste and pollution, to improve product design and to transition to a true eco-friendly economy. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These reforms build on the $60 million of funding in last year's budget, which will be a catalyst for state-of-the-art advanced recycling solutions. These actions reflect our commitment to make up for the past decade of inaction and to take action to resolve problems created by the collapse of REDcycle. This includes bringing the supermarkets together and creating a task force, which has made strong progress already. Woolies and Coles announced they will take responsibility for the thousands of tonnes of soft plastics stockpiled in warehouses across the country. Earlier this month the task force released a roadmap with a path forward to resume soft plastics collection. The task force also announced that Woolies and Coles will start collecting soft plastics in select stores by the end of the year and expand in 2024 as more recycling infrastructure is available in Australia.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We are committed to helping the supermarkets resume collection of soft plastics and we welcome announcements that the supermarkets remain committed to this. These acknowledge the frustrations of people across the nation who recycle, who are responsible but who are now questioning the commitment. We must establish Australia as a global leader in this space as we move forward. That's why last November we joined our international partners in the High Ambition Coalition to End Plastic Pollution by 2040. We signed the New Plastics Economy Global Commitment, fulfilling the promise of the Minister for the Environment and Water at the UN Oceans Conference that Australia would sign up too by the end of last year.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These commitments are all part of this government's ambition to re-establish a circular economy. We are supported in these efforts by many in our regions. With rapid population growth, five of my local G21 municipalities are looking to build a $15 million regional waste resource recovery and re-use hub, which would be a 250-million-tonne facility. This would establish the foundations for a circular economy in my electorate, stabilising costs and, importantly, reducing landfill. From the federal to the local level of government, this nation is showing a commitment to reviving the circular economy and nurturing a sustainable region.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll conclude by quoting the Minister for the Environment and Water, who has said that she wants to see a plastic-free Pacific within our lifetime. With the Albanese government's actions in this space, we are well on the way. And we don't have a choice. We must do so if we are going to sustain our planet and the lives of all people who live on it.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Kooyong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:40</span>):  I rise to support the motion of the member for Fremantle regarding the need for us to take immediate and effective action to improve the handling of soft plastics in this country. We produce a lot of plastic waste. Unfortunately, we live at a time when using virgin plastic is still cheaper than recycling the plastic that's already in circulation. In 2019-2020 only 16 per cent of our plastic packaging was recycled or composted in Australia. We have a national packaging target of recycling or composting 70 per cent of plastic packaging by 2025, but it's hard to see how we could possibly achieve that. Our waste collection and resource recovery industry is very fragmented. Legislative requirements vary from state to territory.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In Victoria we've had multiple extremely unfortunate incidents recently in which tens of thousands of tonnes of recyclables have ended up in landfill and then have often been incinerated in industrial fires. At a national level there are far too few financial incentives for manufacturers to use recycled materials and we lack the technology and the infrastructure necessary to turn large volumes of plastic into other useful things. We have been far too slow in creating a circular economy. More recently, we were told that more than 12,400 tonnes of plastics were found in warehouses in New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia, much of which had already degraded to the extent that it was not suitable for reprocessing and will have to end up in landfill. While the government allotted $60 million in the October 2022 budget for advanced solutions for hard-to-recycle plastics as part of the $250 million Recycling Modernisation Fund, at this point we have no local facilities available to deal with soft plastic at this scale. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many constituents from Kooyong have contacted me to express their distress about the recent collapse of REDcycle's soft plastics recovery program. Emily from Hawthorn East told me that her 'conscientious household' was saddened by the failure of the REDcycle initiative. Miriam from Surry Hills believes that the undermining of 'community trust' is one of the biggest issues in this matter. John from Camberwell noted that the various government levels had thrown this issue around like a hot potato. Janet asked why we can't just ban plastic bags from supermarkets. Meg from Hawthorn East said: 'This feels a little like the straw that's going to break my back.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It is important to acknowledge that, as tragic as it was, the collapse of the REDcycle program was only a small part of a massive problem. Before its collapse, REDcycle was collecting less than one per cent of the 449,000 tonnes of soft plastic used by Australians every year. We have to use less plastic. We also need the ability to recycle mixed polymer soft plastics domestically. We need to be confident that, when we put plastic in a recycling bin or when we deliver it to a collection centre, it will be repurposed effectively, not dumped in landfill or sent overseas. This government has committed to addressing the woeful state of plastic recycling through combined efforts by state and territory environment ministers to reform the regulation of plastic packing by 2025 and migration of the softs plastics workforce. Last year Australia signed on to the High Ambition Coalition to End Plastic Pollution. In the last week the Albanese government has indicated that it will grant exemptions to allow Coles, Woolworths and Aldi to send our soft plastics offshore.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">None of this is enough. To end plastic pollution on our land and in our seas we have to decrease our consumption and our production of plastics to sustainable levels. We have to make recycling targets mandatory. We need a national kerbside collection of soft plastic, as has been proposed by the Victorian government, that is mandatory. We have to enable a circular economy for plastics in which plastic products are either recycled, reused or remanufactured. A mature country takes responsibility for all of its actions with ambition and with integrity. That's what we need to do.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Tangney</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:45</span>):  Thank you to the member for Fremantle for moving the motion. Our water is our most precious resource. Water gives life. It nurtures life. None of us can live without water. We are particularly lucky to have the best beaches in the world, but there is a very real threat facing the oceans, rivers, estuaries, creeks and streams in our beautiful country. Plastic is polluting our precious water. This is a problem all over the world.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Most of you know that I was a dolphin trainer many years ago. I had four dolphins that I took care of. My favourite dolphin's name was Ting Loy. He was a cheeky boy and very playful. We had a very strong connection. Whenever I got into the pool or water he would swim fast to me and always wanted to play with me. He had such an energy and always made me smile. But one day when I got into water he didn't swim up to me. Instead, he was lying at the bottom of the pool not moving. We had a vet see him and the vet had to cut open his tummy. There were a lot of plastic bags in his tummy—so much plastic; it was full of it. I lost my good friend. Do you know how his tummy was full of plastics? The pool was on the slope of a hill where there was a road and people used to drive past, stop and throw bags of fish into the pool. My dolphins would eat the fish and eat the plastic bags too. Even now when I talk about it I get sad and angry—angry at the people who throw their rubbish to create a problem for someone or something else, angry at people who choke our precious environment or wildlife with disregard and a lack of care. This was 40 years ago. Imagine how much more plastic has been polluting since then.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Microplastics permeate our environment. They leach into our water, our food. The average Australian ingests a credit card worth of microplastic every week. If we fail to act there will be more plastic than fish in the ocean, by weight, by 2050. If we fail to act our marine life, our wildlife, our food system, our environment and we as a species are sure to suffer.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Tragically, there has been very little action on recycling and plastic for a decade. Australians know this. Australians are aware and want to act. The modern world requires fresh, modern solutions. Our government understands this. At home we are rolling out the $250 million Recycling Modernisation Fund. This will expand Australia's capacity to sort, process and remanufacture glass, plastic, tyres, paper and cardboard. We are also investing $60 million to support new recycling infrastructure for hard-to-recycle plastics, including soft plastics. Three billion dollars has been set aside in the National Reconstruction Fund for clean energy, green matters, waste reduction and remanufacturing. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">On the global stage, Australia has also joined the High Ambition Coalition for an international treaty to end plastic pollution by 2040. Australia has also committed to work towards a common vision for a circular economy for plastic by signing the New Plastics Economy Global Commitment. Kids within my electorate often talk to me about the environment. They raise concerns about what the future might look like, and they fear that we have not done enough in the past. To these kids, I say: don't lose hope. There is always good work to be done. Get involved. I warmly encourage you to join your local community action group. One such group in my electorate is the Bottle Top Hill Project, a community sustainability program. Bottle Top Hill also uses the spirit of a circular economy to guide their activities and focus throughout the 12 months of the year. There is good work to be done, both at home and in the government. Let's get on with it for our planet, for our kids and for our future.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Wentworth</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:50</span>):  It was only the other weekend that I was sitting on Bondi Beach on a towel with my son and, in just a few minutes, picked up a handful of small pieces of plastic. There were bits of old bottles, a bit of a used shopping bag and a used cigarette butt, among many. Where once you could only find sand and rocks, now you frequently find plastic waste. Unfortunately, this is a familiar story for people up and down the coast. Australians consume more single-use plastic per person than any country in the world , except Singapore. I find that a completely shocking statistic. Every year, despite millions of households making their best efforts to recycle, around 145,000 square metric tonnes of this plastic leaks into our environment. This is causing a tidal wave of plastic pollution, and the damage to our natural environment is severe.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Our approach to dealing with this plastic is wholly inadequate. Our national packaging targets, which are so important for reducing the production of plastic in the first place, are not binding. As a result, they are simply not working. Under the voluntary scheme, Australian plastic consumption has increased while recovery rates have stagnated. There has been much positive talk about improving recycling but a complete lack of action. The most recent data available shows that only 16 per cent of plastic packaging is recycled or composted, some way off the target of 70 per cent by 2025. Producers must be compelled to do more. We also have a National Plastics Plan, which has only been implemented in an ad hoc manner, and a patchwork quilt of measures across different states and territories which are inconsistent and inadequate. We don't even have a common regulatory definition of the term 'plastic'. Even when we think we have clarity on what to do with our plastic waste, the REDcycle affair shows that we lack the private sector capacity for a truly circular economy. REDcycle was supposed to collect and reprocess only a small fraction of the total soft plastic waste generated in Australia, but that scheme was unable to do even that. it shows that the market for recycling plastic is weak and that far too much waste is being generated in the first place.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is an issue that really concerns my community, so last week I spoke at the Ocean Plastic Forum in Bondi Beach, an event for scientists, businesses, activists, industry and the community. There were incredible businesses and communities represented in that group, including Samsara and ULUU. Samsara is a business which was born of research done at ANU and CSIRO. They are developing enzymes that attack complex plastics and revert them to original building blocks to make virgin plastic. This is world-beating technology coming out of Australia. Similarly, ULUU creates a natural polymer using saltwater microbes that can effectively be used like a plastic. These companies are leading the world, but both of them are saying that poor government policy is hobbling the adoption of this world-leading technology. The message they had for government was loud and clear: enough is enough; the time for decisive action is now. We need to move past a focus on incremental improvements to anaemic recycle rates and adopt a true circular economy ambition. There must be a shift in mindset, and it must be a shift in gears.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are four key elements that the community is asking for. First, we need mandatory packaging targets for the industry that create much stronger incentives for much more ambitious action, so that businesses like Samsara and ULUU can really thrive and bring to bear this world-beating technology. Second, we need to get on with implementing existing initiatives, starting with nearly 40 action areas identified in the 2021 National Plastics Plan, few of which have seen any meaningful progress. Third, we need federal leadership to strengthen, coordinate and harmonise efforts across the states and territories so that we have a consolidated and consistent approach across the country. That will make it easier for businesses to do the right thing, if our country can get together and be clear on what those standards are. Fourth, we need to empower our communities and our businesses and support local action. That plastic forum I went to last week was such an inspiring indication of the community support for action, and the innovation coming out of our communities and our businesses to tackle this incredibly important issue. These organisations are working on the front line and are often best placed to support the development of meaningful solutions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The community backs strong action on plastic waste. Now is the time for government to listen. Let's purge plastic pollution for good.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bennelong</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">17:56</span>):  Plastic waste is a major environmental issue affecting our oceans and marine life, and it's filling our landfill. Every year millions of tonnes of plastic waste ends up in our oceans, polluting our waters and harming our marine ecosystem. It's estimated that in Australia alone we produce more than 2½ million tonnes of plastic waste each year, much of which ends up in our waterways. After a decade of neglect in plastics recycling and management by the former government, the new government is making progress towards a circular economy and reducing plastic pollution. The environment is back, and the circular economy is on the agenda. The former government had years to fix this issue, and they simply failed to do so. It has been over 1,600 days since they first announced their plastics reduction target, with the result being next to nothing. Am I surprised? Not really, but should we be angry about it? Yeah, we should. But what else do we expect from a government that couldn't deliver one energy policy?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To add some context, the coalition promised the electorate over 1,600 days ago that we'd have 70 per cent recyclable packaging by 2025—great target, but they stayed at 16 per cent for four years, which is not so great. I know the collapse of REDcycle and the supermarket soft plastic recycling system was devastating to Australians across the country and of course to those in my electorate of Bennelong. Many members of my community in Bennelong reached out to me to express their concerns about the program and to request the support of government to take action on soft plastic waste. We have a community in Bennelong that is committed to the war on waste, and that's what made this collapse so devastating. Like many who have written to me, I simply cannot bring myself to throw these soft plastics out into landfill. I've got about 10 bags collecting in my garage, just waiting for these schemes to start up again.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, thank goodness—not only for the sake of my garage space but also for the sake of the planet—that the Minister for the Environment has stepped in. The major supermarkets have now agreed to take responsibility for the thousands of tonnes of soft plastic that sit stockpiled in warehouses nationwide. Woolies and Coles will start collecting soft plastics in select stores by the end of year and all stores by 2024. Importantly, the government will invest in more recycling infrastructure in Australia. We're rolling out investments that the former government just didn't make. We've budgeted for a $250 million recycling modernisation fund and a $60 million fund to support new recycling infrastructure. We've also led the charge on reforming plastic packaging. That means ensuring that all packaging in Australia will be reused, recycled and reprocessed. We know that the minister has also put plastic producers on notice. If producers don't use recycled plastic, we'll force them to. We know that it is not only the consumers that need to change their habits on plastic use; the producers themselves also need to change. Product manufacturers must use recycled plastic in their products and the minister has put the industry on notice. The message is clear: stop using new plastic and use recycled plastic. We can no longer afford to be complacent about this issue. The time for action is now and we must act decisively to protect our environment and our future.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="282237" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mrs ARCHER</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Bass</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:00</span>):  I thank the member for Fremantle for his contribution to the discussion on the current state of the recycling industry in Australia and particularly around plastics and soft plastics. As co-chair of the Parliamentary Friends of Waste and Recycling, I have a particular interest in this policy area which stems from my time as mayor at the George Town Council, where I saw firsthand the challenges and opportunities presented by waste and recycling.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Like the member for Fremantle and I think most Australians, I was deeply disappointed by the collapse of our country's largest soft plastics program, REDcycle, last year after it was revealed that soft plastics collected at local Woolworths and Coles across the country were being stockpiled in warehouses. Although I understand that the issues around soft plastics recycling are complex, like many Australians I had a genuine belief that the soft plastics I was dropping off were being recycled, and it made me feel as though I was playing a small part in addressing the problem.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The demise of REDcycle has led to more than 5,700 tonnes of soft plastics being sent to landfill, which is estimated to be enough stockpile to fill about 3½ Olympic-sized swimming pools. Unlike hard plastics, which we can dispose of in our regular council recycling bins to be sent to a recycling facility, soft plastics are incredibly difficult to recycle and once they hit landfill can take up to a thousand years to degrade, which is a very difficult fact to swallow. It is a stark reminder that while recycling is a positive thing we should seek to reduce our use first.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There is movement in this area, and I do welcome that the government is continuing to invest in the Recycling Modernisation Fund, which the coalition first launched in 2020. Under the first round of funding a partnership between the Tasmanian Liberal government and the coalition delivered more than $9½ million in funding, allocated to improve our state's waste processing facilities. One recipient in my electorate, Timberlink, received $5.8 million to make a wood-plastic composite decking product to meet the huge demand in the ever-growing home upgrade market. Timberlink is using milk bottles, collected from across the state, mixed with sawmill waste to form the core of their products, resulting in the use of an extra 13,000 tonnes of high-density polyethylene plastic a year. A recent round, focusing on soft plastics, closed for applications last month and I'm looking forward to seeing the projects that will be supported by the fund and the positive impact that this will have on the state's efforts to address the challenges of recycling soft plastics.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'd also like to commend the government for the new container refund scheme known as Recycle Rewards, which is due to get off the ground later this year. Under the scheme, people will receive a 10c refund for returning eligible drink containers to designated refund points around the state, with opportunities to donate their refund to the charity or community group of their choice. This is a great initiative that will reduce litter and increase recycling as a whole and also support development of the circular economy. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's not just local governments or big companies who are playing a role in our state to reduce waste. We know that more can be done to encourage us as consumers to think about how we can reduce our own use and reliance on everyday plastics. One young student in my electorate, Maddie Hassell, has come up with an innovative way to tackle a common soft plastics issue. Last year Scotch Oakburn student Maddie, now in year 9, launched her reusable dry-cleaning environment bag, known as DEBS, after noticing how much plastic went to waste in dry-cleaning. She said, 'I'm always looking out for the environment, and thinking about creative ways we can do things to improve our community has been with me for a long time.'</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that effectively addressing waste on a large scale will require a combined effort of the right infrastructure, by bringing the biggest contributors of plastic waste to rethink their packaging and by encouraging the everyday consumer to reduce their reliance on plastics, which will be more successful with viable alternatives. I note the government steps in tackling these issues, particularly through the establishment of a national task force to reduce waste and pollution, improve product design and transition to a more circular economy. This is a positive step which will build on the pathway paved by the coalition's own 2020 landmark legislation, the Recycling and Waste Reduction Bill, which included $190 million for the Recycling Modernisation Fund and put waste on the national agenda for the first time.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Labor government's current approach to the Murray-Darling Basin Plan poses an existential crisis to what has been one of the great food bowls of Australia. Water buybacks are hanging over basin communities, including those in the Goulburn Valley, in my electorate, like the sword of Damocles. The Murray-Darling Basin Plan has many flaws in planning and execution, but there has been a general acknowledgement that the ability to use some water for environmental purposes is a good thing. At huge economic and social cost, basin communities have had recovered—and that means taken away—over 2,000 gigalitres of our most vital and precious economic resource, water for irrigation.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When water leaves an area, so does the economy that that water creates. If a farmer sells a water licence back to the government, the farmer may well be compensated, but the milk or fruit that the farmer once grew grows no longer, and the person employed in the supply chain that gets the product to the consumer is no longer employed, and our nation is poorer in so many ways. But, we have copped it. Two thousand gigalitres have already been lost to these basin communities. What next? There was a welcome addition to the plan that said that up to 650 gigalitres of this water could stay as productive irrigation licence, so long as equivalent savings could be found in environmental efficiency projects. Some of these projects have been delivered, to great positive effect, but the states need more time to develop and put together the rest.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Question 1 is: will federal Labor extend the time for these worthwhile environmental projects or just say 'computer says no' and adhere slavishly to an artificial time line of 2024? Do they care about people and the environment or do they care about politics? Also, when Labor signed the plan into law, there was a political add-on—450 gigalitres of extra water, on top of what has already been taken, could be taken from productive use and sent downstream. But there is an important caveat in that legislation. It can only be taken if it would have a 'neutral or improved socioeconomic outcomes' on the basin communities.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Some in this place have tried to argue that, as long as the water licence holder is paid, the socioeconomic impact is neutral. But to paraphrase a former Labor PM on another issue last week, because I have a brain I understand that any further removal of water will have devastating effects on basin communities: economic destruction, significantly reduced production and damaged export markets. That's the exact opposite of socioeconomic neutrality. There is also strong evidence that trying to push this amount of extra water down the river system will have terrible environmental impacts.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">People in the Goulburn Valley pose this question to me: 'Sam, we work so hard. We grow cheap, clean and healthy food for the nation. We've created export markets that benefit so many people, creating wealth and jobs. Why do they hate us so much? Why would they jeopardise our future by taking away more water when they know it would hurt us? They don't understand the environment here, they don't understand our economy, and they make no effort. Why won't they acknowledge that the deal was that extra water could be taken only if it didn't damage our communities? Why don't they understand that a deal is a deal?' That's not me talking; that's people in my electorate talking. I'm at a loss.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">You come up here with a spirit of goodwill and wanting to work together to achieve for our nation. But when you see the sort of attitude that is being driven by the Minister for the Environment and Water, threatening entire regions and industries, and therefore people, it is really, really hard. The government needs to re-evaluate its entire approach to the rolling out of the final stages of this reform.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="296272" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms MILLER-FROST</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Boothby</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:09</span>):  I rise to speak to the motion moved by the member for Nicholls regarding the Murray-Darling Basin Plan. I'm from South Australia as, I note, are you, Deputy Speaker Sharkie. We are at the bottom of the Murray-Darling system, and while the Murray does not flow through Boothby, it is important to Boothby residents and more broadly to all South Australians. The River Murray is the lifeblood of the state, providing essential water for irrigation, industry, domestic and recreational use and our precious wetlands and floodplains. The Murray provides up to 80 per cent of Adelaide's domestic water supply, and it's essential to the important environmental wetlands of Lake Alexandrina, Lake Albert and the Coorong. It provides irrigation to much of South Australia's horticultural, viticultural and vegetable crop production through the Riverland and Lower Murray regions.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The key to the Murray-Darling Basin Plan is that it requires all states—upstream and downstream—to work together for the betterment of the entire system to ensure the health of this important river system. I understand that this water supply is important upstream, but it is also vitally important downstream. As the mover of this motion notes, when water leaves an environment, communities suffer. That is what South Australia is facing.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government is committed to delivering the Murray-Darling Basin Plan in full, because not to deliver the plan is simply not an option. The CSIRO tells us that water flows in the basin are predicted to reduce by 30 per cent by 2050. While we may have had a series of very wet years recently, let us have no doubt that the overall trend is not a healthy one, particularly for South Australia</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">During last year's election campaign, I was proud to stand with Senator Penny Wong; the then shadow minister for the environment, Terri Butler; and the current Premier and Deputy Premier of South Australia, Peter Malinauskas and Susan Close, to commit to delivering the 450 gigalitres promised to South Australia. It was an issue raised with me constantly on the campaign trail, right up there with the environment generally and climate change. South Australians care, and the health of the Murray-Darling Basin could not be more important.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">More than 2.3 million Australians call the basin home, and in South Australia and the area I represent, many thousands more rely on the river system for a whole host of reasons. It produces a whopping $22 billion a year in agricultural production. It is not only essential to feed Australian households but a huge export to the rest of the world. The basin is also worth $11 billion in tourism annually. And it's an environmental marvel. It supports more than 120 waterbird species and 50 native fish species and contains 16 internationally recognised protected wetlands. The impact of a dying basin doesn't bear thinking about economically, environmentally or socially.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">When it comes to Murray-Darling Basin policy those opposite are true to form. The fact is they sabotaged the Murray-Darling Basin Plan put in place by the previous Labor government. They didn't want the plan delivered, so they didn't. Indeed, the Murray Darling Basin Plan is one of those issues that splits the coalition right down the middle. On one side, you have the Nationals from the eastern states. Basically, they pretend that the parts of the plan they don't like, which just happen to be the parts that are good for South Australia, are optional. Shadow water minister Perin Davey called the 450-gigalitre target an upper limit, suggesting only 62 gigalitres of water was needed for South Australia. In June last year, Senator McKenzie told the Senate the additional 450 gigalitres promised to South Australia was never guaranteed, and on 1 August, she tweeted, 'The 450 gigalitres is off the table.' This is while some of my fellow representatives from South Australia who represent the Liberal Party do their best to look serious and say that the coalition is committed to delivering the plan that we need in South Australia. Who are we to believe? We don't know where they stand on delivering the 450 gigalitres for South Australia, but we know where the Albanese government stands.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As with so many other policy areas, this government is getting to work cleaning up the mess left by those opposite. This government is funding infrastructure projects. We're buying water and accrediting state water resource plans so they can be properly policed. We are cracking down on cowboys in the water market, investing in updated science and working with First Nations people—whose knowledge of the system has been ignored for too long. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have already delivered more water towards the 450 gigalitres of additional environmental water than the coalition did in nine years. We shouldn't have to convince those opposite of the importance of the plan, but it appears we do. At its heart it's about fairly sharing water in the river system. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a>  Let me give a history lesson. While this was the Labor Party's Murray-Darling Basin Plan, when I became the water minister I took an opportunity to reach out for some bipartisanship with the member for Watson. I'm on the record in <span style="font-style:italic;">Hansard</span> for acknowledging the constructive way that we worked together, because we delivered the northern basin review and we delivered the sustainable diversion limits. When we talk about the fact that we have tried to tear this apart and tear away at the stakeholders of this, let me tell you that the other great achievement that the coalition was able to put in place when I was water minister was an agreement on the additional 450 neutrality and social economic tests. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me give those opposite more history, which is that the Murray-Darling Basin Plan is 2,750 gigalitres. We have recovered 80 per cent of that. All that the basin communities are asking for is the certainty to allow the infrastructure projects to deliver that water back to the environment through infrastructure and not through water buybacks. That is the plan which Labor put in place. That is the plan which I respected, as the water minister, and made sure that we worked with the states to ensure they were able to be given the time to deliver that water back to the environment through infrastructure, not through buybacks. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let me tell you, buybacks rip away communities. It's not the farmers you have to worry about. They put the money in their pocket and they go away. It's the communities that are left there to support them—it's the machinery dealer, it's the local pump shop, it's the local cafe and it's the local hairdresser. They are the real human toll of what this plan would be, particularly if this government will not give certainty to the states around allowing them an extension of time to finish those efficiency programs. They haven't been able to do that because of this little thing called COVID. Those opposite might have forgotten about that, but the states are asking for an extension of time to be able to deliver that water back to the environment without ripping the heart out of its local communities. Let me say about Labor's talking points that we don't believe and we haven't achieved anything. I'm proud of my record as water minister. I delivered more than any other water minister in this country. I delivered the northern basin review, the SDLs and the neutrality test, which on that plan is an additional 450 gigalitres. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The plan is 2,750. The 450—which was Labor's plan and they put it in place—came with a caveat of social and economic neutrality. Now what they're saying is that they want to walk away from that for political expedience. Yes, this is complicated, and people in Adelaide probably don't understand the technicalities of this, but the human toll is real. The human toll sits in Shepparton. It sits all the way up into Moree and into my part of the world. Let me give you an example of the human toll on the communities. A 68-year-old man in Dirranbandi, a town that used to have a population of over 1,500 people but went down to about 600 people, was the butcher. That was his superannuation. As soon as this came—and it ripped the guts out of Dirranbandi—this man's business, which was his superannuation, was gone. I held him in my arms as he cried and talked about his future and whether he had a future at all. That is the human toll when people want to play politics and take away the certainty that I had with the member for Watson. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">All of a sudden there's a new environment minister from Sydney who doesn't want to play by the same rules and the same intent that we have. The pain that we have taken across these communities and what we have done should be respected. Do not add this trauma. These communities do not deserve that. They have taken the pain. It is time now for some common sense to take hold, to continue on the pathway that we set to preserve these communities and to live up to what this mob, this government, when they implemented this plan, asked to be implemented. Live to those principles. That's all we're saying. The 450 should have a social and economic neutrality test. If they can't provide it, we should wipe it out. That's the simple way in which we should address this. This is bigger than what these politicians on that side are trying to run over basin communities. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Spence</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:20</span>):  I'm delighted to be standing here today in this chamber with my South Australian colleagues to speak against the motion moved by the member for Nicholls. The Murray-Darling Basin is of critical importance to the state of South Australia, so it's little wonder why the member for Boothby, the member for Makin and the member for Adelaide are here. I can even see the member for Barker in the Chamber too. If he does speak on this motion, it's indeed my hope that he attempts to resist the coalition partners and stand up for his home state, because that's what we are here to do today. We're here to stand up for the Murray-Darling Basin. We're here to stand up for cooperative federalism. There will be no ifs, ands or buts about this. We're here to stand up for South Australia.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">It seldom surprises me that the contemporary National Party finds supporting South Australia to be an alien concept. The National Party has not had an elected official in federal or state parliament in South Australia since 2010, and even then the member in question served out the end of her parliamentary career as a minister in a Labor state government—a Minister for the River Murray and Minister for Water Security no less. Nowadays it's akin to putting the proverbial fox in the henhouse—it is, of course, in the state of New South Wales, formerly of the one and only 'Pork Barilaro'. Those days are now behind us. Like many, on Saturday I will be looking at the TV sets to see whether we will bear witness to the formation of a Minns state government in New South Wales—a state government that could join together with the state governments led by Peter Malinauskas and Daniel Andrews and get the plan back on track.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Getting the plan back on track is something sorely needed after years of inaction and sabotage, whether that be by the federal government at the time, a state government or a bad actor along the river system. Those opposite, particularly the Nationals, criticise a plan using the slogan that it put the environment above people. They do so by referencing the environment as some abstract concept malevolently trying to push irrigators along the river out of business. I find this such an astounding hyperbolic way, not to mention an inaccurate way, to describe what the plan are trying to protect and safeguard. Are we not also part of our environments? It is neither a shock nor a surprise to hear those opposite believe the environment is something worth existing in any meaningful way along the basin. Their record on the environment and climate is pretty self-evident, but this time it really is an exercise in cutting off one's nose to spite one's face.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The environment is 120 different species of waterbird, 50 native fish species, 16 internationally renowned protected wetlands. The environment is $11 billion of revenue through tourism to the regions around the basin each year. Those opposite really would throw the baby out with the bath water without a pause for thought of the quality of the water in that bath at the time. To that end, the environment means that the 2.3 million people who call their own little patch along the Murray-Darling Basin home can have access to clean drinking water. You would not think we would be fighting over whether all Australians deserve clean drinking water, but I guess with those opposite we have hit a new normal that I am still not quite desensitised to yet.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This is why the Albanese Labor government is here to ensure the primacy of the Murray-Darling Basin Plan over whatever the Liberal Party had to sell off to keep the wheels on their top-secret coalition agreement with the Nationals over the course of the past nine years whilst they were in government. I hope the days of hostage diplomacy with the plan are now over. Threatening to walk away from the plan entirely if their demands are not met is a very short-term way of thinking. The member for Watson put forward a very succinct form of reasoning as to why cooperation was key with the basin at the time when he was the water minister in the Gillard government. He noted that for decades policymakers had allowed the Murray-Darling Basin to be governed as though rivers wouldn't respect state boundaries. This rings a great deal of truth, as, no matter what side of the basin you're on, inaction to save it will catch up to us all eventually. It is something we should avoid at all costs.</span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr PASIN</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Barker</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:25</span>):  The Murray-Darling Basin is home to 2.6 million people, who rely on the river to generate economic activity, provide local jobs and produce about 40 per cent of Australia's food and fibre. It generates $22 billion of agricultural output every year, which multiplies to around $80 billion up and down the supply chain. This water is vital for basin communities, for their local economies and for our national food security. By taking this water out of productive use, the Labor government is destroying jobs in our regions and adding to cost-of-living pressures for all Australians.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Let's be clear: Labor's policy will result in higher prices for fresh fruit and vegetables. Less water available for production means higher prices for what water remains on the market, and lower production means higher prices in our shops. It beggars belief that, in the midst of a cost-of-living crisis, Labor would seek to implement policies to effectively place an environmental tax on basic food production. Let's be clear: that's what this policy is—a tax on fruit, nuts, wine grapes, vegetables, rice, cotton, dairy and sugar grown in the food bowl of our nation. When those of us on this side of the chamber were in government, we vowed never to use buybacks to recover environmental water, investing instead in initiatives to improve water-use efficiency and deliver environmental outcomes for the basin with infrastructure projects. It was a win-win. We were maintaining production levels while recovering water for the environment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Given the trajectory of Labor's water policy, I'm extremely concerned for communities in Barker and the southern basin. Should Labor push ahead with the additional 450 gig from the southern basin and scrap the neutrality test, the loss of 450 gigs from irrigators could lead to more than $500 million in lost agricultural production each year. This is regional jobs we're talking about. It's the difference between seeing Aussie oranges on the supermarket shelves or Californian ones; avocados from Australia or from Mexico. Labor seems hellbent on pursuing an ideological crusade, and it's at the expense of local jobs, local communities and the next generation of irrigators and farmers, who will be priced out of the industry, all the while pushing us into food insecurity. Shame on you!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We've heard a bit from South Australians on the other side in this debate—at one point, in an interjection, all South Australians, but not this one. This one represents the river communities. With the exception of Madam Deputy Speaker Sharkie, who represents a small portion of the Murray in South Australia, I represent it. I'm here to tell you that the 450 gigs will not come at zero cost to South Australians. What is the South Australian contribution to the 450 gigs? It's 38¼ gigs. That's just over 10½ per cent of our whole allocation, or, if I want to put it simply, in particular for the member for Spence, who lives at Gawler: it's the whole of the Renmark irrigation district. He spoke about the Premier of South Australia, who, during the floods, had a penchant to want to visit Renmark. He'd fly up, he'd stand on a levy, he'd shake the hands of a couple of locals and then he'd make an announcement about some grandiose support program which was never delivered. Imagine all of Renmark turned to wasteland.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <span style="font-style:italic;">
                  </span>Of course, it won't happen just in Renmark; it will be spread all along the river corridor. It will mean the infrastructure we use to pump water around our communities, whether it's the Central Irrigation Trust, Renmark Irrigation Trust or the other trusts, will become more and more expensive, and less and less viable. It will mean we'll see, as we saw in previous times, the Swiss cheese effect, where you had productive block, non-productive block, non-productive block, productive block. It will see packing houses close because, unless you're at economies of scale, they just can't operate. Before the member for Makin gets up and says this is about South Australia—and brother I'm with you—have a think about the people in Renmark. Have a think about the people in Loxton. Have a think about the people in Berri. They can't all do what the member for Spence did and leave a river community in Mildura and get a cushy job with the union. Some of them are tied to their land, they have paid capital, they own those properties, it is their superannuation, and you want to pull the rug from under them. Shame on those opposite. Let's achieve this plan in full. Lets do it by providing an extension of time, let's do it in a way that recovers the water for the environment but doesn't do in the farmers in the process. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">

                  <a href="HWB" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr ZAPPIA</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Makin</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:30</span>):  The member for Nicholls is continuing the campaign initiated by his predecessor in this place to try and do away with the 450 gigalitres of additional water that was agreed to at the time the plan was put in place. I don't criticise him for that. He is stating what he believes his community wants and he has every right to do that. But I also noticed that, along with his National Party colleagues, there was an attempt to effectively do away with the whole plan in the last parliament that was not supported by the Liberal members of the government at the time. It never got up because they did not have the numbers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Putting that aside, I was part of the committee that went through all the Murray-Darling Basin communities back in 2010 and 2011 which looked at the issues they were confronted with after a decade of drought and at how we could best resolve those issues and secure water for the future. The plan came into effect in 2012 after literally 100 years of bickering between the states. Yes, it did not meet all objectives of all states but it was put together in the best interests of all the states. I say to the member for Nicholls: the 450 gigalitres of additional water that was agreed to at the time, which came up to 3,200 gigalitres, was still in total less than what most of the scientists were saying should be returned to the river system. Nevertheless, that was what we settled on.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The reality is that plan did not rely on emotions and misinformation. It actually relied on the best scientific advice available to the committee at the time. We also took into account future changes relating to climate change, where I understand the CSIRO is saying that, by the 2050, there will be about a 30 per cent deduction of inflows into the river. So if we want security for those communities, we need to plan in advance, because long-term sustainability is going to bring individual and community security right throughout the basin. I say to the member for Nicholls: I also, like the member for Maranoa, heard first-hand from farmers who, yes, were in tears. I don't dispute that at all, but they were in tears right across the Basin communities. I saw towns that had literally been destroyed because of the lack of water. I don't want to see that again either, and the only way we can guarantee that's not going to happen is to have a secure Murray-Darling Basin that is actually sustainable into the future. Because if it is not sustainable, it's a greater threat, not just to individual communities where water is being sold but to communities right across the Basin itself.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I note members opposite criticise the water buybacks. I did not hear a word of criticism when tens of millions of dollars of water buybacks went to people who were associated with members opposite—I'm sure members opposite know who I'm referring to—and there was not a peep about that. Can I also say in response to one of the issues raised by member for Maranoa about investing in infrastructure projects: my understanding is that the minister has already put that to the states on two occasions and not a single infrastructure project has been put on the table for her to consider. If it was, I'm sure she would have done that. So we go back to water buybacks, with water buybacks being the only mechanism left when you know that after nine years you haven't achieved the objective you are looking for. We still have more work to do.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I feel for the people in the Murray-Darling Basin. I also acknowledge its agricultural and tourism value to the nation. I also understand that farmers have put a lot of money into their farms. I get that. I say to the members opposite: I have a lot of relatives who are actually in that situation, and I understand that very well, but I also understand that it's in everybody's interest to ensure that we have a sustainable basin into the future. We're seeing that that is not the case right now, even with the fish deaths that are occurring right now and, similarly, what happened four years ago. Again, it's all about bad management of the Murray River system. I'm not particularly criticising anyone, but that's why we need a sustainable Murray-Darling Basin Plan.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Parkes</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Chief Nationals Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:35</span>):  I think it's time for a bit of history revision in this place. I want to remind the members present that I actually voted for the Murray-Darling Basin Plan when it came through in 2012. I'll take the member for Makin up on his point that the 450 gigalitres of up-water was not part of the plan that was passed; it was a separate deal that was done by the Gillard government leading up to the 2013 election to help marginal seat holders in South Australia. I'm not here to attack South Australia, but it's important that we understand the history of what goes on. I supported the plan—I have always supported the plan—but the 450 gigs was not part of the scientific rigour of the plan. It was a political decision with a figure plucked out of the air to help marginal seat holders leading up to an election. I think it's important that we get that part of the history right.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">With regard to the impact of buybacks, the member for Makin mentioned the fish deaths. The Parkes electorate is a third of the Murray-Darling Basin. I am the member in this place who represents more of the basin than anyone else. I was in Menindee five weeks ago in the middle of the flood. Now we have the fish deaths. To try and somehow obtusely link those fish deaths to buybacks or the Basin Plan is ridiculous. The reason the fish are dying out there now is because of the flood. The water has returned from the floodplain, bringing lots of organic material. An unseasonably hot couple of days has caused this organic material to deoxygenate the water, and the fish have died because over the last couple of years the river has been at such a high level that they have bred up to a very high number. This is a natural phenomenon, and no amount of political conversation could've stopped those fish from dying. I might remind people, too: when the fish died last time, in the drought, they died in the deepest waterhole in the Parkes electorate. You could ride a pushbike down the Gwydir, the Namoi, the Macquarie or the Macintyre. They were bone dry!</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One thing that's been frustrating through the worst drought that we've had is this misconception that somehow the river went dry because of mismanagement. The river went dry because it stopped raining! The idea that we have a plan that's going to turn the ephemeral nature of the northern basin that I represent into Europe is ridiculous. What we've seen with the drought and with the flood is that Mother Nature is still well and truly in command, and what we're doing with the plan is tinkering around the edges.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my electorate I have seen indiscriminate buybacks. When Senator Wong purchased water from the Twynam Pastoral Company, from Collymongle Station, the town of Collarenebri lost its major employer and 100 jobs. The cotton gin was dismantled and sold to somewhere else. The town of Warren lost a big proportion of its industry. We saw businesses close down and those towns suffer. When Senator Wong purchased Toorale Station at Bourke, the Bourke Shire lost 10 per cent of its rateable income. Those jobs that were supposed to flow from tourism or other things afterwards just did not happen. Those communities are shuddering and waiting for the next round of buybacks.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We have seen some great success in modernisation and efficiency measures. Indeed, the Macquarie Valley is a classic example, a modernisation project, lining the channels, shrinking back the irrigation system, putting some of the farmers onto stock and domestic water only. It took a big effort by that community and those farmers to do it, but it is now paying off, and they have much more reliability.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'll finish off by saying that the farmers in my electorate are growing more food and fibre per megalitre of water than anywhere else in the world. The reason they grow cotton is that to grow it in an ephemeral system you can't have permanent plantings in the northern basin. Quite frankly, I am sick of my farmers being demonised as some sort of evil people with regard to management of this plan. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Adelaide</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:40</span>):  I too rise to speak on this very important motion. The Murray-Darling Basin Plan has always been about managing and sharing water fairly so that the basin can sustain future generations. What we mean by that is that it has environmental flows, so everyone along the water can benefit—farmers, growers, people who live in cities that depend on the River Murray for drinking water, as we do in Adelaide at times, as well as the environment. Ask any South Australian—and you yourself would know, Madam Deputy Speaker—and they'll tell you exactly why this motion on the Murray Darling Basin Plan is important.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We haven't forgotten the millennium drought. Those of us from South Australia all remember it. I remember going up to the Goolwa lakes, at the River Murray mouth, and you could basically walk across it at one point in time, because the flows had diminished. We haven't forgotten that millennium drought, which devastated communities all along the river, and more so in South Australia. It also devastated industries and the environment. That was from about 2001 to 2009, and it is what led to the plan's coming into effect in 2012. We knew action had to be taken, for the benefit of growers, farmers, industries—for everyone—because without the sustainability of the river there would be no industry, no farms and absolutely no environmental flows</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, we know that the Murray mouth almost closed in 2002. As I said, I remember seeing it myself, seeing the lakes at Goolwa, where there were areas where you could actually walk across, and you could see dead fish. We certainly haven't forgotten the way it was. At the time, when we came into government we negotiated the Murray- Darling Plan and we basically put it into place, but at the time many in this place sabotaged the plan, or they weren't interested in the plan. That's a real pity, because that plan was for the benefit of everyone along the river. As I said—I'll go back to it—it was for the benefit of the farmers, the growers, the environmentalists, the environment, the people who rely on the River Murray, because without an environmental flow there will be no river.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There's no doubt that many in this place still don't want to see this plan delivered. One of the main components of the plan is to return an additional 450 gigalitres of environmental water to the end of the river in South Australia. This was based on scientific evidence. It wasn't just a figure that was pulled out of the air. It wasn't a figure that was just made up. This was scientific evidence. It was the amount of water that was required to ensure the long-term survival of the wetlands and ecology of the river downstream. If the river is not connected to the sea downstream, so that you have environmental flows taking place, the results are potentially catastrophic. Over the last decade environmental water has made a significant difference in keeping the Murray River flowing continuously all the way to the Coorong. Without this additional environmental water there would have been no flow to the Coorong for three of the last eight years. Can you imagine three of the last eight years without having flows coming through that Coorong?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">So, keeping the connection open is important, and it's also helped to flush more than three million tonnes of salt out to sea. That's salt in the River Murray, which cannot be good for the growers, for the farmers et cetera. So it's been essential for maintaining water quality in the basin, which is better for those people at the bottom end of the river who can still produce their products, grow their fruit and other products, as we've seen in the riverland. But, of course, I've got to say that, of the 450 gigalitres of additional environmental water that was promised, only two were delivered in the coalition's government over that last nine to 10 years—two gigalitres out of the 450. We know that some people are calling the target an upper limit. Well, what is the limit? If that is the upper limit, what's the limit?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that this government, the Albanese government, is determined to deliver the plan in full for future generations. We understand how important a healthy river system is for the entire country. More than 2.3 million Australians live along the basin. The basin is home to more than 40 of Australia's First Nations peoples. The Murray-Darling produces $22 billion in agricultural production a year and generates $11 billion in tourism for the Australian economy annually. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>

                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Ms STANLEY</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Werriwa</span>—<span class="HPS-MinisterialTitles">Government Whip</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:46</span>):  I'm reminded of the old proverb: it takes a village to raise a child. For each and every one of us there were hundreds of influences, both big and small, that formed us into the people we are today. The journey into adulthood was not easy and we needed all the help we could get, which brings me to our teachers—those we've entrusted with a large proportion of the responsibility to help guide and nurture our children. I've been told by teachers that, whilst the job is not easy, it can be very rewarding. However, too often we leave our teachers to shoulder this responsibility on their own, trying to face ever-rising challenges with ever-dwindling resources.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In my state of New South Wales, the state Liberal government's policies, such as the one called Local Schools, Local Decisions, led to the government abdicating its responsibility in the education centre, and this has cascaded into a staggering amount of casualisation in the teacher workforce. It has caused an increase in what are called full-time equivalent temporary roles. In layman terms, it means a teacher who is expected to work all the same hours as a full-time teacher, but who could be unemployed next week, regardless of how well they do. In just over a decade, there has been an 82 per cent increase in the number of temporary roles. Now over one-third of all teaching positions in New South Wales are temporary or casual.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I don't think you can expect someone to perform to their best ability when they aren't even sure whether they'll have a job next week. Why, then, are we doing this to the people who are responsible for educating our children? There's not much incentive to go full time either. The average full-time teacher is contracted to work 40 hours a week, but often ends up working more than 60, and less than half of those hours involve face-to-face learning. There is no overtime and no benefits. All this takes its toll. A recent survey found that 60 per cent of teachers were considering leaving the profession within the next five years. Just last year, one in nine young teachers walked away from the profession. With all of these challenges, is it any wonder that there's such high burnout?</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Since we were elected, the task for the Albanese government has been clear: we need more teachers and we need to keep the teachers we already have. That's why we're committed to working with state and territory governments to get all schools to 100 per cent of their fair funding level. That's why I'm proud that the member for Blaxland was able to reach an agreement late last year with education ministers across all of the states and territories for a national teacher workforce action plan.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As part of this plan, the Albanese government will invest $328 million, which includes $159 million for 4,000 additional university places for teachers, $56 million for bursaries, $68 million to triple the number of mid-career professionals shifting into teaching and $30 million for teacher workload reduction. That's why we've made it so that teachers who have worked for up to four years in very remote Australia can apply to receive a reduction in their HELP debt, and that's why we're delivering on our election promise to invest over $200 million this year to help every school in the country through the Student Wellbeing Boost and it's why all of the education ministers have agreed to a new five-year plan and over $300 million in federal funding to deliver the National Student Wellbeing Program. On that last point, any parent will tell you that the past few years have had an undeniable impact on student mental health. It should not fall solely to teachers to manage our children's wellbeing in schools. Schools will now, if they want, be able to choose a qualified student wellbeing officer or chaplain to support students. No-one will ever say that school is easy, not for students, parents and certainly not for teachers, but the Albanese government refuses to put this vital issue in the too-hard basket. Labor stands by teachers and always will.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Flinders</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:50</span>):  I rise with enthusiasm tonight to talk to the motion put by the member for Reid to recognise the extraordinary contribution made to our past, present and future by teachers, principals and school support staff. I come to this place, indeed, with a longstanding interest in education. I wholeheartedly hold education policy to blame for my being here today! I had the remarkable opportunity to work in education at both the national and that state level, with Dr Brendan Nelson and Julie Bishop federally and in Victoria with then premier Ted Baillieu and former education minister—my dear friend the former member for Nepean—Martin Dixon. Education stands at the centre of my inspiration for this place, knowing full well that if we get education right we stand to solve so many of the problems which plague Australian families. Education is how we ensure our nation's aspirations and prosperity.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I take the opportunity to briefly thank the many mentors and collaborators with whom I have worked in education over the last 2½ decades in this place, in particular professors and vice chancellors Glyn Davies, John Dewar, Peter Coaldrake and Margaret Gardner; and in the domain of schooling Field Rickards, Ben Jensen, Melodie Potts and Donna Hutchinson. Indeed, I thank my dear friend Mathias Cormann for tolerating my 4 am texts, falling at dinnertime in Paris and ruminating about the impact of COVID lockdowns and ChatGPT, on the OECD's PISA outcomes, the results of which I look forward to as most people look forward to Christmas.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Teachers are vital to this country's prosperity. They are vital to our culture and our impact as a nation. They are vital to our wellbeing, our curiosity and our capability in life. Teachers not only change lives but build lives. Today we need to teachers—thousands of teachers, thousands of young people—to come into this profession across so many different settings, not just the classroom.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week I officially opened the Abacus Learning Centre in Hastings, a building which seemingly miraculously appeared within 12 months and now provides one-on-one education and assistance to ASD children and their families. Specialist teachers work with children from across the peninsula in this wonderful fit-for-purpose space, which resulted from a $1.2 million investment from the former coalition government.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Last week I also visited the Oakwood School in Hastings, where teachers and teaching assistants work with young people who have stopped attending school. They quietly and determinedly bring them back to education with respect and empowerment. There are campuses in Rosebud and Mornington doing great work there too. Like Abacus, the program at Oakwood is carefully designed to meet the needs of each individual student. Students work with their class teachers and the tailored program focuses on developing each child's literacy and numeracy skills, as well as working on positive behaviours.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Then on Friday afternoon I met the joyful little people at Little Gum Early Learning centre in Dromana, with their loving educators who provide a combination of occasional care within an educational setting. After that I headed to the dynamic, vibrant and positively exuberant assembly at Eastbourne Primary School, located in Capel Sound, to present young environmental leaders with their responsibility and service badges.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">These four different education settings demonstrate a greatness both in teaching and in school leadership through managing complex needs and preparing students for a transition to mainstream schooling, vocational or other tertiary education and employment; by managing school disengagement, often resulting from family trauma; by providing early childhood education, as well as educative play; and by providing the celebration of community, curiosity and adventure, which so many of our school communities embody.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">School leadership is vital to encourage, nurture and inspire the future generation of teachers. I feel blessed to have met so many of our remarkable school leaders this year—people like Nick Schneider and Assistant Principal Michelle Bremner, reinventing literacy and phonics training at Baxter Primary School; Amadeo Ferra, currently leading the peninsula special school in Dromana; Ross Patterson at Balcombe Grammar in Mount Martha; and the gorgeous, a word I use intentionally for its technical meaning, principal of Eastbourne Primary School, Stephen Wilkinson. </span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Higgins</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">18:55</span>):  Teachers do much more than teach. They have the power to transform lives. Like the warmth of the sun on a seedling, their attention and care turn children into scholars, sportspeople and creatives, or a touch of all three. I still remember my year 6 teacher. Her interest and encouragement were enough. Several decades later—several careers later—and now raising my own children, I am for teachers. There is no question that my most engaging visits, the ones that leave me with the broadest of smiles, are to my local schools. The children are balls of energy, curiosity and wisdom. 'From the mouths of babes' is the utterance. Not far, standing like sentinels, are their devoted teachers, skilfully marshalling the life force in children towards purpose and self-exploration. They make it look easy; however, the reality is very different.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Teachers are struggling. The past 10 years have seen a 16 per cent decline in school-leavers taking up teaching. With a 50 per cent completion rate, followed by 30 to 50 per cent leaving the profession within the first five years, the teaching pipeline is leaky. This degree of attrition has set off alarm bells. The drivers include excessive paperwork, unpaid work and mental health effects. 'Get the system off our backs,' said one experienced teacher. Another who left my electorate to work in a high-needs area that she grew up in—altruism runs high in the teaching profession—is now contemplating leaving the profession altogether. High needs among students, exhausted parents, disengagement and, in many cases, hostility from parents towards teachers are an all too pervasive problem.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">AITSL found that only 40 per cent of teachers' time was spent in face-to-face teaching, completely back to front. How did we get to this point? Australia's teacher shortage has been 10 years in the making but, like other public facing professions, was exacerbated by the pandemic. Virtually overnight, teachers became IT experts, therapists and infotainment specialists while divided by screens. Back in the classroom, they had to contend with disengaged children who had fallen behind while battling repeated bouts of COVID. The Australian Education Union, at the parliamentary long-COVID inquiry that I held at Cabrini Hospital in my electorate, testified that five to six bouts of COVID and long COVID were not uncommon amongst teachers. My response was that this is completely unacceptable and it is one of the reasons I am chairing a clean air forum at parliament next week.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Parental pressure compounds teachers' stress, edging them closer to a tipping point. As a community, we need to recalibrate our expectations. A child's formal learning environment may be school, but what goes on at home is just as important. Teachers are not miracle workers. They are all doing the best they can under some pretty trying circumstances. I have seen what better looks like. Principal Sally Lasslett from Hester Hornbrook Academy, an independent school in Prahran for young people 15 to 25 years of age who have fallen through the cracks, does things differently. The school staff wellbeing program is an exemplar of what is needed to promote teacher retention. It includes mandatory debriefing with psychologists every fortnight, a flexible work model with four hours work from home each week and planning days and days off in lieu so that teachers are optimised to deal with the complexities facing their students. The power of teamwork runs strong in this institution, and their school awards ceremony was a joyous affair that screamed pride.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Albanese government's National Teacher Workforce Action Plan sets out 27 recommendations to be actioned by the Commonwealth and subnational governments, with $159 million to train more teachers in early childhood, primary and secondary education, $56 million for scholarships worth $40,000 to encourage high achievers to become teachers and $68 million to triple the number of mid-career professionals that switch, like Andrew, an engineer I met in Malvern, who is retraining now to be a teacher. We are investing $20 million in professional development and in a campaign to promote teaching as a career. Importantly, $30 million will help trial new ways of reducing teachers' workloads.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">'The meaning of life is to find your gift; the purpose of life is to give that gift away', said Picasso. At present, our teachers are like miners toiling away under heat and pressure to unearth talent. In that future we are shaping, they will be seen as social engineers, driving social mobility through the most powerful tool there is: education.</span>

              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">
                  <a href="201906" type="MemberSpeech">
                    <span class="HPS-MemberSpeech">Mr YOUNG</span>
                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Longman</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:00</span>):  I rise to speak on the motion of the member for Reid relating to the teacher shortage. I speak to this motion because I believe that, apart from parenting, teaching is the most important role that has the greatest impact on our country's future. We all know the majority of a person's thinking and behaviours are developed in their formative years, and the older we get the more difficult it is to change our thinking and behaviour—except for you, of course, Deputy Speaker Sharkie! This is why the value of parents and educators should never be underestimated. I've never been an educator; however, my mum was the primary school teacher her entire working life, some 50 years, in the Queensland state school system. I have close friends who are teachers, principals or deputy principals, and my wife is a teacher's aide, so, fortunately, I was able to have great conversations with them when preparing this speech. I also have a great relationship with the schools in my electorate of Longman and have been privileged to obtain the views of some of those educators this month.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The Commonwealth provides around $760 million per annum in university funding for teacher education, which is a significant investment, and rightly so—what price on a child's future? So why are fewer and fewer people taking up this vital vocation? For many years, teachers were held in very high esteem and were considered pillars of communities. Some of the feedback I've received from people at the coalface on why people are leaving the profession of teaching or are not taking it up at all suggests that many new teachers have come from stable family backgrounds and struggle to deal with students who are from unstable family backgrounds and who have behavioural issues unfamiliar to them. Those who have been in the profession for some time comment on the fact that disrespectful antisocial and/or violent behaviour has risen dramatically over the past couple of decades. One teacher told a story of asking a student to join the class, as they were going to a swimming lesson, and she was told to 'go away' and that she was a 'stupid' teacher. The teacher expressed that she was thankful it was this mild, as previously she had been sworn at and even physically struck. Another long-term teacher said that academic outcomes would be greater if teachers didn't have to focus on teaching students life skills that parents used to teach their children, such as manners, personal hygiene, sex education and respect. Every moment our teachers are educating our children on these matters is a moment they are not teaching them reading, writing, history, science and the like.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">One of the biggest deterrents amongst most teachers I spoke to was the often long and arduous process when a complaint was made against a teacher by a student, colleague or parent. There have been instances where cases were drawn out for as long as two years, and often the defending teacher was not even notified for months after they'd been exonerated of the complaint. There was also comment made about the lack of consequences for those students, parents and colleagues where allegations were proven to be false.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">A report in the <span style="font-style:italic;">Australian Financial Review</span> today reported that 50 per cent of principals had been physically threatened—simply outrageous. After the feedback, what are the solutions? Where do we go from here? Some suggestions I have heard from educators include: more investment in parenting courses and education on how to be a parent—if parents taught their children what parents are supposed teach, then teachers could focus and spend more time teaching what they are meant to teach; a more streamlined process for complaints and allegations against teachers, with time line limits on decisions to reduce stress on those who are eventually found innocent; real consequences for those who are found to have made false allegations; and a more diverse range of education delivery. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Once principal shared that our current education method suits just 30 per cent of students. That means 70 per cent of students are bored, disengaged or simply not understanding the information being taught to them. I have two of these alternative schools in my electorate of Longman, Horizons College and Alta-1, which both provide excellent alternative education for those students who are disengaged with the traditional school system. We need more focus and investment in more alternative types of education so that we can provide quality education to a broader range of students.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Many behavioural issues are created in our schools due to students feeling inadequate or even stupid because of how we measure competency or because they are bored or switched off as their education system doesn't suit their learning style. I sincerely thank our teachers for all you do under extremely frustrating circumstances. I promise you that I will do all I can to ensure that you have the working environment you and our children deserve.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Parramatta</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:05</span>):  I rise today in support of the motion moved by the member for Reid. Teachers are the architects of our future generations. Not only do they empower our youth with knowledge, skills and values; they inspire students and foster their curiosity and creativity. Without teachers, we would have no leaders, no thinkers and no doers.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Today, to be a teacher is to be an educator as well as a mentor. In many cases, teachers have to double as de facto social workers and counsellors. While there is no shortage of roles and responsibilities that teachers have today, there is a shortage of teachers themselves. The demand for secondary teachers is forecast to exceed the supply of graduates by over 4,000 between 2021 and 2025. That means there'll be fewer teachers in classrooms, higher workloads on those who remain and poorer quality of education for our children.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">This shortage did not develop overnight. Over the last 10 years, enrolments in teaching degrees have fallen by 16 per cent. Only half of those who start a teaching degree end up completing their degree, compared to 83 per cent of graduates across the board. Many of those who do complete their degrees don't stay in the profession. Approximately four out of 10 teachers have left teaching in their first five years.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Time and again, you'll hear the same stories and experiences from teachers right across Australia about the pressures they're facing. Last year I spoke to Alan, a local teacher from North Rocks, who told me about public schools having overloaded classes, forcing teachers to leave due to the intense workload. In some cases, the shortages were so severe that principals had to step in and teach classes.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We know that students have better school engagement, connect better with educators and behave better when they have consistent teaching staff. All too often, Alan witnesses the cycle of attrition. When a new teacher steps in to replace one that's left, they're forced to catch up and rebuild connections. That only adds to the mountain of pressures that teachers face on a day-to-day basis.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">It's incumbent upon us to support our teachers, retain our educators and encourage our community's best and brightest to take up teaching as a career. This won't be easy. It will take a long time to undo a decade of damage. Our government is working hard to deliver real changes to this system and to break the cycle of attrition. This starts with a $328 million targeted investment into our teachers through the National Teacher Workforce Action Plan. It sets out 27 actions that the state, territory and federal governments will implement, including $159 million to train more teachers, $56 million for scholarships to encourage our best and brightest to become teachers, $68 million to triple the number of mid-career professionals transitioning into teaching and $30 million to help find a trial for new ways to reduce teachers' workloads and maximise the time they have to teach in the classroom.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I am a strong believer in the power of education to lift our kids out of poverty and to help empower people to achieve their aspirations. I believe every child deserves the opportunity to access good education. But to have a good education, we need good support for our teachers and educators. For a decade, we've let our teachers down, and it's time to put that to an end.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">I rise to present a defence of the Australian bush. The Australian bush, with all its incredible creatures, is for so many of us the embodiment of Australia. The sites, the sounds, the smells, the animals and the insects it houses are uniquely Australian, to be found nowhere else on this planet. The Australian bush is as iconic as our coastlines and our beachers. It is a source of national pride, of comfort and of immense beauty, and, of course, it is home to so many threatened and endangered species of animals and plants, but we are destroying it. The <span style="font-style:italic;">State of the </span><span style="font-style:italic;">environment 2022</span> report made for utterly devastating reading for even the most hardened of political heads. It was an indictment of the efforts of previous governments to enact even basic measures to protect our environment and ecosystems from broad and deep destruction. The worsening breakdown of our climate means that our native bushlands will continue to come under ever-increasing threats.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">We all lived through horror of the Black Summer bushfires of 2019 and 2020, which burned for nine months straight. Over 243,000 square kilometres were burnt and destroyed and an estimated three billion terrestrial vertebrates were lost. The scale of the destruction was something that even the most experienced of firefighters, such as Greg Mullins, former head of Fire and Rescue New South Wales, had not imagined was ever possible. We have another El Nino looming, and megafires will continue to become more frequent and more terrible.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Add to this immense threat from bushfires the constant bulldozing of large swathes of our national forests year in, year out, deployed without constraint from our national environmental laws. In 2020 logging destroyed or degraded 40,000 hectares of Australian public native forests, 40,000 hectares of what were thriving ecosystems. Logging also contributes to climate change. Each year, logging releases greenhouse gas emissions equivalent to around six per cent of Australia's annual emissions. Trees are our most effective carbon capture and storage units. Logging also destroys critical habitat for threatened species. We are facing an extinction crisis here and the continued logging of our native forests is one of the major threats facing species like koalas, greater gliders and the Leadbeater's possum. Logging dries out forests, leading to increased risk of bushfires, and younger trees are also far more flammable than decades-old trees. Logging also reduces water quality in rivers and dams and undermines regional tourism. Perhaps one could understand the persistence of the native forest logging industry if it made good financial sense, but it doesn't. The forestry industry must be propped up with federal subsidies to survive.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">In the face of all these risks and with plantation forestry and alternative wood products available, the ongoing logging of our native forests makes no sense. The Albanese government must not stand by and allow this to continue. There is a simple solution. Currently, state based regional forestry agreements are exempt from the national environmental law—what is known as the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act, the EPBC Act. This means that the usual environmental laws that apply to other large projects do not apply to these forestry agreements. The effect of the exemption is that logging companies, some of which are state owned, do not have to seek approval or comply with the environmental protections set out in the EPBC Act. This exemption must end.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">While I welcome the Albanese government's commitment to reforming the EPBC Act, we cannot wait until 2024 to act on native forest logging. Importantly, I am not calling for an end to the logging industry as a whole. I am calling only for an end to the logging of our native forests. My motion also calls on the government to fund the transition to a plantation based forestry industry, recognising the importance of forestry jobs in regional Australia and the need for sustainable wood products into the future. Ending native forest logging would align with the Glasgow Leaders' Declaration on Forests and Land Use, the Paris Agreement and Global Biodiversity Framework.</span>

                  </a> (<span class="HPS-Electorate">Lyons</span>) (<span class="HPS-Time">19:15</span>):  I thank the member for Mackellar for moving this motion and providing me the opportunity to speak in support of Tasmania's native forestry sector. Few things elicit more passion in Tasmania than forestry. You are either for it or against it, or so some would have you believe. If you're for forestry, you're a redneck who hates the environment. If you're against forestry, you are a greenie who hates workers. It's a false and damaging binary, and it's time to call it out. This divisive narrative has driven Tasmanian politics for decades. It has served the Right of politics and it has served the Left of politics, but it has served neither the community nor common sense.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The truth is that native forestry and conservation are not enemies but allies. Good forestry is good for the environment. Forestry produces timber, a natural, recyclable, biodegradable and renewable product. Take a look around this Chamber and imagine it without timber. Our lives and our landscapes are enhanced by the presence of timber, and I want to see more of it, not less. Technology exists for multistorey buildings made of timber. Imagine that—the buildings of our cities transformed into carbon sinks with all the beauty that timber provides. The best use of any harvested tree is for sawmill, but every bit of a felled tree can be used, whether for pulp, paper, biofuel, veneer, or even for its cellulose, which can be processed as a bioplastic. Every centimetre can be utilised, and every centimetre can be regrown.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I have with me a sample of native forest from Tasmania. It's a prototype for a structural support beam made from offcuts of timber floorboards with a hollow aluminium core. It was developed by a young man called Nelson who, with his father, runs a small sawmill called Tasmanian Native Timbers in Elizabeth Town in my electorate. Nelson loves forests and he loves timber. Scratch a Tasmanian timber worker and you will generally discover someone who loves the natural environment.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">The member for Mackellar says forestry destroyed or degraded 40,000 hectares of Australian public native forests in 2020, but it wasn't destroyed or degraded; it was harvested and reseeded and replanted. In years to come it will be ready again for harvest. It's worth noting that in a normal year 60,000 hectares is harvested, not 40,000. That's 60,000 hectares out of a native forest estate in Australia of 132 million hectares. So for one hectare harvested in any one year, there are 2,200 that are not. That's equivalent to an area the size of Tasmania being harvested from an estate the size of 20 mainland Australias with every single inch covered by trees. It's less than six trees in every 10,000. It's a percentage of 0.06 per cent. Yet we are supposed to believe it's so environmentally devastating.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">To provide further context, the member for Mackellar mentioned the Black Summer bushfires of 2019-20, in which 7.5 million hectares of eucalypt forest was lost. That alone is equivalent to 125 years of Australian native forestry harvest gone, in cinders, over one devastating summer. Yet we fight with so much bitterness over what is a fraction of sustainable harvest. It's important to draw a distinction between deforestation and sustainable forestry, because I believe they are often conflated. Deforestation scours forests and does not replace lost canopy. This does not occur in Australia. By law, every harvested tree is replaced. Native forestry practice in Australia is nothing like the illegal operations that exist overseas, particularly across the tropics, and any attempt to draw parallels must be condemned.</span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">As the World Wildlife Fund states, forests are vital to life on earth. I share the WWF's horror that in 2020 the tropics lost more than 12 million hectares of canopy. Nearly 30 soccer fields went under the bulldozer every single minute, and none of it was replaced. The WWF knows that part of the solution to the devastating deforestation occurring across the Amazon, Borneo, Sumatra and the Congo is to support sustainable forestry practices elsewhere in the world, including in Australia. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">I'm proud to stand with my forestry workers and the forestry sector in Tasmania. It's world's best practice. We can be a beacon for the world. We can show the way and stop the pressure in Borneo and other places. I ask the member for Mackellar and the member for Kooyong to stand with us on that. </span>

As we strive to meet our targets of reducing emissions by 43 per cent by 2030 and achieving zero extinctions, it's imperative that we put an end to the logging of native forests in Australia. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Native forest logging is harmful to our health. We're now in the burning season in Victoria. Clear-fell logging burns are a necessary component of the commercial extraction of pulp logs and saw logs. They clear the land of a huge vegetation biomass left behind after logging: the branches, bark and downed understorey vegetation. They do not reduce bushfire risk to life and property, but they do render our forests more vulnerable to high-severity crown-consuming bushfires, with their associated risks to communities. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">There are days, and Melburnians know them well, when the harmful smoke emissions from clear-fell burns affect air quality over all of our state, posing serious health risks, especially to those with respiratory illnesses. We have to recognise this smoke for what it is: a form of industrial pollution with long-term impacts on health which benefits only private commercial interests. We are choking on the logging industry's slash and burn approach. Native forest logging is also harmful to rural communities. It impacts on their water supplies, their bushfire risk and their tourism opportunities. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Native forest logging is harmful to our economy. It's no longer profitable and it's rapidly losing jobs, yet it continues to receive government subsidies and protection. In 2020, the Parliamentary Budget Office estimated that immediately ending native forestry in Victoria could save as much as $190 million over a decade. That was before VicForests posted a loss of $54 million in 2022. In New South Wales, taxpayers paid $441 per hectare to subsidise logging of critical native forests in 2021. </span>
              </p>
              <p class="HPS-Normal" style="direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:normal;">
                <span class="HPS-Normal">Logging of native forests also undermines the potential of the much more sustainable and economically viable plantation sector. Ninety-three per cent of our plantation timber is shipped overseas. Rather than shipping plantation timber from western Victoria 6,000 kilometres to the Asia-Pacific region, we should be transporting it 250 kilometres up the road to the mills of central Victoria. We should be processing Australian timbers in Australia. We need to support the plantation sector and ensure that it thrives while rapidly phasing out the unsustainable native forest industry. </span>
              </p>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Native forest logging is harmful to our unique and precious wildlife species. Our koalas face a dire future because of the habitat loss caused by deforestation. Logging is creating food deserts as our forests are shifted towards junk-food tree species which koalas and greater gliders just can't eat. In Victoria our state's faunal emblem, the Leadbeater's possum, will be rendered extinct if logging continues. We have to take decisive action to protect biodiversity and ensure the survival of these species.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">Finally, native forest logging is harmful to our climate. It's one of the leading causes of carbon emissions in Australia, as it reduces our carbon stores and releases carbon dioxide into the atmosphere. This deforestation not only contributes to climate change; it also undermines our ability to meet our emissions targets. The regional forest agreements were originally intended to balance conservation and logging interests, but they are outdated and ineffective.</span>

                <span class="HPS-Normal">The forthcoming amendments to the EPBC Act present a real opportunity to make meaningful change. Firstly, we need the RFAs to be subsidiary to the EPBC Act rather than trumping it. The nature repair market bill that was recently proposed by this government seeks to hold participants accountable to the highest standards in order to ensure that environmental goals are achieved. The government has to lead by example. If it is genuine about repairing the environment, how can we, in any conscience, continue to log native forests? If we're serious about protecting our natural environment, we have to change the EPBC Act to stop native forest logging and prioritise sustainable land management practices. <span style="font-style:italic;">(Time expired)</span></span>
